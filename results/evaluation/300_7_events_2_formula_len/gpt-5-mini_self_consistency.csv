Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happened. The rules force after event6 -> event1, so event7 cannot happen in the next state; C1 is false.
- Even if we assume C1 (i.e. hypothetically event7 occurs), the transitions are 7 -> 6 -> 1, and from 1 the system nondeterministically goes to 2 or 7. That means event2 is not guaranteed (the choice could be 7 instead), so the implication ""if C1 holds then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 is False.
---

---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: after event6, event1 must happen. So given the actual initial event6, the next event cannot be event7; thus C1 is false in the actual run.  
- But C2 asks whether ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is guaranteed by the rules (i.e., whether event2 must follow whenever event7 occurs). We examine the required consequences of event7:
  - After event7, event6 must happen.
  - After that event6, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, either event2 or event7 may happen.
- Thus if event7 happens, the rules force the sequence 7 → 6 → 1 → (either 2 or 7). It is possible to choose event7 again instead of event2, so event2 is not guaranteed. Therefore the implication C2 is not entailed by the rules.

So C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step, succinct):
- Hypothesis C2 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds"".
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event2 happened,"" so Event2 is true.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since Event2 is true, C2 is true regardless of C1.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event5 happens, then event6 happens. (event5 → event6)
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds. (event2 ∨ (event5 → event6))

Step 2 — examine the facts
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true.

Step 3 — conclude
- Since event2 is true, the disjunction in C2 (event2 ∨ C1) is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: If event5 happens, then event6 happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine given conditions:
- The context begins with: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 is true (it has happened).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction ""event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since event2 has happened (true), the disjunction is true regardless of C1.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We must decide whether ""Event7 happens or Event6 does not happen"" (C2) is guaranteed by the rules starting from the given initial event.

C2 is equivalent to: NOT (Event6 happens AND Event7 does not happen). So to show C2 can be false, it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence in which Event6 occurs and Event7 never occurs.

From the context:
- Start: event5.
- After event5 you may choose event2, event3, or event7.
- After event2 you may choose event3, event4, event5, or event6.
- After event6 you may choose event1, event2, or event7.
- After event1 you may choose event2, event3, or event5.

A valid infinite path that includes event6 but never event7:
event5 -> event2 -> event6 -> event1 -> event2 -> event6 -> event1 -> ...  
All chosen transitions are allowed, and event7 is never taken.

Therefore it is possible for event6 to occur while event7 never occurs, so C2 is not guaranteed. Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event7 happens or C1 holds"") is guaranteed by the context.

Identify hypotheses:
- C1: Event6 does not happen.
- C2: Event7 happens or C1 holds, i.e. (Event7 occurs) OR (Event6 never occurs).

We must check whether every allowed sequence starting from the initial event5 satisfies C2. To falsify C2 it is enough to exhibit a valid sequence in which Event6 does happen and Event7 never happens (because then C1 is false and Event7 is false, so the disjunction is false).

Construct a valid sequence from the transition rules:
- Start: event5 (given).
- Choose event2 (allowed after event5).
- Choose event6 (allowed after event2).
- From event6 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event6 (allowed).
This yields a cycle 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> ... that repeats indefinitely. At each step we chose transitions that avoid event7, so Event6 occurs and Event7 never occurs in this run.

Therefore there exists a permitted execution where Event6 happens and Event7 does not, so C1 is false in that execution and Event7 is false; hence C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event7 happens or C1 holds"" i.e. (Event7) OR (Event6 does not happen).

C2 is false exactly when Event7 never happens and Event6 does happen.

Step 2 — transitions (from the context)
- 1 -> {2,3,5}
- 2 -> {3,4,5,6}
- 3 -> {4,5}
- 4 -> {1,2,3,7}
- 5 -> {2,3,7}
- 6 -> {1,2,7}
- 7 -> {2,3}
Initial event: 5.

Step 3 — exhibit a counterexample path where Event6 occurs and Event7 never occurs
Start at 5 (given), then take:
5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> ...
This cycle is allowed by the transitions and:
- Event6 occurs (at the 2 -> 6 step).
- Event7 never occurs anywhere in the cycle.

Thus there exists a valid sequence consistent with the context where Event6 happens and Event7 never happens, making C1 false and C2 false.

- C1: ""Event7 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e. event7 ∧ event2).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (i.e. (event7 ∧ event2) → event2).

Step 2 — logical assessment
- The implication (P ∧ Q) → Q is a logical tautology: if both P and Q are true, then Q is necessarily true.

The given event-sequence rules are irrelevant to this logical form: C2 follows directly from the content of C1.

Final answer: True

True

Reason: C1 asserts ""event7 and event2"". Any statement of the form (A and B) => B is always true, so if C1 holds then event2 necessarily holds.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (i.e., (event7 ∧ event2) → event2).

Step 2 — logical reasoning
- From basic propositional logic, a conjunction (event7 ∧ event2) entails each conjunct, in particular event2.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens OR C1 holds"") is guaranteed by the given rules, where C1 = ""Event7 does not happen.""

C2 is equivalent to: either Event2 occurs at some point, or Event7 never occurs.

To show C2 is false it suffices to give a valid sequence (consistent with the rules) in which Event7 does occur but Event2 never occurs. Starting from the initial event4 we can pick choices that avoid Event2 while still reaching Event7:

- Start: event4 (given).
- From event4 → choose event7 (allowed).
- From event7 → choose event3 (allowed; avoids event2).
- From event3 → choose event4 (allowed; avoids event2).
- From event4 → choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 → choose event3 (allowed).
- Repeat the cycle 3 → 4 → 6 → 3 … and occasionally go to 7 from 4 if desired.

This infinite (or repeating) trace contains event7 but never requires event2 to occur. Therefore there exists a model of the rules where Event7 happens and Event2 never happens, so the disjunction ""Event2 happens or Event7 does not happen"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event7 does not happen"") is true given the rules.

We only need one valid sequence consistent with the rules that makes C2 false (i.e., a sequence where Event7 does happen and Event2 never happens). Starting from the initial event4, such a sequence exists:

- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 choose event7 (allowed: after event4 either event6 or event7).
- From event7 choose event6 (allowed: after event7 either event2, event3, or event6).
- From event6 choose event4 (allowed: after event6 either event1, event3, event4, event5, or event7).
- Repeat 4 → 7 → 6 → 4 ... indefinitely.

This sequence includes event7 but never includes event2. Hence C1 (event7 does not happen) is false, and event2 does not happen, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is the claim ""Event2 happens OR Event7 does not happen"" (i.e. 2 ∨ ¬7). To show C2 is false you need a possible sequence consistent with the rules where Event7 happens and Event2 never happens.

Counterexample (all steps follow the given ""after"" rules):
- Initially event4 happened (given).
- From 4 choose 7 (4 -> 7). Now event7 has happened, so ¬7 is false.
- From 7 choose 6 (7 -> 6). (Avoid choosing 2.)
- From 6 choose 1 (6 -> 1).
- From 1 choose 3 (1 -> 3).
- From 3 choose 7 (3 -> 7).

This yields a valid cycle 4 → 7 → 6 → 1 → 3 → 7 → ... in which event7 occurs but event2 never occurs (at each branching we avoided the option 2). Therefore it is possible that 7 happens while 2 does not, so ""2 happens or 7 does not happen"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened.
- From event7 the next state must be either event1 or event4 (no other option).
- Neither event1 nor event4 is event5, so event5 cannot occur in the immediate next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Reasoning:
- From the context, initially event7 happened.
- After event7, the only allowed next events are event1 or event4.
- Therefore event5 cannot happen in the next state; C1 (event5 happens next) is false.
- C2 states that C1 does not hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 is ""Event5 happens in the next state.""

Step-by-step:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The rules say: after event7, either event1 or event4 must happen next.
- Therefore the immediate next event cannot be event5.

Thus C1 is false, so its negation C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses:
- C1: Event2 happens or Event5 happens (Event2 ∨ Event5).
- C2: If Event2 happens, then C1 holds (Event2 ⇒ C1).

Step 2 — analyze C2 logically:
- C2 is the implication Event2 ⇒ (Event2 ∨ Event5).
- In propositional logic, p ⇒ (p ∨ q) is always true: if p is true, then p ∨ q is necessarily true.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- C2 is a tautology and therefore true regardless of the event-sequence constraints.

Final answer:
True
---
C1 is ""event2 happens or event5 happens"" (event2 ∨ event5).  
C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (event2 → (event2 ∨ event5)).  

For any proposition p and q, p → (p ∨ q) is always true: if p is true then p ∨ q is automatically true. Here p is ""event2 happens"", so whenever event2 happens C1 holds. The background event rules are irrelevant to this logical implication.

Final answer: True
---
We want to evaluate C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event2 happens or event5 happens."" So C2 is the implication: if event2, then (event2 or event5).

In propositional logic, p → (p ∨ q) is a tautology: whenever p is true, p ∨ q is true; when p is false the implication is vacuously true. Therefore C2 is always true regardless of the given event-sequence constraints.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From event6 one allowed next event is event5.
- From event5 one allowed next event is event3.
- So a valid sequence is 6 → 5 → 3, in which both event3 and event5 occur. That makes C1 true in at least one allowed scenario.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., that both event3 and event5 do not happen). Because there exists a valid sequence where C1 does hold, C2 is not entailed and therefore is False.
---
False.

Reasoning: Initially event6 happens. After event6 one allowed next event is event3. After event3 one allowed next event is event5. So the sequence 6 → 3 → 5 is allowed, in which both event3 and event5 occur. Therefore C1 can hold, so its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
We start with event6 (given). After event6, one of event3, event5, or event7 must happen. Choose event3. After event3, one allowed next event is event5. Thus a valid sequence is 6 → 3 → 5, so both event3 and event5 do happen. That makes C1 true in at least one valid trace, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., in every valid sequence from the given start, event2 must occur.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true iff there exists a valid sequence that never produces event2 (or otherwise shows event2 is not inevitable).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules and the start
- Initially event4 occurs.
- From event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- From event1 the next must be one of {event3, event5, event6}.
- From event3 the next must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event6}.
(Other rules exist but these are enough.)

Step 3 — produce a valid sequence that avoids event2
- Start: event4.
- Choose event1 (allowed from event4).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 choose event4 (allowed).
- Now we are back at event4 and can repeat the same choices.

Thus the infinite cycle 4 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 3 → ... is a valid execution that never contains event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because a valid sequence exists that never produces event2, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. every possible continuation from the initial state includes event2). So C2 is true exactly if there exists some allowed run that never has event2.

From the context build the transition relation:
- 1 -> {3,5,6}
- 2 -> {3,4,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,5,6}
- 4 -> {1,2,3}  (initial event)
- 5 -> {2,3,4}
- 6 -> {3,4,7}
- 7 -> {2,3,6}

Starting at event4, choose the successor 1 (allowed). From 1 we may choose 3 (allowed). From 3 we may choose 1 (allowed). Thus there is an infinite path 4,1,3,1,3,... that never visits event2. Therefore event2 is not unavoidable, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — means event2 occurs on every possible future path (i.e., is inevitable).
- Start: event4 happened.
- From event4 we can move to event1 or event3 (choose to avoid event2).
- From event1 we can move to event3.
- From event3 we can move back to event4.
- Thus we have a cycle 4 → 1 → 3 → 4 that never uses event2, and it can be repeated indefinitely.
- Therefore there exists a valid infinite sequence starting at the initial event4 that never contains event2, so event2 is not inevitable.

Hence C1 does not hold, so C2 is True."

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. We start at event4 (given).
2. After event4 the allowed next events are {event1, event2, event3}. To avoid event3, pick event1.
3. After event1 the allowed next events are {event3, event7}. To avoid event3, pick event7.
4. After event7 the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event4, event5, event6}. To avoid event3 and to eventually produce an occurrence of event5, pick event5.
5. After event5 the allowed next events are {event1, event4, event6}. To make C1 false (i.e., have an occurrence of event5 not followed by event6), pick event1 (not event6).
6. From event1 we can again pick event7 (avoiding event3), and repeat the cycle: 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 ...
   - This infinite path never includes event3 (we always chose alternatives that avoid it).
   - It includes occurrences of event5 that are followed by event1 (not event6), so C1 (""If event5 happens then event6 happens"") is false on this path.
7. Since there exists a valid run where C1 is false and event3 never occurs, the disjunction C2 (C1 holds or event3 happens) is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 is ""(If event5 happens then event6 happens) OR (event3 happens)"". For C2 to be true in all models, every allowed sequence starting from the initial event must either (a) make the implication event5 -> event6 hold everywhere, or (b) include an occurrence of event3.
- From the given rules we can construct a sequence that avoids event3 and violates the implication event5 -> event6. Start at the initial event4 and choose transitions allowed by the rules:
  4 -> 1 (allowed)
  1 -> 7 (must avoid 3, so choose 7)
  7 -> 5 (allowed)
  5 -> 1 (allowed; here event5 is followed by event1, not event6)
- This yields a cycle 1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 that can repeat indefinitely, never producing event3, and containing an occurrence of event5 followed by a non-event6. Thus in this model event3 never happens and C1 (event5 -> event6) is false.
- Because there exists a valid sequence where neither C1 holds nor event3 occurs, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We need to check C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"", where C1 is ""Event4 does not happen.""

- Initially event4 happened, so C1 is false in the initial state.
- The rule ""After event4, either event1, or event7 must happen"" governs the next state after the initial event4.
- Therefore the next event must be event1 or event7 — in particular, event4 cannot be the next event.

So in the next state event4 does not happen, hence C1 holds in the next state. Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the claim ""Event4 does not happen"" (about a state).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, Event4 does not happen).

Step 2 — relevant initial fact and rules
- Initially, event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, either event1, or event7 must happen."" (so from the initial event4, the next event must be event1 or event7 — event4 is not an allowed immediate successor).

Step 3 — trace to the next state
- Since immediately after the initial event4 the only possible events are event1 or event7, event4 cannot occur in the next state.

Conclusion
- C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false in the initial state (because event4 did happen initially), but C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is true: in the next state event4 does not happen.

Final answer: True
---
We are given that initially event4 happened. C1 is the proposition ""Event4 does not happen."" C2 says C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state).

From the rules: ""After event4, either event1, or event7 must happen."" Thus the immediate next event after the initial event4 must be event1 or event7 — in either case, the next state does not have event4 happening. (The repeated/other rules do not affect this immediate next-step requirement.)

Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- ""Event6 always happens"" (C1) would require that at every step (including the initial one) the event that occurs is event6.
- But the context states the initial event was event3.
- From event3 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5, event7} — not event6. Thus there is at least one step (the initial one and the immediately following step) where event6 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 is false, so its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Interpretation: C1 says ""event6 occurs on every possible run (i.e., it is inevitable)"". C2 is the negation: ""event6 is not inevitable.""

From the rules (relevant ones):
- Initially event3.
- After event3 → {1,2,5,7}.
- After event1 → {4,5}.
- After event4 → {3,6}.

Construct a run that avoids event6 forever:
- Start at 3 → choose 1.
- From 1 → choose 4.
- From 4 → choose 3.
This yields the cycle 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → ... which never includes event6.

Because there exists at least one infinite run starting from the initial event3 that never visits event6, event6 is not inevitable. Thus C1 is false and C2 is true.

True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event6 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- The initial event is event3. That already shows a time point where the event is not event6.
- Also, the allowed successors of event3 are {event1, event2, event5, event7} — event6 is not even an immediate successor of the initial event.

Step 3 — conclude
- Because the initial event is event3 (not event6), C1 (""event6 always happens"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 says ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., every possible run eventually includes event6).

Start at the initial event: event7.
- From event7 we may choose event1 (rule: after event7, either event1 or event5).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3 we may choose event7 (rule: after event3, either event2 or event7).

So there is a valid infinite loop: 7 → 1 → 3 → 7 → 1 → 3 → 7 → ... This run never visits event6. Because such a run is allowed by the rules, event6 is not guaranteed to happen in every possible execution. Therefore C1 (""Event6 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., every possible sequence from the initial state must include event6).
- Start: event7 happens initially. From event7 we may choose event5. From event5 we may choose event1. From event1 event3 must happen. From event3 we may choose event7. This yields the cycle 7 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 7 which can repeat indefinitely.
- That cycle never goes through event2 or event4, and therefore never leads to event6. Because the system allows the nondeterministic choices that produce this cycle, there exists a valid execution that never reaches event6.
- Hence event6 does not always happen, so C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at the initial event: event7.
- From event7 we may choose event1 (rule: after event7, either event1 or event5).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3 we may choose event7 (rule: after event3, either event2 or event7).
- This gives a valid loop: 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7.
- Repeating that loop indefinitely yields a legal sequence where event6 never occurs.
- Therefore event6 is not guaranteed to happen in all possible executions, so C1 (""Event6 always happens"") does not hold. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reason: C1 asserts ""Event4 happens and Event7 happens."" The implication ""If C1 holds, then Event7 happens"" is logically valid because from (Event4 AND Event7) you can directly infer Event7.
---
You ask whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"") is true given the context.

Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 asserts: event4 happens AND event7 happens.
- C2 asserts: If C1 holds, then event7 happens.

Examine logic:
- C2 is the statement (event4 AND event7) ⇒ event7.
- Any conjunction that includes event7 entails event7; this implication is a logical tautology and does not depend on the background rules or event sequencing.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1 is ""Event4 happens and event7 happens"" (E4 ∧ E7).
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"" i.e. (E4 ∧ E7) → E7.

Step 2 — evaluate the implication:
An implication of the form (A ∧ B) → B is a tautology: if both A and B hold, then B necessarily holds. Since C1 already asserts event7, the consequent follows immediately.

Conclusion: True."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Initially event7 occurs.
- A rule states: after event7, event3 must happen. Therefore event3 will (indeed, must) happen — so C1 (event3 eventually happens) is true.
- C2 says that C1 eventually holds. Since C1 already holds (event3 is guaranteed after the initial event7), C1 certainly holds at some time, so C2 is true (and in temporal logic, ""eventually eventually p"" is equivalent to ""eventually p"").

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret hypotheses
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" = ""eventually (event3 eventually happens)"". (In temporal logic, F(F p) ≡ F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1.)

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially event7 has happened.
- The context includes the rule ""after event7, event3 must happen"" (repeated several times). That makes event3 inevitable immediately after the initial event7.
- Other rules (after event3 → one of event1,event4,event6; after event1 → event7; etc.) do not prevent event3 from occurring; they only describe subsequent branching.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0: event7.
- By the rule after event7, event3 must occur next. Therefore event3 does occur.

Conclusion
- C1 is true (event3 does eventually happen).
- Hence C2 is also true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 occurs.
- The rules state ""after event7, event3 must happen"" (repeated in the context), so event3 will occur immediately after the initial event7.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is true from the initial state.
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 already holds (it is true now), there certainly exists a (current) time at which C1 holds, so ""eventually C1"" is true as well.

Hence C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: Event6 eventually happens (in a given run).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible run from the initial state, event6 eventually happens).

Step 2 — examine the rules starting from the initial condition:
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7, either event2 or event6 must happen (immediate next).
  - If event6 happens there, C1 holds for that run.
  - If event2 happens instead, the rule ""after event2, event6 must happen"" forces event6 to occur next.

Thus from the initial event7, no matter which allowed choice is taken, event6 occurs within at most one step. Therefore event6 occurs on every possible run.

Conclusion: C1 holds in all runs, so C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event7 has occurred.
- From event7 the next event must be either event2 or event6.
  - If event6 is chosen next, event6 has occurred immediately.
  - If event2 is chosen next, the rule ""after event2, event6 must happen"" forces event6 to occur on the following step.
- Thus in every possible run starting from the initial event7, event6 occurs (either immediately or after event2). Therefore C1 (event6 eventually happens) holds on all runs, so C2 is True.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. whenever event7 occurs, the next state must be event3.

Step 2 — extract relevant transition rules from the context:
- After event7, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event3, next is {event4, event6, event7}.
(Other rules are irrelevant to C2.)

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- C2 requires that every time event7 happens, the next state is event3.
- But the rule for event7 explicitly allows next = event1, event2, or event4; event3 is not among them.
- Therefore there is a valid successor after event7 (e.g. event1) in which event3 does not occur next. This is a counterexample to C2.

Conclusion: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C2 says: ""If event7 happens, then event3 happens in the next state."" That would require that after any occurrence of event7 the immediately following event must be event3.
- But the rules say: after event7 the next event can be event1, event2, or event4. None of event1 or event2 force event3 next, so there exist valid traces where event7 is followed by something other than event3.
- Concrete counterexample trace: initially event4 -> choose event6 (allowed after event4) -> event7 (must after event6) -> choose event1 (allowed after event7). Here event7 happens but the next state is event1, not event3, so C1 is false while event7 occurred.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds."" In other words, whenever event7 occurs, the very next state must be event3.

Step 2 — relevant transition rules from the context
- Initial state: event4 happened.
- After event4 → {event2, event3, event6}.
- After event6 → event7 (must).
- After event7 → {event1, event2, event4}.
(Other rules exist but these are the ones needed.)

Step 3 — check whether C2 must be true
- For C2 to be true, every time event7 occurs its next state must be event3.
- But the rule after event7 explicitly allows only event1, event2, or event4 as the next state — event3 is not among them.
- Construct a concrete counterexample starting from the initial event4:
  - From event4 choose event6 (allowed).
  - After event6, event7 must happen.
  - After that event7, we may choose event1 (allowed). That next state is event1, not event3.
  - Thus event7 can occur without the next state being event3, so C1 can fail when event7 happens.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

We want to know whether ""If C1 holds (event6 always happens) then event1 happens"" is valid.

1) Interpret the rules as a directed graph of possible next events (duplicates ignored):
- 1 -> {2,6}
- 2 -> {1,3,5,6,7}
- 3 -> {4,5,7}
- 4 -> {1,5}
- 5 -> {2,3,6}
- 6 -> {3,7}
- 7 -> {1,3,5}
Initial event: 6.

2) Clarify C1: the natural reading here is that event6 keeps occurring (e.g. infinitely often / repeatedly). We ask whether under that assumption event1 must occur at some point.

3) Build a counterexample execution that keeps producing event6 but never produces event1:
- From 6 choose 3 (allowed).
- From 3 choose 5 (allowed).
- From 5 choose 6 (allowed).
This yields the cycle 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... which repeats indefinitely. It contains event6 infinitely often but never contains event1.

Therefore C1 can hold while event1 never happens, so the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (brief):
- The hypothesis C1 says ""Event3 happens in the next state"" after the initial state.
- Initially event4 happened. The rule ""After event4, either event2, event6, or event7 must happen"" forbids event3 as the next event.
- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 occurred.
- The rules for what can occur immediately after event4 are: event2, event6, or event7.
- Event3 is not listed as a possible immediate successor of event4, so event3 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule for after event4 says the next event must be one of: event2, event6, or event7.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Event3 is not among the allowed next events after event4, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:

---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 says: whenever event1 happens, event5 happens immediately after. But the rules say after event1 one of {4,5,6,7} may happen — event5 is only one option, not guaranteed.
- Initially event4 happens, so the next event is either event2 or event5.
- From either of those next states we can reach event1 and then choose a successor that is not event5. Example: 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4. Here event1 is followed by event4, violating C1.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the context, initially event4 happened. The next state must be either event2 or event5 (rules for event4).
- Take the branch where the next state is event2. From event2, event1 can happen (after event2, either event1, event6, or event7).
- If event1 happens, the rules allow the next event to be event4 (after event1, either event4, event5, event6, or event7). Thus there is a concrete run event4 -> event2 -> event1 -> event4 where event1 is followed by event4, not event5.
- Therefore C1 (""If event1 happens, then event5 happens"") is not guaranteed (counterexample above), so C1 does not hold in that next state.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. From the rule ""After event3, either event2, or event4 must happen,"" the next state must be event2 or event4. So event6 cannot occur in the next state; C1 is impossible (false).
- In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is true.

- Hypothesis C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" — i.e., whenever event6 occurs, event1 must occur afterward (eventually).

From the rules (allowed next events):
- after 3: {2,4}
- after 4: {1,2,5,7}
- after 7: {3,5,6}
- after 6: {2,3,4}
- after 2: {1,3,4}
- after 1: {5}
- after 5: {2,7}

We can exhibit a valid infinite trace where event6 occurs but event1 never occurs:
- Start: 3 -> choose 4 (allowed).
- 4 -> choose 7 (allowed).
- 7 -> choose 6 (allowed). At this point C1 holds (6 happens).
- From 6 -> choose 4, then 4 -> 7, 7 -> 6, and repeat forever.

This cycle 6 → 4 → 7 → 6 never visits event1, so event1 is not guaranteed when event6 occurs. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed by the rules; C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" In propositional logic this is P → P, which is a tautology and therefore true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"", i.e. Event1 ∨ C1. Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of the truth value of Event1.

Final answer:
True

C1 is the tautology ""if event1 happens then event1 happens"", so C1 is true. Therefore C2 (""event1 happens or C1"") is True (since C1 is true).

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (an instance of P → P), so C1 holds regardless of any events or the given transition rules.
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is already true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether Event1 actually occurs.
- The initial-event and transition information is irrelevant to the truth of C1, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the formula (event7 → event7).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- The formula (p → p) is a logical tautology: it is true in any state regardless of whether p (here, event7) actually occurs.

Step 3 — check the next state exists and/or whether C1 must hold there:
- From the initial condition (event5 happened), a next state exists (after event5 one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen). In any possible next state C1 is a tautology, so it holds.

Conclusion:
True
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 is the proposition ""if event7 happens then event7 happens"", i.e. event7 → event7. Any formula of the form P → P is a logical tautology, so C1 is true in every state of the transition system.
- C2 states that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is true in every state (including every possible next state), C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 is the formula ""if event7 happens, then event7 happens"", i.e. p -> p. That is a tautology and therefore true in any state, regardless of whether event7 can or does occur.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is true in every state, it is true in the next state as well.

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify initial condition:
- Initially event3 happened, and rule says “After event3, no other events can happen.” So starting from the initial state, no further events occur.

Step 2 — evaluate C1 (for context):
- C1: “Event4 eventually happens.” From the initial state (event3 and then nothing), event4 does not occur. So C1 is false in the actual initial execution.

Step 3 — interpret C2 and check it generally:
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” This is a universal implication about any execution where event2 occurs: whenever event2 happens, event4 must eventually happen afterward.
- From the rules: after event2 either event4 or event7 must happen. If event7 happens, then after event7 either event2 or event3 must happen. There is a valid path 2 -> 7 -> 3, and once event3 happens it stops (no further events), so event4 never occurs on that path.
- Therefore event2 can occur without event4 ever occurring (via 2 -> 7 -> 3), so the implication “if event2 happens then event4 eventually happens” is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened, and the rules state “After event3, no other events can happen.” So from the actual start state no further events occur.
- Therefore event2 never occurs in any continuation of the given initial state. A conditional ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is vacuously true when the antecedent cannot occur.
- (For completeness: if one ignored the initial constraint and considered arbitrary occurrences of event2, event2 can lead to event7 and then to event3, avoiding event4 — so without the initial-event3 constraint the implication would not hold. But given the provided initial condition, C2 is True.)
---
Step 1 — Identify the initial condition
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule “After event3, no other events can happen.” therefore means no further events can ever occur in this system.

Step 2 — Understand C2
- C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then event4 eventually happens."" This is an implication: event2 ⇒ (event4 eventually).

Step 3 — Reason about whether event2 can happen
- Given the initial event3 and the rule that no events occur after event3, event2 can never occur in any actual run of the system.

Step 4 — Evaluate the implication
- An implication with a false antecedent (event2 never occurs) is vacuously true. Therefore, within the given system (starting from the initial condition), C2 holds.

(For completeness: if one ignored the given initial event3, the rules do permit a sequence event2 → event7 → event3 that prevents event4, which would be a counterexample. But that sequence is impossible here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event3.)

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens in the next state (C1), then event1 happens.""
- From the rules: after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. That is nondeterministic — event1 is not guaranteed.
- Counterexample trace (consistent with the rules): event7 (initial) -> event4 (forced after 7) -> event2 (allowed after 4) -> event3 (allowed after 2). Here C1 holds (event2 occurs) but event1 does not occur.
- Therefore the implication in C2 is not always true.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e., whenever event2 happens next, event1 must happen)

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to event2
- The rules say: ""After event2, either event1, or event3 must happen.""
- That means following an occurrence of event2, event1 is optional — event3 could instead occur.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Because event3 is an allowed follow-up to event2, event1 is not guaranteed whenever event2 happens. Therefore the implication ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" does not hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the next state:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The rules state: after event7, event4 must happen.
- Therefore the next state is event4.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1 asserts ""Event2 happens in the next state."" The next state is event4, so C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens""):
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Since C1 is false, the statement ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event3 happens, then event3 happens. (This is the implication event3 → event3.)
- C2: C1 holds or event5 happens. So C2 = (event3 → event3) ∨ event5.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- For any proposition P, P → P is a tautology (always true). Therefore event3 → event3 is true regardless of any event rules.

Step 3 — conclude C2:
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction C1 ∨ event5 is true regardless of whether event5 occurs.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses:
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (i.e., event3 → event3)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" (i.e., C1 ∨ event5)

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The implication P → P is a tautology; it is always true regardless of whether P (event3) actually occurs.
- Therefore C1 holds (is true) in all cases.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 = (C1) ∨ (event5). Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event5.

Final answer: True

- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens"" ( (event3 → event3) ∨ event5 ).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- Any proposition implies itself; p → p is a logical tautology. So C1 is true in all cases.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction with one disjunct (C1) already true, so the whole disjunction is true. (Independently, the context also states event5 initially happened, so the other disjunct is true too.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event5 happens in the next state.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event3 happens.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen (so the next state after event5 is one of {event1, event3, event4}).
- No rule allows event5 to immediately follow event5.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence / check C1:
- Given the rule ""after event5, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen"", event5 cannot occur in the very next state. Therefore C1 is impossible (false) under the given constraints.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens""):
- A conditional with a false antecedent is vacuously true in classical logic. Since C1 cannot hold, the implication ""if C1 then event3"" is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- From the context: initially event5 happened, and after event5 the next event must be either event1, event3, or event4. So event5 cannot be the immediate next event — C1 is false.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" C1 says: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to event5:
- After event5, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen. That means event3 is one possible successor of event5, but not the only one.

Step 3 — check whether the implication must hold:
- The implication ""if event5 happens then event3 happens"" would require that every time event5 occurs, the next event is necessarily event3. But the rules allow event1 or event4 instead, so there are allowed traces where event5 is followed by event1 (or event4) and event3 does not occur.

Counterexample:
- Let C1 be true (next event is event5). Choose the successor event to be event1 (permitted by the rule after event5). Then event3 does not happen. Thus C1 can hold without event3 happening.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C1 says: whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen immediately after. This is false given the rules because after event2 the possible next events include event3, event4, event6, or event7 (not only event1). So C1 does not hold in general.
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state (from the initial state). Initially event6 happened; the next state can be event5 or event7 (after event6 either event5 or event7).
  - If the next state is event5, event2 cannot occur immediately (after event5 the allowed next events are 1,4,6,7), so C1 would be vacuously true in that state.
  - If the next state is event7, event2 can occur next (after event7 allowed next: 1,2,4,6). But after event2, event1 is not guaranteed. Thus C1 fails in the event7 next state.
- Because there exists a possible next state (event7) in which C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is the propositional implication ""event2 -> event1"", which is false only in a state where event2 is true and event1 is false; in any state where event2 is false, C1 is vacuously true.
- Initially event6 happened. From event6 the next state must be either event5 or event7.
- In both event5 and event7 states, event2 is not true, so the implication event2 -> event1 holds in each of those next states.
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state(s), so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 the next event must be either event5 or event7.
- C1 is the proposition ""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"" (event2 → event1).
- In a state labeled event5, event2 does not happen, so event2 → event1 is vacuously true in that state.
- In a state labeled event7, event2 does not happen either, so event2 → event1 is vacuously true there as well.
- Because every immediate successor of the initial state (the ""next states"") satisfies C1, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True."

False

Reasoning:
- Start: event4 happens.
- Choose the allowed transition event4 -> event7 (allowed).
- From event7 -> event3 (forced).
- From event3 -> event5 (allowed).
- From event5 -> event4 (allowed).
- From event4 -> event2 (allowed).
- From event2 -> event3 (allowed).
- From event3 -> event5 (allowed) and the cycle repeats.

This infinite path (event4, event7, event3, event5, event4, event2, event3, event5, ...) includes event5 repeatedly but never includes event1. Hence C1 (""if event5 happens then event1 happens"") is false on this path, and event1 does not happen either. Therefore the disjunction C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning: C2 is ""event1 happens or (if event5 then event1)"". This is false exactly when event1 never happens and event5 does happen (because then the implication ""if event5 then event1"" is false).

From the rules, starting at event4 we can follow the cycle 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> ... indefinitely. This sequence is allowed by the transitions (4→2, 2→3, 3→5, 5→4) and contains event5 but never contains event1. Thus there is a valid execution where event5 occurs and event1 never occurs, so C1 is false and event1 is false, making C2 false."

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. not(C1) — equivalently, ""Event1 does happen"").

Examine conditions:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 does happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. Event1 does happen) is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret C2:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → equivalently, ""It is not the case that Event1 does not happen"" → Event1 does happen.

Step 2 — apply the context:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event1 happened."" That directly states Event1 does happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (contradicted by the initial fact), so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ""It is not the case that Event1 does not happen"" = ""Event1 does happen.""

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context states clearly: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. Event1 does happen) is true.

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event7 happens and event5 happens.
- C2: not(C1) — i.e., it is claimed that both event7 and event5 do not both happen.

Check the rules and produce a concrete sequence consistent with them that makes C1 true:
- Initially event6 happens.
- After event6, event7 is allowed. Choose event7.
- After event7, event2 is allowed. Choose event2.
- After event2, event5 is allowed. Choose event5.

Sequence: 6 → 7 → 2 → 5. This sequence is fully consistent with the given ""after ..."" rules and includes both event7 and event5, so C1 can hold.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true. Final answer: False.
---
We want to know whether ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is true given the rules and initial event6.

Check if C1 (both event7 and event5 occur) can happen in some sequence starting from event6.

From the rules:
- After event6 we can go to event2 (among other choices).
- After event2 we can go to event5.
- After event5 we can go to event7.

So one valid sequence is: 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7. That sequence contains both event5 and event7, so C1 can hold.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false. Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happened.
- From event6, one of {event2, event4, event7} must happen next. Choose event7.
- From event7, one of {event1, event2, event4, event6} must happen next. Choose event2.
- From event2, one of {event1, event5, event7} must happen next. Choose event5.

This yields the sequence 6 → 7 → 2 → 5, so both event7 and event5 can happen. Therefore C1 (event7 and event5 happen) is possible, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules: after event2, event3 must happen; after event3, either event2 or event5 happens.
- Starting from the initial event6, choose the allowed transitions: 6 → 3 → 2.
- From 2 we must go to 3, and from 3 we can choose to go back to 2. So the infinite loop 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... is a valid execution that never visits event4.
- That execution shows an occurrence of event2 that is not followed (ever) by event4, so C1 (""If event2 happens, then event4 happens"") does not hold in general.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false.
---
We treat the description as a nondeterministic transition system between events 1–7, with initial event6. C1 says: whenever event2 happens, event4 happens (i.e., after an occurrence of event2, event4 must occur). C2 says that C1 eventually holds (i.e., at some point the system satisfies C1).

Check the transitions relevant to event2 and event4:
- After event2, event3 must happen (2 → 3).
- After event3, either event2 or event5 happens (3 → {2,5}).
- After event5, either event2 or event6 happens (5 → {2,6}).
- From event6 you can go to event3 (6 → {1,3,7} includes 3).
- Event4 can only be reached from event1 or event7 (1 → {3,4,5,7}; 7 → {1,3,4,6}).

There is a reachable infinite loop that never visits event4: start at initial 6, choose 3 (6 → 3), then choose 2 (3 → 2), then 3 (2 → 3), then 2, and so on forever alternating 2 ↔ 3. This path is allowed by the rules and never reaches event4. Along that path, event2 occurs but event4 never occurs afterward, so C1 is violated on that execution. Because such an infinite execution exists, C1 does not hold in general and cannot be said to “eventually” hold (there is no guarantee that from some point on the system will enforce C1 on all future behavior).

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event6 has happened.
- From event6 one possible next is event3 (6 -> 3).
- From event3 one allowed next is event2 (3 -> 2).
- From event2 the next must be event3 (2 -> 3).
- Thus it is possible to loop: 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... indefinitely.

Because 3 can keep choosing 2, this loop prevents event4 ever occurring on that run. C1 (""If event2 happens, then event4 happens"") is therefore not guaranteed (there are occurrences of event2 that are not followed by event4), and C1 never becomes true on that infinite run. Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Start: event2 happens.
- From event2 you can go to event1 (allowed).
- From event1 you can go back to event2 (allowed).
- Repeating the choices 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... produces an infinite sequence that never includes event6.

Because there exists at least one valid sequence starting from the initial event2 that avoids event6 forever, the claim ""Event6 always happens"" (C1) is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the claim:
- C1: Event6 always happens (i.e., in every possible future sequence eventually event6 occurs).
- C2: C1 does not hold (negation of C1).

Step 2 — Examine the rules and start:
- Start at event2.
- Allowed transitions include: 2 -> 1 or 3; 1 -> 2 or 7; 3 -> 1; (others exist but not needed).

Step 3 — Exhibit a counterexample to ""Event6 always happens"":
- From 2 you can go to 1; from 1 you can go back to 2. So the infinite sequence 2,1,2,1,... is allowed by the rules and never includes event6.

Conclusion:
- Since there is a valid sequence that never reaches event6, event6 is not guaranteed to happen. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Final answer: True
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 says ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., every possible future sequence must contain event6). So C2 is true if there exists at least one valid sequence starting from the initial event that never includes event6.

From the given transitions:
- e1 -> {e2, e7}
- e2 -> {e1, e3}
- e3 -> {e1}
- e4 -> {e2, e5, e6}
- e5 -> {e1, e2, e3, e6, e7}
- e6 -> {e1, e4, e7}
- e7 -> {e2, e4, e5, e6}

Initial event is e2. From e2 we may go to e1; from e1 we may go back to e2. Thus the infinite alternating sequence e2, e1, e2, e1, ... is a valid run that never visits event6. Because such a run exists, event6 is not guaranteed to always happen.

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") must be true given the rules and initial event6.

Interpretation:
- C1: Event4 does not happen (i.e., event4 never occurs).
- C2: Event3 occurs at some point OR C1 holds.
We ask whether C2 is guaranteed (true on every allowed sequence) starting from the initial event6.

Key allowed transitions (from the context):
- After 6 → {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- After 4 → {3, 6}
- (After 3 → {4, 6, 7}, etc.)

Counterexample trace:
Start at 6. Choose the successor 4 (allowed). From 4 choose successor 6 (allowed). Repeat: 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 → ...
This infinite run contains event4 (so C1 is false) and never contains event3 (so ""Event3 happens"" is false). Thus C2 (Event3 happens or C1) is false on this allowed execution.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed; answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 you may go to event4 (allowed).
- From event4 you may go to event6 (allowed) — this avoids event3.
- From event6 you may go to event2 (allowed).
- From event2 you may go to event4 (allowed) — again avoiding event3.
- The cycle 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 can be repeated indefinitely, so event4 does occur while event3 never needs to occur.
- Therefore C1 (event4 does not happen) can be false and event3 can also be false, making C2 (event3 happens or C1 holds) false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event4 does not happen"". So C2 is equivalent to (event3) OR (not event4).
- To make C2 false we need both: event3 never happens AND event4 does happen.
- Start from the initial event6. From the rules, 6 -> 4 is allowed, and from 4 -> 6 is allowed (4's only options are 3 or 6).
- So the infinite sequence 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, ... is valid under the rules: it includes event4 and never includes event3.
- In that sequence C1 is false (event4 happens) and event3 does not happen, so C2 is false.

Thus C2 is not guaranteed by the context: False."

We want to evaluate C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens,"" where C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Step 1 — interpret the rules (transitions)
- Start: event6.
- Edges (after X -> possible next): 
  1 -> {2,3,6,7}
  2 -> {4,5}
  3 -> {2,4,5,6,7}
  4 -> {1,3,5,7}
  5 -> {3,4,6}
  6 -> {2,4,5}
  7 -> {1,2,3}

Step 2 — show C1 is impossible
- From initial 6 the next event can be 2,4, or 5. So you might get a 2 at that first step.
- But after event2 the only possible next events are 4 or 5 — there is no transition 2 -> 2.
- Thus you cannot have event2 at every step (you cannot stay at 2 forever), so ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is impossible under the given rules.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- An implication ""If C1 then event3"" is true whenever the antecedent C1 is impossible (vacuously true).
- Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 says: after event7, event5 must happen.
- From the initial event1, the next event can be event4.
- After event4, event7 must happen.
- After event7, the rules allow event2 or event3 (not event5).
Thus in the next-state scenario (choose event4), event7 can occur and is not followed by event5, so C1 does not hold in the next state.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened. After event1, the next event can be event2, event3, event4, or event6.
- Consider the next state where event2 happened (this is a valid next state).
- After event2, event7 is a possible next event.
- After event7, the only possible next events are event2 or event3 — event5 never follows event7 (and in fact no rule ever makes event5 occur).
- Therefore in that next state (the one reached by event2) the implication ""if event7 happens then event5 happens"" (C1) is false.
- Since C1 does not hold in at least one possible next state, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event7 happens, then event5 happens."" (event7 → event5)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e. in the immediate successor state, the implication event7 → event5 is true)

Step 2 — examine the transitions from the initial state
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1, the next event must be one of: {event2, event3, event4, event6}.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in each possible next state
- In each of those next states the actual event is one of 2,3,4,6 — event7 does not occur in any of these next states.
- An implication (event7 → event5) is true whenever event7 is false (vacuously true).

Conclusion
- In every possible next state, C1 is true. Therefore C2 is True."

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event5 occurred.
- The rule ""After event5, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen"" fixes the immediate next state to one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- Event3 is not among those, so C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
We start from the initial event: event5 happened. The rules say: after event5, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}. Event3 is not among those options, so event3 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false, so its negation C2 is true.

True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does NOT happen in the next state).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Since the only allowed next events after event5 are 1, 2, or 4, event3 cannot be the next event.
- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (that C1 does not hold) is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1 says: whenever event7 happens, event4 happens (i.e., every occurrence of 7 is followed by 4).
2. C2 says that C1 eventually holds (there is a time after which every later occurrence of 7 is followed by 4).
3. From the rules and the initial event:
   - Initially event5 occurs.
   - After event5 one allowed next event is event1 (5 → 1 is permitted).
   - After event1 one allowed next event is event7 (1 → 7 is permitted).
   - After event7 one allowed next event is event1 (7 → 1 is permitted).
4. Therefore we can produce the infinite cycle … → 1 → 7 → 1 → 7 → … in which every occurrence of 7 is followed by 1, never by 4.
5. That cycle is consistent with the given rules and shows that there is a valid execution in which C1 never becomes true for all future 7’s. Hence there is no guarantee that C1 will eventually hold.

So C2 is False.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context we have these possible transitions:
  - 1 -> {2,4,6,7}
  - 2 -> {5,6,7}
  - 3 -> {6}
  - 4 -> {1,2,3,5,7}
  - 5 -> {1,2,3,6}
  - 6 -> {3,5}
  - 7 -> {1,2,4,5}
- Initially event5 happens.
- C1 says: ""If event7 happens, then event4 happens."" The rules for successors of 7 allow 1,2,4, or 5 — 4 is only one possibility, not mandatory.
- Construct a concrete execution that violates C1: 5 (initial) -> choose 1 (allowed from 5) -> choose 7 (allowed from 1) -> choose 1 (allowed from 7). Here event7 happened but the next event was 1, not 4, so C1 is false at that point.
- Because the transition rules are static (they keep allowing non-4 successors of 7), C1 will not become invariably true in the future. Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" is false.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event6 happens and event7 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., not(both 6 and 7 happen)).

Step 2 — use the rules to find a sequence that satisfies or refutes C1:
- Initially event7 happened (given).
- After event7, one of {event1, event3, event6} must happen.
- Choose event6 next. After event6 no other events can happen (terminal).

Thus the sequence 7 → 6 is allowed by the rules, and both event7 and event6 happen. So C1 is true (it is possible that both event6 and event7 happen).

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning: initially event7 has happened, and after event7 one of {event1, event3, event6} must happen. Choosing event6 yields the sequence 7 -> 6, so both event7 and event6 can occur. Thus C1 (event6 and event7 happen) is possible, so its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event6 happens and event7 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., it's not the case that both 6 and 7 happen).

Step 2 — examine conditions and possible sequence
- Initially event7 has happened.
- After event7, one of {event1, event3, event6} must happen.
- If we choose event6 after the initial event7, the sequence is 7 → 6.
- After event6, no other events can happen (6 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- In the sequence 7 → 6 both event7 and event6 occur, so C1 can be true.
- Since C1 is possible under the given rules, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true in all models; therefore C2 is false.

We want to check whether ""If event4 eventually happens (C1), then event3 happens"" is guaranteed.

Transitions (condensed):
- 3 -> {2,6}
- 6 -> {1,3,7}
- 1 -> {3,6,7}
- 7 -> {1,2,3,4,5}
- 2 -> {1,4,5,6,7}
- 4 -> {1,2,3}
- 5 -> {2,4,6}

We can reach event4 from the start: 3 -> 2 -> 4, so C1 can hold.

But after event4 we can choose 4 -> 2, and then 2 -> 4, forming the cycle 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> ... This cycle never includes event3, so once event4 has happened, it is possible to continue in a way that avoids event3 forever.

Therefore C2 (that event3 must happen whenever event4 occurs) is not guaranteed. Answer: False.

C1 is simply ""event3 happens"" (since ""event3 or event3"" is just event3). C2 states: if event2 happens then event3 happens.

Counterexample showing C2 fails:
- Start (given): event5.
- Choose 5 -> 6 (allowed).
- Choose 6 -> 2 (allowed). Now event2 has happened.
- From 2 choose 2 -> 5 (allowed).
- From 5 choose 5 -> 4 (allowed).
- From 4 choose 4 -> 5 (allowed).
Now we can repeat 5 -> 4 -> 5 indefinitely, never taking any transition that produces event3 (options that would produce 3 are avoidable at each choice). Thus there is a permissible run where event2 occurs but event3 never does, so ""if event2 then event3"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
C1 is just ""event3 happens"" (the disjunction is the same disjunct twice). C2 says: if event2 happens then event3 happens.

Counterexample path from the given rules (all choices allowed where ""either ... must happen"" gives a branch):
- Initially event5.
- From event5 choose event6.
- From event6 choose event2.
- From event2 choose event5.
- From event5 choose event6.
- From event6 choose event2.
- Repeat indefinitely.

This infinite cycle (5 → 6 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 2 → ...) never produces event3, so event2 can occur without event3 ever happening. Therefore C2 is not entailed by the rules.

Final answer: False

C1 is just ""event3 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same disjunct). C2 says: if event2 happens, then event3 happens.

We can build a concrete counterexample trace from the given rules starting at the initial event5:

- Start: event5 (initial).
- From event5 choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 choose event2 (allowed). Now event2 has happened.
- From event2 choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 choose event5 (allowed).
- Repeat 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 ... forever.

This trace contains event2 but never contains event3 (we always choose the transitions that avoid event3). Therefore it is possible for event2 to occur without event3 ever occurring, so ""if event2 then event3"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: event4 happens or event3 happens.
- C2: event6 happens or C1 holds.
We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — use the given facts
- The context begins by stating: ""Initially, event6 happened."" So ""event6 happens"" is a true fact.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction: ""event6 happens OR C1"". Since event6 happens is true, the disjunction is true regardless of C1.

Conclusion: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event4 or event3"".
- C2 is ""event6 or C1"", i.e. ""event6 or event4 or event3"".
- The context states that initially event6 happened.
- Therefore ""event6"" is true, so ""event6 or event4 or event3"" is true regardless of what else happens.

Thus C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses:
- C1 = (event4 happens) OR (event3 happens).
- C2 = (event6 happens) OR C1, i.e. C2 ≡ (event6) OR (event4) OR (event3).

Step 2 — use the context:
The context explicitly states ""Initially, event6 happened."" That means ""event6 happens"" is true in the given situation.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
Since event6 is true, (event6) OR (event4) OR (event3) is true, so C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 has happened (given).
- After event3, one of {event2, event5, event7} must happen. Choose event2.
- After event2, one of {event4, event6, event7} must happen. Choose event4.
- That yields a valid sequence containing both event3 and event4, so C1 (event3 and event4 happen) can be true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not necessarily true (it is false that C1 cannot hold).

Final: False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1 says “event3 happens and event4 happens.” C2 is the negation of that.
- The context states initially event3 happened, so event3 does occur.
- From event3 the allowed next events are {event2, event5, event7}. Pick event2.
- From event2 the allowed next events are {event4, event6, event7}. Pick event4.
- That yields a valid sequence 3 → 2 → 4 in which both event3 and event4 occur, so C1 can be true.
- Since C1 is possible, C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is not true.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happens, so the first part of C1 (""event3 happens"") holds.
- From event3 the rules allow next event ∈ {event2, event5, event7}.
- There exist continuations that produce event4 (for example: 3 → 2 → 4), so C1 can hold.
- There also exist continuations that avoid event4 forever (for example the cycle 3 → 2 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 6 …), so C1 is not guaranteed.
- Because C1 is not entailed (neither forced true nor forced false), the claim ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not entailed either.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 is ""Event4 happens in the next state.""

Step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules state: ""After event1, either event6, or event7 must happen."" (repeated several times, but consistently the same.)
- There is no rule allowing event4 immediately after event1.
- Therefore event4 cannot be the next event.

So C1 is false, hence C2 (the negation) is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- From the context: the initial event is event1. The rule ""After event1, either event6 or event7 must happen"" restricts the immediate next state to only event6 or event7.
- Since event4 is not among the allowed next events after event1, event4 cannot occur in the next state. Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event4 does not happen next).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules include: ""After event1, either event6, or event7 must happen."" No rule allows event4 directly after event1.

Step 3 — trace reasoning:
- From the initial event1, the next state must be event6 or event7.
- Therefore event4 cannot be the next event.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 simplifies to ""event5 happens"" (since ""event5 or event5"" is just event5).
- C2 is the negation: ""event5 does not happen.""
- From the context: initially event1 happens and ""after event1, either event4 or event5 must happen."" So there is a valid continuation where event5 does occur (choose event5 immediately).
- Because the context allows a trace where event5 happens, C1 can be true, so C2 (""event5 does not happen"") is not entailed.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 is simply ""Event5 happens"" (it's ""event5 or event5"").
- C2 is the negation: ""Event5 does not happen.""
- From the context, starting at event1 you may go to event5 immediately (1 -> 5), so C1 can be true.
- But you can also avoid event5 indefinitely by choosing 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 ... (all allowed transitions), so C1 can be false.
- Because both possibilities exist, C2 (""event5 does not happen"") is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is not true.
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 simplifies to ""Event5 happens.""
- Start at event1. From 1 you can go to 4 (or 5).
- From 4 you can go to 6 (or 5,7).
- From 6 you can go back to 1 (or 2,7).
- Thus there is a cycle 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 that never visits event5.
- Because a valid sequence exists that avoids event5, C1 does not hold, so C2 is True."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true, where C1 is ""Event6 does not happen.""

1. Initially, event6 happened.
2. The transition rule after event6 is: the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}. (Repeated lines don’t change this.)
3. None of those possible next events is event6, so it is impossible for event6 to occur in the immediate next state.
4. Therefore C1 (event6 does not happen) is true in the next state.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event6 does not happen"" (i.e., event6 is false in a state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — so: in the state immediately after the initial one, event6 does not happen.

Step 2 — use the rules and the initial condition:
- Initially, event6 happened.
- The rule ""After event6, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen"" means the next state after the initial state must be one of event1, event2, or event3.

Step 3 — check whether event6 can occur in that next state:
- None of {event1, event2, event3} is event6, so event6 does not occur in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:

False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens. From event3 one possible next event is event4, so C1 (event6 or event4 happens) can be made true (e.g., 3 -> 4).
- But it's also possible to avoid both event4 and event6 indefinitely. For example: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... never uses event4 or event6 (after event1 choose 5 or 7, and after 5 choose 1,2,3,or7; this cycle avoids 4 and 6).
- Because the premises do not force that neither 4 nor 6 occur (nor force that one of them must occur), C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not entailed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3 the allowed next events are {1,2,4,5,7}. To avoid event4 and event6, do not choose 4 or 1 (event6 can only occur after event1).
- Choose event2 after event3 (allowed). From event2 the allowed next events are {3,4,5,7}; choose event3 (avoiding 4).
- This yields a cycle 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 ... that never produces event4 or event1, hence never produces event6.
- Therefore it is possible that neither event4 nor event6 ever happens, so ""event6 or event4 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed. C2 asserts C1 does not hold as a definite fact; since C1 can be either true or false depending on choices, C2 is not entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the context / transitions
- Initially event2 happened.
- From event2 one may go to event3, event6, or event7.
- From event3 one may go to event1 (among others).

Step 3 — trace a concrete allowed sequence that makes C1 true
- Start: event2 (given) -> choose event3 (allowed) -> then choose event1 (allowed after event3).
- So event1 can happen in a valid sequence.

Conclusion
- Since event1 can occur, C1 is satisfiable, so C2 (""event1 does not happen"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 is simply ""Event1 happens"" (since ""Event1 or Event1"" is equivalent to Event1).
- From the context: initially event2 happens. After event2, event3 is one allowed next event. After event3, event1 is an allowed next event.
- So a valid sequence is event2 -> event3 -> event1, which makes C1 true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
C1 simplifies to ""Event1 happens."" From the context: Initially event2. After event2, event3 is allowed; after event3, event1 is allowed. So there is a valid sequence 2 → 3 → 1 in which Event1 happens. Thus C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false: starting from the initial event3, one possible cycle is 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... which never includes event2, so event2 does not always occur.
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" For C2 to be true, every time event2 occurs it must be the case that event2 always happens. But there is a reachable trace showing this fails: 3 -> 1 -> 2, and from event2 we can next go to event1 (or 3,4,5,6). So event2 can occur and yet it is not the case that event2 always happens afterward.
- Therefore C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — what C2 asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., event2 occurs at all times / in every step).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" In other words, whenever event2 occurs at some point, from then on event2 must always occur.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules relevant to event2
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen (so event1 can lead to event2).
- After event2: either event1, event3, event4, event5, or event6 must happen — event2 is NOT among the immediate successors of event2.
- Initially we start at event3, and from event3 we can go to event1, event5, or event7.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample trace
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose event1 next (allowed from event3).
- Then choose event2 (allowed from event1). So event2 has happened.
- But after that, choose event1 (allowed successor of event2). Now the current event is event1, not event2 — so event2 is not happening at this step.

Thus event2 occurred but it is not the case that event2 happens at every step afterward. That violates C1, so the implication in C2 fails.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event3 happens initially.
- Show C1 is false: there is a possible infinite trace that never hits event2, e.g. 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 ... (from 3 you may go to 7, from 7 to 1, from 1 to 3, and repeat). So event2 does not always happen, hence C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false.
- Show the antecedent of C2 can be true: there is a trace where event2 does occur, e.g. 3 -> 1 -> 2 (from 3 to 1, from 1 to 2).
- So there exists a run where event2 happens while C1 is false; therefore the implication ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is false.

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- Start with event7. Choose after event7 -> event6.
- After event6 choose event3.
- After event3 choose event6 again.
- Repeat 6 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3 ... indefinitely.

In this execution event3 does happen but event2 never does, so C1 (""if event3 then event2"") is false, and event2 does not happen either. Thus the disjunction C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds"") is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event7 (given).
- From 7 we can choose 6 (7 -> 6).
- From 6 we can choose 3 (6 -> 3).
- From 3 we can choose 6 again (3 -> 6).
- Repeating 6 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3 ... gives an infinite execution where event3 occurs repeatedly but event1 (and hence event2) is never chosen, so event2 never happens.

This execution falsifies C1 (because event3 happens but event2 does not), and also makes ""event2 happens"" false. Therefore the disjunction C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds"") is false.
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") follows from the rules. Reasoning:

- C1 is the claim: if event3 happens then event2 happens (3 -> 2).
- To show C1 false it suffices to exhibit one valid execution where 3 happens but 2 never happens.

Construct a valid run from the rules:
- Initially 7.
- From 7 choose 6 (allowed).
- From 6 choose 3 (allowed). Now 3 has happened.
- From 3 choose 4 (allowed).
- From 4 choose 5 (allowed).
- From 5 choose 3 (allowed).
This yields the cycle 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> ... and so on, in which event2 never occurs. Thus C1 is false (there is an execution where 3 occurs but 2 does not).

Since C1 is false and there exists a valid execution in which event2 does not happen, the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step brief):
- Initially event6 happens. After event6 we may choose event2.
- After event2 we may choose event4 (avoiding event3).
- After event4 event1 must happen.
- After event1 we may choose event2 again.

This gives the infinite valid cycle 6 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → ... which includes event2 and never includes event3. That makes C1 (""event2 does not happen"") false and event3 false, so C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is false.
---
We need to check whether (not Event2) OR Event3 must hold in all allowed sequences starting from the initial event6.

Counterexample (allowed by the rules):
- Start: event6 (given).
- After event6 choose event2 (allowed).
  - Now Event2 has happened, so ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- After event2 choose event6 (allowed).
- Repeat 2 → 6 → 2 → 6 ... forever, always choosing transitions that avoid event3.

This trace is permitted by the rules, contains Event2, and never contains Event3, so both disjuncts of C2 are false in this trace. Thus C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start with event6 (given). From event6 we can go to event2.
- From event2 we can go to event4; from event4 we must go to event1; from event1 we can return to event2 (choices include 2). This yields the cycle 6 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → ...
- In this infinite trace event2 does occur (so C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" is false) and event3 never occurs.
- Therefore C2 (""Event2 does not happen OR event3 happens"") is false in this possible sequence. Hence C2 is not guaranteed by the premises."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- From the context, initial event is 7. Possible transitions (condensed): 
  - After 7: {1,5,6}
  - After 6: {1,2,3}
  - After 2: {1,3,4}
  - After 4: {2,5,6,7}
  - (others exist but not needed)
- Construct a valid sequence avoiding event3 while including events 4 and 6:
  - 7 -> 6 (choose 6 from after 7)
  - 6 -> 2 (choose 2 from after 6, avoid 3)
  - 2 -> 4 (choose 4 from after 2)
  - 4 -> 6 (choose 6 from after 4)
  - Now we have both event4 and event6, and we can repeat 6 -> 2 -> 4 indefinitely without ever taking a transition to event3.
- Thus there is a valid sequence where C1 (event4 and event6 happen) holds but event3 never happens. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether ""If event4 and event6 both happen (C1), then event3 happens"" is forced by the rules.

Key transitions (extracted from the context):
- start: event7
- 7 -> {1,5,6}
- 6 -> {1,2,3}
- 2 -> {1,3,4}
- 4 -> {2,5,6,7}
(others exist but these are the ones used below)

Counterexample trace avoiding event3:
- Start at 7.
- 7 -> 6 (so event6 happens).
- 6 -> 2 (choose 2, avoid 3).
- 2 -> 4 (choose 4, avoid 3).

At this point both event4 and event6 have occurred (C1 holds), and event3 has not occurred. From 4 we can continue 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4 ... indefinitely, never taking any transition that produces event3 (all chosen transitions avoid 3). Thus event3 is not forced by the rules whenever 4 and 6 both occur.

Therefore C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event7 happened.
- From event7 we can choose event6 (allowed: {1,5,6}).
- From event6 we can choose event2 (allowed: {1,2,3}) — avoid 3.
- From event2 we can choose event4 (allowed: {1,3,4}) — avoid 3.
- So the sequence 7 → 6 → 2 → 4 contains both event6 and event4 (C1 true) but never contains event3.
- Moreover, from 4 we can go to 6 (4 → 6) and then back to 2 → 4, forming a loop {4,6,2} that never requires event3.

Thus there is a valid execution in which C1 holds and event3 does not occur, so ""If C1 holds then event3 happens"" is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""(event7 happens) AND (event2 happens)"".
- C2 asserts ""If C1 then event7 happens"".
- From the conjunction in C1, event7 is directly one of the conjuncts. So whenever C1 holds, event7 holds.
- Therefore the implication ""if C1 then event7"" is true (indeed it's trivially true by conjunction elimination).
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event7 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., Event7 ∧ Event2).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"" (i.e., (Event7 ∧ Event2) → Event7).

Step 2 — logical reasoning:
- From C1 we already have Event7 as part of the conjunct (Event7 ∧ Event2). So the consequent of C2 is directly contained in the antecedent.
- Therefore the implication (Event7 ∧ Event2) → Event7 is always true (it is a basic logical tautology: A ∧ B → A).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the forms:
- C1 is the statement ""Event7 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., C1 = event7 ∧ event2).
- C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"" (i.e., C1 → event7).

Step 2 — logical check:
- From propositional logic, (event7 ∧ event2) → event7 is a tautology: whenever the conjunction holds, its conjunct event7 is true.

The transition facts about events are irrelevant to this logical implication.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event3 nor event5 ever happens) follows from the rules.

1. Initially event7 happened. From event7 the next event must be either event1 or event3.
2. If we pick event3 immediately (7 → 3), then event3 happens, so C1 (event3 or event5 happens) is true in that run. Therefore ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false for that possibility.
3. Although there are runs that avoid both 3 and 5 indefinitely (for example 7 → 1 → 6 → 4 → 1 → 6 → ... choosing the non-3/non-5 options), the existence of at least one run where event3 occurs means C1 is not universally false.
4. C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., C1 is false). Because there is a valid sequence where C1 is true, C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:

- Initially event7 occurs.
- After event7 we may choose event1 (the rule allows event1 or event3).
- After event1 we may choose event6 (the rule allows event3, event5, or event6).
- After event6 we may choose event4 (the rule allows event1, event3, or event4).
- After event4 we may choose event6 (the rule allows event1 or event6).

Thus we can follow the infinite cycle 7 → 1 → 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 → ... and never trigger event3 or event5. That shows a valid sequence where C1 (""event3 or event5 happens"") does not hold. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) can be true.

True
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event7 occurs. After event7 either event1 or event3 must occur.
- If event3 occurs immediately, then C1 (event3 or event5) holds, so C2 (its negation) is false.
- If event1 occurs, its successors are {event3, event5, event6}. One can choose event6 to avoid 3 and 5. From event6 one can choose event4 or event1 (both avoid 3/5), and from event4 one can choose event1 or event6. Thus there is a looping trace 7 → 1 → 6 → 4 → 1 ... that never produces event3 or event5.
- Because there exist traces where C1 holds and traces where C1 does not hold, C2 is not entailed by the rules. The statement ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore not guaranteed — so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- The hypothesis C1 asserts ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- The context states the initial event is event3 and ""After event3, either event2, or event7 must happen."" That gives the only allowed immediate successors of event3: event2 or event7.
- Event5 is not one of those allowed successors, so Event5 cannot occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false, and its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event5 does not happen in the next state"").

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the next event must be either event2 or event7 (no other option).

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- Since the only possible next events after event3 are event2 or event7, event5 cannot be the next event.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, so C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event5 does not happen next).

Step 2 — Examine the initial condition and transition rules:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule after event3: the next state must be either event2 or event7. (No rule allows event5 immediately after event3.)

Step 3 — Reasoning about the next state:
- Because the next state after event3 is restricted to {event2, event7}, Event5 cannot be the next state.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C1 and C2:
- C1 is false (Event5 does not happen next).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Votes: {'True': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 means “event2 does not happen.”
- C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) asks whether there is an execution from the initial situation after which event2 never occurs (i.e. we can reach a behavior where event2 is avoided forever).

From the initial event5, the allowed successors are {event2, event7}. To avoid event2, pick event7.
- 5 -> 7 (allowed)
From 7 the allowed successors are {event1, event2, event6}. Again avoid event2 by picking event1.
- 7 -> 1 (allowed)
From 1 the successors are {event4, event6}. Pick event6.
- 1 -> 6 (allowed)
From 6 the successors are {event1, event5, event7}. Pick event1 again.
- 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> 6 ... 

Thus there is a cycle 1 <-> 6 that contains no event2. Once the run enters that cycle (via 5,7,1,6), event2 never occurs again. Therefore C1 can hold eventually (indeed from the start of the cycle onward), so C2 is True.

- C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false because the next state is event3, not event4.

- C1 claims event4 happens in the next state — that is false because the next event is event3, not event4.
- C2 is ""event5 happens or C1 holds."" In the next state neither event5 nor event4 occur (event3 does), so both disjuncts are false.

Therefore C2 is False.

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e., at some point event2 or event1 occurs).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event6 happens"" (i.e., whenever event1 or event2 occurs, event6 must eventually occur).

We must decide whether C2 is forced by the given transition rules.

- 2 -> {1,4,5,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,5,7} (initially event3)

Start at the initial event3, choose:
- 3 -> 2 (allowed),
- 2 -> 1 (allowed),
- 1 -> 2 (allowed),
and repeat 2 -> 1 -> 2 indefinitely.

This infinite trace is consistent with all rules, contains event2 (so C1 holds), and never visits event6 (we never choose 7 -> 6). Because such a valid execution exists where C1 is true but event6 never occurs, C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
Summary of hypothesis:
- C1: event2 or event1 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event6 happens.

We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given transition rules.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Start: event3 has happened (given).
2. From event3, one allowed next event is event1 (rule: after event3 → 1,2,5,7).
3. From event1, one allowed next event is event2 (rule: after event1 → 2 or 3).
4. From event2, one allowed next event is event1 (rule: after event2 → 1,4,5,7).
5. Thus there is a valid infinite loop: ... event3, event1, event2, event1, event2, ... This execution satisfies C1 (event1 and event2 occur) but never visits event7, and therefore never can reach event6 (event6 is only reachable from event7).

Since we have a valid execution where C1 holds but event6 does not happen, C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — restate rules (relevant transitions)
- Start: event3.
- 3 → {1, 2, 5, 7}
- 1 → {2, 3}
- 2 → {1, 4, 5, 7}
- 5 → {2, 7}
- 7 → {5, 6}
- 4 → {2}
- 6 → {2, 4, 7}

Step 2 — interpret hypothesis
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e., at some point in a run).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event6 happens"" — i.e., whenever a run contains event1 or event2, that run necessarily contains event6 later.

Step 3 — find counterexamples
- Counterexample using event1: take 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... forever (choose 1→3 and 3→1 repeatedly). C1 holds (event1 occurs) but event6 never occurs.
- Counterexample using event2: take 3 → 2 → 5 → 2 → 5 → ... (cycle between 2 and 5). C1 holds (event2 occurs) but event6 never occurs.

Because there exist runs where C1 is true but event6 never happens, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
C2 states: ""If (event5 and event6), then event5."" That's a logical tautology: any conjunction A and B implies A. The given context about event sequences is irrelevant to this logical implication. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning: C1 is ""event5 and event6"". From that conjunction, event5 follows directly (conjunction elimination). So the implication ""if C1 then event5"" is always true.
---
Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""event5 happens and event6 happens"" (i.e., event5 ∧ event6).
- C2 asserts ""if C1 holds, then event5 happens"" (i.e., (event5 ∧ event6) → event5).
- In propositional logic, (P ∧ Q) → P is always true (a tautology): if both P and Q hold, then P certainly holds.

Therefore C2 is True.

Sample responses:
C1: ""Event7 does not happen.""  
C2: ""C1 holds or event7 happens"" = (not Event7) OR Event7.

From the context, event7 did happen initially, so Event7 is true, hence C1 is false. But C2 is (False) OR (True) = True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event7 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event7 happens."" So C2 is (not event7) OR event7.

Step 2 — use context:
- The context states ""Initially, event7 happened."" Therefore event7 does happen, so C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 = (C1) OR (event7). With C1 false but event7 true, C2 is true.
- (Also note (¬E7) ∨ E7 is a tautology, always true.)

Answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event7 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event7 happens"" i.e. (Event7 does not happen) OR (Event7 happens).

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- The context starts with ""Initially, event7 happened."" So ""event7 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C1 is false (since event7 does happen).
- C2 = false OR true = true.

Sample responses:
We want to know whether ""If event1 and event2 happen, then event7 happens"" is necessarily true given the rules.

Key rules (condensed):
- Initially event6 happens.
- After event6 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → event5 must happen.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event2, event3, event6} must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4, event5, event6} must happen.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event7} must happen.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event6, event7} must happen.
- After event7 → one of {event1, event4, event6} must happen.

Construct a valid sequence that produces event1 and event2 but never forces event7:
- Initially event6 (given).
- After event6 → event1 (forced).
- After event1 → event5 (forced).
- After event5 choose event2 (allowed).
Now event1 and event2 have both occurred. After event2 we may choose event1 (allowed), and then the pattern repeats: event1 → event5 → event2 → event1 → ... This cycle never requires event7, so event7 need not occur.

Because there is a valid sequence where both event1 and event2 happen but event7 does not, the implication ""if event1 and event2 then event7"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Counterexample (valid sequence under the rules where C1 holds but 7 never occurs):

- Initially 6 happens.
- After 6, 1 must happen → sequence: 6, 1.
- After 1, 5 must happen → 6, 1, 5.
- From 5 choose 2 → 6, 1, 5, 2. (Now both event1 and event2 have occurred, so C1 holds.)
- From 2 choose 1 (allowed), then 5 (forced), then 6 (choose from 5), then 1 (forced), then 5, then 6, ... and so on.

This infinite cycle 6 → 1 → 5 → 6 ... never includes event7, so C1 can hold without event7 ever happening. Therefore C2 is False.
---
We want to know whether ""If event1 and event2 happen, then event7 must happen"" is guaranteed by the rules.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event6 happens.
- From ""After event6, event1 must happen"" we get event1.
- From ""After event1, event5 must happen"" we get event5.
- From ""After event5, either event1, event2, event3, or event6 must happen"" we may choose event2. Now event1 and event2 both have happened (C1 holds).
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4, event5, event6} must happen. We can choose event1 (or event5 or event6) again.
- Choosing event1 leads to event5 again, and we can repeatedly pick transitions that avoid event7 (for example loop: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 ...), never forcing event7.

Because there is a valid sequence where event1 and event2 occur but event7 never occurs, C2 (""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
The hypothesis C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then event4 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 ⇒ ¬event4).

From the rules:
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, event2 is allowed.
- After event2, event4 is allowed.

So there is a valid sequence: event5 → event2 → event4, in which event2 occurs and event4 also occurs. That is a counterexample to C2.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 does not happen (i.e., event4 never occurs).
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., whenever event2 happens, event4 does not happen).

Step 2 — Examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event5 occurred.
- From event5, one allowed next event is event2 (also event4 is allowed).
- From event2, one allowed next event is event4 (among others).

Step 3 — Find a counterexample to C2:
- Take the sequence: event5 → event2 → event4.
- This is allowed by the rules (5 permits 2; 2 permits 4). In this run event2 happens and event4 also happens, so C1 is false in that run, and thus the implication in C2 fails.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: Event4 does not happen.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., event2 → not event4).
We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the given transition rules starting from initial event5.

Step 2 — relevant transitions (extracted from the context)
- Initial: event5 happens.
- After event5 → {1,2,3,4,6,7}.
- After event2 → {1,4,6,7}.
(Other transitions exist but these two are sufficient.)

Step 3 — construct a counterexample
- From the initial event5 we can choose event2 (since 5 → 2 is allowed).
- After event2 we can choose event4 (since 2 → 4 is allowed).
So there is a valid sequence: 5 then 2 then 4. In that sequence event2 happens and event4 also happens.

Conclusion
- Because there exists a valid sequence where event2 occurs and event4 also occurs, the implication ""if event2 happens then event4 does not happen"" is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to check C2: ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event4 happens and event5 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to: whenever event5 occurs, event4 also occurs (since event5 occurring implies event5).

We can refute this by giving a valid sequence (following the ""after X"" rules) where event5 occurs but event4 never occurs. Starting from the initial event6:

- 6 -> 5 (allowed: after event6, event5 may happen) so event5 has happened.
- 5 -> 1 (allowed: after event5, event1 may happen).
- 1 -> 5 (allowed: after event1, event5 may happen).

This yields the infinite loop 6,5,1,5,1,5,... in which event5 occurs (in fact repeatedly) but event4 never occurs. Hence it is not true that event5 implies event4 happens.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 says: if event5 happens then C1 holds. C1 requires both event5 and event4 to occur.
- So C2 effectively requires that whenever event5 occurs, event4 must also occur (at some point).
- From the rules and the initial event6, there is a valid sequence that contains event5 but never contains event4:
  - Start with event6 (given), choose event5 next (6 → 5).
  - From 5 choose event1 (5 → 1).
  - From 1 choose event2 (1 → 2).
  - From 2 must go to event3 (2 → 3).
  - From 3 choose event1 again (3 → 1), and this loop 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 can repeat indefinitely without ever taking event4.
- Thus event5 can occur without event4 ever occurring, so C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Start: event6 happens (given).
- From event6 we can have event5 next.
- From event5 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event5 (allowed).
- Repeat 5 → 1 → 5 indefinitely.

In that run event5 occurs but event4 never occurs, so C1 (event4 and event5 happen) does not hold. Therefore the implication ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed, so C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event6 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" (i.e. either event6 happens next, or event5 happens next)

Step 2 — constraints from the context
- Initially event5 happened (current state).
- The rule after event5: the next state must be either event2 or event3.

Step 3 — evaluate the disjunction in C2 for the next state
- From the rule, the next state cannot be event6, so C1 is false.
- The next state also cannot be event5 (it must be event2 or event3), so ""event5 happens"" is false for the next state.
- Both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurred.
- The rule for after event5 says the next state must be either event2 or event3. So the immediate next state is event2 or event3 (not event5).
- C1 asserts ""event6 happens in the next state."" Neither event2 nor event3 is event6, and no rule allows event6 immediately after event5. So C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens"" (in the next state). Since C1 is false and event5 does not happen in the next state, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- We interpret both C1 and the ""event5 happens"" part of C2 as statements about the next state after the initial state.
- From the context: initially event5 happened. After event5, the next event must be either event2 or event3. Event6 is not allowed immediately after event5, so C1 (""Event6 happens in the next state"") is false.
- Also, event5 cannot occur in that next state (the next state must be event2 or event3, not event5). Therefore the ""event5 happens"" disjunct of C2 is also false.
- Since both disjuncts are false, C2 (""C1 holds or event5 happens"") is false."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false. C1 asserts ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible sequence starting from the initial event7, event3 will occur). So we must check if every allowed path starting at 7 necessarily hits event3.

From the given transitions:
- 7 -> {2,4,5,6}
- 4 -> {5,7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,4}
- 2 -> {1,3,4,7}
- 6 -> {1,3,4,7}
- 1 -> {2,5,7}
- 3 -> {7}

A counterexample path that never visits event3 is:
7 -> 4 -> 7 -> 4 -> 7 -> 4 -> ...
This alternation is allowed because 7 can go to 4 and 4 can go to 7, and it never enters 2,5, or 6 (the states that have transitions to 3). Therefore event3 does not necessarily occur on all possible runs.

Thus C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 states ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., every valid sequence from the initial event7 must at some point include event3).

From the transition rules:
- 7 -> {2,4,5,6}
- 4 -> {5,7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,4}
…etc.

There is a valid infinite path that never visits event3: choose 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> ... . All transitions used are allowed (4 -> 5 and 5 -> 4), and event3 is never reached on this path. Thus event3 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible sequence, so C1 is false.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True. Final answer: True.

- C1: Event3 always happens (i.e., in every possible run from the initial event7, event3 occurs).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., there is at least one run where event3 never occurs).

Step 2 — examine transitions (summarized):
- 7 -> {2,4,5,6}
- 2 -> {1,3,4,7}
- 4 -> {5,7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,4}
- 6 -> {1,3,4,7}
- 1 -> {2,5,7}
- 3 -> {7}

Step 3 — look for a run that avoids event3:
- From 7 choose 4 (allowed).
- From 4 choose 5 (allowed).
- From 5 choose 4 (allowed).
Thus we have the infinite cycle 7 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ... which never visits event3.

Step 4 — conclude:
- Since there exists a run that never includes event3, C1 is false and C2 (the negation) is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:

---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate successor is event2).
- The rules say: ""After event7, either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen."" That makes event2 one possible successor of event7 but not the only one.
- Therefore, event7 does not guarantee event2 next (it could be event1, event4, or event5). So the implication ""if event7 happens, then event2 happens next"" is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e. whenever event7 occurs, the next event must be event2).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (relevant ones):
- After event7, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- The choices are nondeterministic (""either ... must happen""), so any of those successors is allowed.
- From the initial event2, event7 is reachable (e.g. event2 -> event3 -> event1 -> event7 is allowed).

Step 3 — produce a counterexample:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Choose next: event3 (allowed after event2).
- Then choose: event1 (allowed after event3).
- Then choose: event7 (allowed after event1).
- After event7, choose event1 (allowed successor of event7). This successor is not event2, so C1 is false in this occurrence of event7.

Conclusion: C2 is false (there exists an allowed trace where event7 is followed by something other than event2).

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Summarize transitions (duplicates collapsed):
  - after 2 → {1,3,4,6,7}
  - after 1 → {3,4}
  - after 3 → {2,4,5,6,7}
  - after 4 → {1,3,5}
  - after 6 → {1,2,4,5,7}
  - after 7 → {1,3,5}
  - after 5 → {1,3,4,6}
- Initially event7 happened. So the immediate next state must be one of {event1, event3, event5} (because after 7 → {1,3,5}).
- C1 is the proposition ""if event7 happens, then event4 happens"" (an implication evaluated in a state).
- In any next-state candidate (event1, event3, or event5), event7 does not happen. An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Therefore C1 is true in every possible next state, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning summary:
- C1 is the implication ""If event7 happens, then event4 happens.""
- Initially event7 happened, so the next state must be one of event1, event3, or event5 (since after event7 only 1, 3, or 5 can occur).
- In that next state event7 does not happen, so the antecedent of C1 is false there; thus C1 is vacuously true in the next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The rules say: ""After event7, either event1, event3, or event5 must happen."" They do not include event4.
- C1 claims: If event7 happens, then event4 happens. That contradicts the given rule, so C1 is false in the current state.
- C2 claims that C1 holds in the next state. The transition rules are the same in every state, so after any occurrence of event7 the allowed next events remain {event1, event3, event5}, not event4. Thus C1 is also false in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happens.
- After event7, event6 must happen. So we have 7 → 6.
- After event6, one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen. Choose event1. So we have 7 → 6 → 1 (this choice is allowed by the rules).
- After event1, event2 must happen. So we have 7 → 6 → 1 → 2, hence both event1 and event2 occur.
- Therefore C1 (event1 and event2 happen) can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happens.
- After event7, event6 must happen → we have event6.
- After event6, one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen. Choose event1 (this is allowed).
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 occurs.
- Thus both event1 and event2 happen, so C1 holds in a valid sequence.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"", which is therefore false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happens, so event6 must happen next.
- From event6 we can choose among {event1, event3, event4, event5}.
- It is possible to avoid event1 (and therefore event2) by choosing event5, then event7, then event6 again, and so on (7 → 6 → 5 → 7 → 6 …). This never forces event1 or event2, so C1 need not hold.
- Conversely, it is also possible to make C1 true by choosing 6 → 1 → 2 (event1 then event2).
Thus C1 is not forced false, nor is it forced true; C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not entailed by the context. Therefore the statement ""C2 is True"" is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- From the context: after event1, event6 is one allowed next event. After event6, event5 is explicitly one allowed next event.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence: event1 → event6 → event5 (and then event4, etc.) that satisfies all given rules.
- That sequence shows event6 can occur and event5 can also occur afterward, so ""if event6 happens, then event5 does not happen"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:
- We start with event1.
- From event1 one allowed next event is event6 (rule: after event1, either event4, event5, or event6 must happen). So a sequence 1 -> 6 is permitted.
- From event6 one allowed next event is event5 (rule: after event6, either event2, event3, event4, or event5 must happen). So the continuation 1 -> 6 -> 5 is permitted.
- That produces a valid timeline in which event6 happens and event5 also happens. This is a counterexample to ""If event6 happens, then event5 does not happen.""

Therefore C2 is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""If event6 happens, then C1 holds"", i.e. ""if event6 happens then event5 does not happen"") is true given the rules.

Key transitions (summarized):
- initial: event1 happens.
- 1 -> {4, 5, 6}
- 6 -> {2, 3, 4, 5}
- 5 -> {4}
- (others not needed for the counterexample)

Counterexample (allowed by the rules):
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1 choose event6 (allowed: 1 -> 6).
- After event6 choose event5 (allowed: 6 -> 5).

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning: From the rules, start at event1. You can choose event5 (after event1 → {event2, event5}). From event5 you can choose event1 (after event5 → {event1, event6, event7}). Repeating event1 → event5 → event1 ... yields an infinite execution that never visits event2, event6, or event3. Thus event3 is not guaranteed to occur in all runs, so ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) does not hold; therefore C2 is True.

True

Reasoning: Start at event1 (given). From event1 you may choose event5. From event5 you may choose event1. Repeating 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 ... is a valid infinite sequence that never includes event3. Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to occur in all executions, so ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1 we may choose event5 (rule: after event1, either event2 or event5 must happen).
- After event5 we may choose event1 (rule: after event5, either event1, event6, or event7 must happen).
- Repeating event1 -> event5 -> event1 indefinitely never forces event3 to occur.

Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to always happen (C1 is false), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event4 happened.
- From event4 we may choose event7 (allowed: after event4 → {3,6,7}).
- From event7 choose event1 (allowed: after event7 → {1,4,5}).
- From event1 choose event5 (allowed: after event1 → {3,5,7}).
- From event5 choose event2 (allowed: after event5 → {2,3}).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed: after event2 → {1,3,5,7}).

This gives a cycle 1 → 5 → 2 → 1 that can repeat indefinitely, and the initial choice 4 → 7 starts it. In this infinite execution neither event3 nor event6 ever occurs. Therefore ""Event3 happens or event6 happens"" (C1) does not necessarily hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

True

Reasoning in brief:
- C1 asserts ""event3 happens or event5 happens."" The context explicitly states ""Initially, event5 happened,"" so C1 is already true in every allowed scenario.
- C2 is ""if event6 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true regardless of whether event6 occurs, the implication is always satisfied.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- We start at event5 (given).
- From event5, one allowed next event is event6 (so event6 can happen).
- From event6, one allowed next event is event1.
- From event1, one allowed next event is event2.
- From event2, one allowed next event is event1.
- Thus there is an allowed infinite cycle 6 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... that never includes event3 or event5.

Because there exists an allowed continuation after event6 that avoids both event3 and event5 forever, the implication ""if event6 happens, then (event3 or event5 happens)"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happens.
- After event6, event3 must happen. So event3 happens.
- After event3, one of {event1, event5, event6} must happen. Choose event5.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2, event6} must happen. Choose event6.
- That returns to event6 → event3 → event5 → event6, etc. This yields a valid infinite loop in which event5 does occur but event2 never occurs (we always choose event6 after event5 rather than event1 or event2).
- Hence there is a model where Event5 happens and Event2 never happens, making C1 false and Event2 false; therefore C2 (Event2 or C1) can be false.

So C2 is False.
---
We ask whether ""C2: (Event2 happens) OR (Event5 does not happen)"" must be true given the rules and initial event6.

We can falsify C2 by exhibiting a valid event sequence in which Event5 does happen and Event2 never happens.

Start: event6 (given).
- After event6, event3 must happen (rule: after 6 → 3). So sequence: 6 → 3.
- After event3, one of {1,5,6} must happen. Choose event5. Sequence: 6 → 3 → 5.
- After event5, one of {1,2,6} must happen. To avoid event2, choose event6. Sequence: 6 → 3 → 5 → 6.
- After that event6 again forces event3, and we can repeat the same choices: 6 → 3 → 5 → 6 → 3 → 5 → ...

This loop is consistent with all the rules and produces event5 while never producing event2 (we always choose 6 after 5, and from 3 we choose 5 rather than 1, which would force 2). Thus there is a valid model where Event5 happens and Event2 does not.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed; the correct answer is: False.
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens or Event5 does not happen"") is necessarily true.

Key rules (condensed):
- Initially event6 happens.
- After 6, event3 must happen.
- After 3, one of {1, 5, 6} must happen.
- After 5, one of {1, 2, 6} must happen.
- After 1, 2 must happen.
- After 2, one of {3, 4, 6} must happen.
- (Other rules for 4 and 7 are present but not needed here.)

Construct a valid run that falsifies C2:
1. Start: 6 (given).
2. From 6 → 3 (mandatory).
3. From 3 → 5 (allowed choice).
4. From 5 → 6 (allowed choice; avoid 1 because 1 would force 2).
5. From 6 → 3 (mandatory), then repeat steps 3–4 as desired.

This produces a loop 6 → 3 → 5 → 6 → 3 → 5 ... in which event5 does occur but event2 never occurs. Thus C1 (Event5 does not happen) is false and Event2 does not happen, making C2 (""Event2 happens or Event5 does not happen"") false in this possible execution.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 is already true in the given scenario.
- C1 is the claim ""If event1 happens, then event6 happens."" Whether C1 holds or not does not affect the fact that event2 already happened.

Step 3 — conclude
- Because event2 has already happened, the conditional ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is true (the consequent is already true regardless of the premise).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event6 happens."" (a conditional)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" So we must decide whether (C1 → event2) is entailed by the given facts/rules.

Step 2 — examine given facts:
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" That is a plain fact: event2 is true.

Step 3 — logical consequence:
- An implication with a true consequent is always true (material implication): if event2 is already true, then (C1 → event2) holds regardless of whether C1 holds.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypotheses:
  - C1: If event1 happens, then event6 happens (i.e., event6 must follow event1).
  - C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.

- Examine the rules (transitions):
  - 1 -> {2,3,4,6}
  - 2 -> {4,5,7}
  - 3 -> 5
  - 4 -> {1,2,6,7}
  - 5 -> {3,7}
  - 6 -> {1,5,7}
  - 7 -> {3,4,6}
  - Initially, event2 happened.

- Is C1 true? No. From event1 you can go to event3, then 3->5, and 5->3, yielding an infinite 1->3->5->3... loop that never visits event6. So event6 is not forced after event1. Thus C1 is false.

- Is C2 true? Yes. C2 is the conditional ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" But event2 already happened initially, so the consequent (event2 happens) is true regardless of whether C1 holds. Therefore the implication C2 is true (and, independently, since C1 is false the implication would also be vacuously true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:

---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context, after event5 one possible next event is event7 (5 -> 7). So there exists a valid sequence in which event7 happens, making C1 (event4 or event7) true.
- C2 is the negation of C1. Because there is a valid trace where C1 holds, C2 cannot be concluded as true in general. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C2 says ""neither event4 nor event7 happens"" (i.e., the negation of C1).
- From the premises, after event5 one of {event1, event3, event6, event7} must occur.
- It is allowed that event7 occurs immediately after event5 (sequence 5 → 7), which makes C1 true in that model.
- Because there exists at least one valid sequence (model) where event7 happens, C2 (the claim that neither 4 nor 7 ever happens) is not guaranteed by the premises. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Counterexample from the given rules:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event1 may happen.
- After event1, event6 may happen.
- After event6, event3 may happen.

So the sequence 4 → 1 → 6 → 3 is allowed, meaning event3 can occur while event1 has occurred. That falsifies ""if event3 happens, then event1 does not happen"" (C2).
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4 one possible next event is event6 (rule: after event4 → {1,2,5,6,7}).
- From event6 one possible next event is event3 (rule: after event6 → {2,3}). So we can have 4 → 6 → 3, so event3 does happen.
- From event3 one possible next event is event2 (rule: after event3 → {2,5,6}).
- From event2 one possible next event is event1 (rule: after event2 → {1,6,7}). So we can continue 4 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 1, which includes both event3 and event1.

Since there exists a valid sequence consistent with the given rules in which event3 happens and event1 also happens, the statement ""If event3 happens, then event1 does not happen"" (C2) is false.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""If event3 happens, then event1 does not happen"") is entailed by the given rules.

Key rules needed:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, one of {1,2,5,6,7} must happen.
- After event6, one of {2,3} must happen.
- After event3, one of {2,5,6} must happen.
- After event2, one of {1,6,7} must happen.
(Other repeated rules are consistent with these.)

Find a counterexample sequence where event3 happens and event1 also happens:
- Start: 4 (given).
- From 4 → 6 (allowed).
- From 6 → 3 (allowed).
- From 3 → 2 (allowed).
- From 2 → 1 (allowed).

This yields a valid sequence 4 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 1 in which event3 and event1 both occur. That violates the conditional ""if event3 then event1 does not happen.""

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event5 happens in the next state."" So C2 asserts: whenever event1 occurs, the very next event must be event5.

Step 2 — relevant rule:
- The rules state: ""After event1, either event3, event4, or event6 must happen."" Event5 is not among the allowed next events after event1.

Step 3 — can the antecedent occur?
- Yes: initially event3 happened and after event3 one option is event1, so event1 can occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because event1 can occur and the rule forbids event5 as the next event after event1, the implication ""if event1 happens then event5 happens next"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning: After event3 the system may go to event1. But after event1 the rules allow event3, event4, or event6 next — none require event5 immediately. For example: event3 → event1 → event3 is a permitted trace, so event1 does not force event5 in the next state. Hence C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event5 must occur in the next state.
We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given transition rules.

Step 2 — examine the transitions
- After event3: next must be one of {event1, event2, event7}.
- After event1: next must be one of {event3, event4, event6}.
- After event2: next must be one of {event4, event5, event7}.
- After event7: next must be one of {event2, event6}.
- After event4: next must be event2.
- After event6: next must be one of {event1, event2, event5, event7}.
- After event5: next must be one of {event1, event3}.

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2
- Start: initially event3.
- Choose next = event1 (allowed after event3).
- After event1, the allowed next states are {event3, event4, event6}. None of these is event5. For example, take the next state = event3.
- So event1 can be followed by event3, not event5; thus event5 in the next state is not guaranteed when event1 happens.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

Sample responses:
False

Counterexample (one valid path from the rules) that makes C2 false:

- Start: event1.
- Choose event5 (allowed after event1).
- After event5 choose event4 (allowed; avoid event6).
- After event4 choose event1 (allowed; avoid event2 and event6).
- Loop: from event1 always choose event7, and from event7 choose event1 (these choices are allowed and avoid event2 and event6).

On this infinite path:
- event5 occurs but no event2 ever occurs afterward, so C1 (""if event5 then event2"") is false.
- event6 never occurs on the path, so ""event6 happens"" is false.

Therefore (C1) OR (event6 happens) is false on this path, so C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Hence C2 is False.
---
Reasoning:
- Transitions: 1 -> {5,7}; 5 -> {4,6}; 4 -> {1,2,6}; 6 -> {2,4}; 2 -> {5}; 3 -> {1}; 7 -> {1,2,3,6}.
- C1 asserts: every time 5 happens, 2 will happen later. This is false because there is a reachable cycle that contains 5 but never 2: 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... (always choosing 4 from 5 and 1 from 4), so 5 occurs yet 2 never occurs.
- Since C1 is not guaranteed, to make C2 true we would need event6 to be guaranteed. But the cycle above also avoids 6, so event6 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore neither disjunct of C2 is entailed by the rules, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

- After 4 choose 1 (avoid 2 and 6).

- After 7 choose 1 (or 3 -> 1), and repeat, always avoiding 2 and 6.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur in the next state after event3.
- The rule ""After event1, event5 must happen"" makes event5 occur one state later (after the state where event1 occurs).
- Therefore if event3 happens, event5 will occur two states later, not in the immediate next state. That means C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") does not follow from event3, so C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- After event3, the rule says event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1, the rule says event5 must happen (but that is the state after the next).
- Therefore if event3 happens, event5 happens two steps later, not in the immediate next state.
- C1 asserts event5 happens in the next state, so C1 does not follow immediately from event3. Hence C2 (""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- After event3, the rules require that event1 must happen in the next state.
- C1 requires event5 to happen in the next state.
- Event5 does not follow event3 directly; it follows event1 (i.e., event3 -> next: event1 -> following: event5).
- Therefore event5 is not guaranteed in the immediate next state after event3, so the conditional ""if event3 happens then C1 holds"" is false."

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypotheses:
- C1: If event6 happens, then event1 happens (i.e., starting from event6, event1 is inevitable).
- C2: If event7 happens, then C1 holds.

Examine the rules as a directed graph of allowed next events:
- 6 -> {2,3,4,5,7}
- 2 -> {3,6,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,5}
- 4 -> {7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,4,6,7}
- 7 -> {2,3,4,5}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,6,7}

Show C1 is false:
- From the initial event6 we can take 6 -> 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> ... forever. These transitions are allowed (2 -> 6 and 6 -> 2), and this infinite loop never reaches event1. Thus event1 is not inevitable after event6, so C1 is false.

Show C2 is false:
- C2 says “if event7 happens then C1 holds.” But since C1 is false, to falsify C2 we just need a valid sequence where event7 occurs while C1 is still false. For example: 6 -> 7 -> 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> ... is allowed (6 -> 7, 7 -> 2, 2 -> 6), contains event7, and never reaches event1. So event7 can occur while C1 is false, making C2 false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event6 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e., every time event6 occurs, event1 will eventually occur).
- C2: ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds."" So C2 says: whenever event7 occurs, it must be the case that every occurrence of event6 leads to event1.

Step 2 — relevant transition rules (compressed)
- Initially: event6.
- 6 -> {2,3,4,5,7}
- 2 -> {3,6,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,5}
- 4 -> {7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,4,6,7}
- 7 -> {2,3,4,5}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,6,7}

Step 3 — find a counterexample
- From the initial event6 we can go 6 -> 7 (allowed).
- From 7 go 7 -> 2 (allowed).
- From 2 go 2 -> 6 (allowed).
Now we have had event7 and later event6. From 6 we can repeat the cycle 6 -> 2 -> 6 -> 2 ... forever, and none of those states force event1. Thus there is a valid execution in which event7 happens, event6 happens afterward, and event1 never happens. That violates C1 in a run where event7 occurred, so C2 (which requires C1 to hold whenever event7 happens) is false.

Final answer: False

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 asserts that event3 or event4 occurs at some point. The context states “Initially, event4 happened.” So event4 already occurs in every possible run, hence C1 is true in all runs regardless of what happens later.

- C2 is the implication “If event5 happens, then C1 holds.” Since C1 is already true in every run (because of the initial event4), the implication is automatically true in every run (a true consequent makes the implication hold).

- (Note: it is possible after event5 to continue in a cycle that never reaches event3 or event4 again—for example 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 …—so event5 does not force a future occurrence of 3 or 4. That does not matter here because C1 was already satisfied at the start.)

Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event4 happens.""
- The context states initially event4 happened.
- Therefore C1 is already true (event4 has occurred).
- If C1 is already true, then any implication ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds"" is trivially true (the consequent is true regardless of whether the antecedent happens).
- Hence C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened, so ""event3 happens or event4 happens"" (C1) is already true.
- An implication ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds"" is true whenever the consequent (C1) is true, regardless of whether event5 actually occurs.
- Therefore C2 (""If event5 happens, then C1 holds"") is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., if C1 holds then in every execution/event sequence event2 occurs.
- Therefore, assuming C1, event2 does indeed happen (in every sequence, hence in particular).
- The statement ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is therefore true (it follows directly from the meaning of C1).
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning: C1 states that ""event2 always happens."" The conditional C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") follows directly from C1 by definition: assuming C1, event2 happens. (Even if C1 were false, the implication would be vacuously true.)
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (i.e., C1 → event2)

Step 2 — examine the meaning
- C1 asserts that event2 happens in all cases/times (a stronger claim).
- If C1 is true, then event2 happens (immediate from the meaning of ""always"").

Step 3 — conclusion
- C2 is logically true: whenever the antecedent (C1) holds, the consequent (event2 happens) follows. (Even if C1 were false, the implication C1 → event2 would still be true vacuously.)

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:

---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the rules: 3 -> {4,5}. If we choose 5, then 5 -> {6,7}. Choosing 7 yields the sequence 3 → 5 → 7, so event7 can happen.
- C1 asserts ""event7 or event2 happens."" That can be satisfied (e.g. by event7 above), so C1 is not ruled out.
- C2 is the negation of C1 (""neither event7 nor event2 happens""). Because there is a valid sequence where event7 does occur, C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning in steps:
- Initially event3 happens.
- From event3 you may choose event4 (3 -> 4).
- From event4 you may choose event7 (4 -> 7).
- Thus there is a valid sequence in which event7 happens, so C1 (""event7 happens or event2 happens"") can be true.
- C2 asserts the negation of C1 (that neither event7 nor event2 happens). Because there exists a reachable sequence where event7 does happen, C2 is not guaranteed and therefore is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: If event7 happens, then event5 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., given the context, C1 is true in all possible executions).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So event3 is terminal; the execution stops immediately after the initial event.)
- The other ""after"" rules only govern transitions if those events occur, but none can occur after the initial event3 because of the terminal constraint.

Step 3 — trace possible executions
- The only permitted execution is: event3 occurs, then nothing else.
- In no execution does event7 ever occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- An implication ""if event7 happens, then event5 happens"" is vacuously true in any execution where event7 never happens.
- Since event7 cannot occur in any permitted execution, C1 holds in all executions.
- Therefore C2 (that C1 always holds) is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 is the implication ""if event7 happens, then event5 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (in all executions).
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened"" and ""After event3, no other events can happen."" That fixes the only possible execution: event3 occurs and the run stops.
- Therefore event7 can never occur in any execution starting from the given initial condition.
- An implication ""if P then Q"" is vacuously true whenever P never holds. Since event7 never occurs, C1 is true in every execution.
- Hence C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens.
- The rules say that after event3, no other events can happen. Therefore no further events (including event7) can ever occur in any allowed execution.
- An implication ""if event7 happens, then event5 happens"" is vacuously true whenever event7 never occurs.
- Hence C1 holds in all possible executions, so C2 is True."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 asserts: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e. event3 => next event3).

From the rules: ""After event3, event1 must happen."" (stated explicitly twice). That is a must — the next event after event3 is event1, not event3.

Therefore event3 does not imply that event3 occurs in the next state. C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning: The rules say ""After event3, event1 must happen."" Therefore if event3 happens now, the next event cannot be event3 (it must be event1). So the implication ""if event3 happens, then event3 happens in the next state"" is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" This is a statement about a particular next-state occurrence (and from the context, starting at event1, event3 is one possible next event).
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreted: whenever event3 happens (in some state), then in the following state event3 happens.

From the context we have the rule: ""After event3, event1 must happen."" So if event3 occurs, the next state is event1, not event3. That directly falsifies the implication ""if event3 happens then event3 happens in the next state."" Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules, the only transition that leads to event7 is from event4 (after event4, one possible next event is event7). No other event has event7 as a successor.
- Therefore any occurrence of event7 must be immediately preceded by event4 — i.e., event4 must have happened before event7 can occur.
- If C1 holds (event7 happens), event4 must have occurred. Hence C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- The only rule that produces event7 is ""After event4, either event2, event3, or event7 must happen."" No rule allows event7 to occur except immediately following event4.
- Therefore any occurrence of event7 must be preceded by an occurrence of event4.
- If C1 holds (event7 always happens), then on every run there is a 7, and thus on every run there must have been a 4 earlier. Hence C2 is true.
---
True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1 says “Event7 always happens.” C2 asserts that if C1 holds, then event4 happens.
- Look at the transition rules that produce event7: the only rule that yields event7 is “After event4, either event2, event3, or event7 must happen.” No other rule ever produces event7.
- Therefore event7 cannot occur unless event4 occurred immediately before. So if event7 happens (and a fortiori if event7 always happens), event4 must have happened as a predecessor.
- Hence C2 is true."

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (Event2 happens) AND (Event1 happens).
- C2 = (Event3 happens) OR C1.

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context states “Initially, event3 happened.” So Event3 is true.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since Event3 happens, the disjunction in C2 is true regardless of C1.

Final answer: True

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event4 happens"" (event2 ∧ event4).
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" ( (event2 ∧ event4) → event2 ).

Step 2 — logical evaluation:
- In propositional logic, (P ∧ Q) → P is a tautology (conjunction elimination). So (event2 ∧ event4) → event2 is always true, regardless of the event rules or whether C1 actually holds.

Therefore: True
---
True

Reasoning: C1 asserts ""event2 happens and event4 happens."" The implication C2 is ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 already includes event2, the implication is trivially true: whenever C1 is true, event2 is necessarily true. The other event rules are irrelevant to this logical entailment.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event4 happens"" (event2 ∧ event4).
- C2 states ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — that is (event2 ∧ event4) → event2.
- By basic logic (conjunction elimination), from event2 ∧ event4 you can infer event2, so the implication is valid regardless of the surrounding event rules."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C1 is simply ""Event7 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant). C2 is ""Eventually, Event7 happens.""

Start: event6 has happened.
From event6: either event5 or event7 must happen.
- If event7 happens there, C1 holds immediately.
- If event5 happens, then event1 must happen (after event5), and after event1 event7 must happen. So event7 will occur in this branch as well.

All possible continuations from the initial event6 lead to event7, so C2 is True.

True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is simply ""Event7 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same literal).
- Initially event6 happened.
- The rule ""After event6, either event5 or event7 must happen"" gives two possible next events:
  - If event7 happens next, C1 holds immediately.
  - If event5 happens next, then ""After event5, event1 must happen"", and after that ""After event1, event7 must happen"". So the sequence 6 → 5 → 1 → 7 forces event7.
- In all possible continuations from the initial event6, event7 eventually occurs.

Therefore C2 (""event7 eventually holds"") is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is just ""event7 happens"" (redundantly written).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""event7 will eventually occur"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions and initial state
- Initially event6 happened.
- After event6, either event5 or event7 must happen.
- After event5, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event7 must happen.
- After event7, no other events can happen.
(Other rules are irrelevant for the initial-event6 branch.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state
- From event6 you can go directly to event7 → event7 occurs.
- Or from event6 you can go to event5 → then event1 (forced) → then event7 (forced).
- In both possible continuations from the initial event6, event7 occurs (possibly immediately, or after 5→1).

Conclusion
- Event7 is inevitable given the rules and initial event6, so ""event7 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the statements
- C1: ""Event6 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds."" Equivalently, C2 says: whenever event6 occurs, both event6 and event2 have occurred — so effectively it requires that event2 also occurs whenever event6 does.

Step 2 — use the context
- The context begins with: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 has already occurred in every possible sequence.

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- In any sequence where event6 happens, event6 is true by assumption, and event2 is already true because it happened initially. So both parts of C1 are satisfied whenever event6 occurs.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event6 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. event6 → (event6 ∧ event2), which is equivalent to event6 → event2.)

Step 2 — examine the context
- The problem states explicitly: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred (and nothing in the rules removes that fact).

Step 3 — reason about C2
- Because event2 already happened initially, any occurrence of event6 (now or later) will be accompanied by the fact that event2 happened. Thus whenever event6 happens, both event6 and event2 have occurred, so C1 is true.
- Therefore the implication ""if event6 happens then C1 holds"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — understand the statements
- C1: ""Event6 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds."" This is equivalent to: if event6 happens then event2 happens (since C1 already includes event6).

Step 2 — use the context
- The context says: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in every possible sequence, event2 has already occurred at the start.

Step 3 — evaluate the implication
- If event6 happens at any point in a sequence, event2 has already happened (because it happened initially). Therefore C1 (event6 happened and event2 happened) holds whenever event6 happens.
- Even if event6 never happens, the conditional is vacuously true.

Conclusion: C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether, given the event-transition rules starting from event1, the statement C2 (""event6 does not happen OR event7 happens"") must be true.

Construct the transition graph from the rules:
- 1 -> {4, 5, 7}
- 4 -> {1, 5, 7}
- 5 -> {2, 3, 4, 7}
- 2 -> {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- 3 -> {1, 4, 6, 7}
- 6 -> {2, 3, 5, 7}
- 7 -> {3, 4}

Find a counterexample path that avoids event7 but reaches event6:
1 -> 5 (allowed), 5 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 6 (allowed).
This sequence contains event6 and contains no event7. Thus C1 (""event6 does not happen"") is false in this possible execution, and ""event7 happens"" is also false, so C2 is false in that execution.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning: Start at event1. Choose event5 (allowed). From event5 choose event2 (allowed). From event2 choose event6 (allowed). This produces a sequence 1 → 5 → 2 → 6 that contains event6 and never contains event7. Thus C1 (""event6 does not happen"") is false and event7 does not happen, so C2 (""C1 holds or event7 happens"") is false.
---
Interpretation: C2 says ""(event6 does not happen) OR (event7 happens)"". To decide if C2 is guaranteed by the rules, we must check whether there exists any valid sequence (starting from event1) in which event6 happens and event7 never happens. If such a sequence exists, C2 is not always true.

Counterexample sequence (all transitions allowed by the rules, avoid event7):
- Start: event1 (given).
- From event1 → choose event5 (allowed: 4,5,7).
- From event5 → choose event2 (allowed: 2,3,4,7).
- From event2 → choose event6 (allowed: 1,3,4,5,6).

This sequence 1 → 5 → 2 → 6 contains event6 and contains no event7. Thus C1 (""event6 does not happen"") is false in this sequence, and event7 does not happen, so C2 (""C1 holds or event7 happens"") is false in this sequence. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event3 happens.""
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 has happened, making C1 true.
- C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is already true (because event3 happened), the implication in C2 is true regardless of whether event2 ever happens.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: event1 happens or event3 happens (event1 ∨ event3).
- C2: if event2 happens, then C1 holds (event2 → (event1 ∨ event3)).

Step 2 — use the given facts
- The context states: ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 does happen (at least at the start).

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- Because event3 happened, C1 (event1 ∨ event3) is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The implication event2 → C1 is true whenever C1 is true (regardless of whether event2 occurs). Since C1 is true, C2 holds.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 is the implication ""If C1 (event2 does not happen) holds, then event7 happens.""
- The context begins with ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 does occur in every allowed scenario (so C1 — ""event2 does not happen"" — cannot hold).
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Since C1 is impossible given the premises, ""If C1 then event7"" is true in all models of the premises.
- Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- The context states initially event2 happened, so the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"" (C2) is true.
---
We are asked whether the implication ""If C1 (event2 does not happen) then event7 happens"" (C2) is true given the scenario.

1. The context explicitly states ""Initially, event2 happened."" That is a given fact.
2. C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen,"" which contradicts that given fact. Therefore C1 is false in every model consistent with the context.
3. In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C1 cannot hold, ""If C1 then event7"" is true (there are no cases where the antecedent holds and the consequent fails).

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to check whether ""If event7 happens, then (if event4 happens then event3 happens)"" is guaranteed by the rules.

Look at the allowed transitions:
- After event1: {event3, event7}
- After event7: {event1, event2, event3, event5}
- After event2: {event1, event5, event6}
- After event6: {event1, event2, event4}
- After event4: {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7}

A counterexample sequence starting from the given initial event1:
1. event1 (initial)
2. event7 (allowed after event1)
3. event2 (allowed after event7)
4. event6 (allowed after event2)
5. event4 (allowed after event6)
6. event2 (allowed after event4)

Here event7 did occur earlier, but when event4 occurred its next event was event2 (not event3). That shows C1 (""if event4 happens then event3 happens"") can be false even in a run where event7 happened, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 says: if event7 happens, then C1 holds. C1 says: if event4 happens, then event3 happens. So C2 is equivalent to: whenever event7 occurs, every time event4 occurs it must be followed by event3.
- We can find a concrete sequence consistent with the given rules that makes event7 true but violates C1:
  1. Initially event1 happens (given).
  2. After event1 we may have event7 (allowed).
  3. After event7 we may have event3 (allowed).
  4. After event3 we may have event4 (allowed).
  5. After event4 we may have event2 (allowed) — so event4 was not followed by event3 in this occurrence.
- This sequence obeys all the ""after"" constraints but shows event7 occurred while an occurrence of event4 did not lead to event3, so C1 does not hold after event7.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret rules
- The rules give possible immediate successors for each event (a directed graph).
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event3 happens"" means: whenever 4 occurs its immediate successor must be 3.
- C2: ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" means: whenever 7 occurs, the property C1 must be true thereafter.

Step 2 — check reachability and counterexample
- From the initial event1 we can do: 1 -> 7 (since after 1 either 3 or 7).
- From 7 we can go 7 -> 2.
- From 2 we can go 2 -> 6.
- From 6 we can go 6 -> 4.
Thus there is a reachable sequence where 7 occurs and later 4 occurs.

Step 3 — show C1 fails in that situation
- After event4 the rules allow successors {2,3,5,6,7}. In particular 4 -> 2 is allowed, so 4 need not be followed by 3.
- Therefore C1 is false even on a path where 7 has occurred.

Conclusion
C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Interpret C1 as “event7 does not happen (from now on)” (i.e., eventually always ¬event7), and C2 as “C1 eventually holds” (there is a tail of the execution where event7 never occurs).
- From the rules: after event3 or event6, event7 is an allowed next event. After event7, event6 is allowed; after event6, event7 is allowed. So there is a cycle 7 -> 6 -> 7 -> 6 -> ... that can be taken indefinitely.
- Starting from the initial event2 we can pick transitions 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 7 -> 6 -> ... so event7 occurs infinitely often on that run.
- Because there exists a run where event7 keeps occurring forever, it is not guaranteed that eventually event7 will never happen. Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event2 happens.
- From event2 you may go to event3 (allowed).
- From event3 you may go to event7 (allowed).
- From event7 you may go to event6 (allowed).
- From event6 you may go to event7 (allowed).

Thus the infinite execution 2 → 3 → 7 → 6 → 7 → 6 → 7 → ... is permitted by the rules and contains event7 infinitely often. C1 (""event7 does not happen"") is not true on that run, and C2 (""eventually C1 holds"", i.e. there is a point after which event7 never occurs) is falsified by this execution. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: event2 occurs. From event2 we can go to event3 or event5.
- If we choose 2 -> 3, from event3 one allowed next event is 7 (3 -> 7).
- From event7 one allowed next event is event6 (7 -> 6 is allowed).
- From event6 one allowed next event is event7 (6 -> 7 is allowed).

Thus there is a valid infinite trace 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 7 -> 6 -> 7 -> ... where event7 keeps occurring forever. That means it is not the case that, eventually, event7 never happens (C1 does not become permanently true). Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

Votes: {'True': 2, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- The hypothesis C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and Event4 does not happen.""
- We are given that Event1 happened initially, so the ""Event1 happens"" part already holds.
- After Event1, one of {Event3, Event4, Event5} must occur. To avoid Event4 we can choose Event3 (or Event5).
- If we choose Event3, then after Event3 one of {Event1, Event6} must occur. Choose Event1. This returns us to the same state (Event1) and we can repeat the 1 → 3 → 1 loop indefinitely.
- In that loop Event4 never occurs, and Event1 did happen (initially). No rule forces us to take Event4 at any stage, so it is possible to satisfy ""Event1 happens and Event4 does not happen.""

Therefore C2 can be satisfied, so the answer is True.
---
False

Reasoning: The background gives that event1 initially happens, so the ""Event1 happens"" part of C2 is true. But C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is not forced by the rules: after event1 one of event3, event4, or event5 must occur, so a valid continuation is to pick event4. Because event4 can occur, ""event4 does not happen"" is not entailed. Therefore the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed by the context.
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event1 occurs. From event1 we can choose event3 (instead of event4). From event3 we can choose event1 again. Repeating (1 → 3 → 1 → 3 …) satisfies all obligations for the events that actually occur and never produces event4. So ""event4 does not happen"" is possible but not forced; C2 (which asserts both event1 happens and event4 does not happen) is satisfiable but not entailed by the premises. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true, so answer: False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., ""It is not the case that Event1 does not happen"" → Event1 does happen.)

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context begins: ""Initially, event1 happened."" That makes the statement ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) false.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 states ""Event1 does not happen.""
- The context begins with ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so C1 is false.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

- The context begins with ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means event1 does happen.
- C1 states ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the initial fact, so C1 is false.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold,"" i.e., C1 is false. Since C1 is indeed false, C2 is true.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3 the allowed next events are {event2, event6, event7}.
- From event2 the allowed next events are {event3, event4, event6, event7}.
- So there is a valid infinite sequence 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... that never includes event5.
- Therefore event5 is not guaranteed to happen in every possible continuation, so ""Event5 always happens"" (C1) does not hold.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — understand the claim
- C1: ""Event5 always happens"" means every possible sequence of events starting from the initial event3 must at some point include event5.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" means there is some possible sequence starting from event3 that never includes event5.

Step 2 — examine transitions (unique rules)
- From 3 → {2, 6, 7}
- From 7 → {1, 2, 6}
- From 6 → {3, 4, 7}
- From 2 → {3, 4, 6, 7}
- From 4 → {1, 3, 6, 7}
- From 1 → {2, 5, 6, 7}
- From 5 → {3, 7}

Step 3 — find a sequence avoiding event5
- Starting at 3, take 3 → 7 → 6 → 3. Each step is allowed by the rules, and this cycle (3–7–6–3) contains no event5.
- That cycle can be repeated indefinitely, so there exists a possible (infinite) sequence from the initial event3 that never visits event5.

Conclusion
- C1 is false (event5 does not always happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The only transition that can produce event5 is ""after event1 -> {2,5,6,7}"". So to ever get event5, the sequence must visit event1 at some point.
- Starting state is event3. From event3 the allowed next events are {2,6,7}.
- There is a closed choice set S = {2,3,6} that can be followed indefinitely without ever visiting event1 (or 4,7,5):
  - 3 -> can go to 2 or 6 (both in S),
  - 2 -> can go to 3 or 6 (both in S),
  - 6 -> can go to 3 (in S).
  Thus one can cycle among 3,2,6 forever and avoid 7 and 4, which are the only ways to reach event1.
- Because such an infinite path exists that never visits event1, event5 is not inevitable (it does not ""always happen"").
- Therefore C1 (""Event5 always happens"") does not hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning in steps:
- The problem states that initially event4 happened. So C1 (""event4 eventually happens"") is true (the initial occurrence satisfies ""eventually"").
- C2 is the implication ""if event4 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is already true, the implication is true (an implication with a true consequent holds).
- Alternatively, at any point where event4 happens, that occurrence itself satisfies ""event4 eventually happens"" (eventually includes the current time), so the implication holds directly.
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. event4 → eventually event4)

Step 2 — use the context
- The context states ""Initially, event4 happened."" That means at the initial time event4 has already occurred, so C1 is true (there exists a time — the initial time — when event4 happens).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- An implication with a true consequent is always true, so since C1 is true, C2 is true regardless of whether the antecedent holds.
- Independently, for any occurrence of event4 at some time t, ""eventually event4"" is satisfied at t (the occurrence itself counts), so event4 → eventually event4 holds by the usual meaning of ""eventually.""

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., event4 → (event4 eventually happens))

Step 2 — examine the scenario
- The scenario even begins with ""Initially, event4 happened."" So C1 is already true (event4 has already occurred).
- More generally, in temporal logic ""event4 → eventually event4"" is trivially true: if event4 holds now, then ""event4 eventually happens"" is satisfied (event4 has already occurred at or before the considered time).

Step 3 — conclusion
C2 is True."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether ""If event7 happens and event4 happens, then event6 happens"" must be true given the rules. That is, whether every allowed sequence that contains both event7 and event4 must also contain event6.

Relevant rules (condensed):
- Start: event2 initially.
- After 2 → one of {4,5,6,7}
- After 7 → one of {1,3,4,6}
- After 4 → one of {1,5}
- After 5 → one of {2,3,7}
- After 1 → one of {2,5,6,7}
- After 3 → one of {4,5}
- After 6 → one of {2,4,5,7}

To disprove the implication it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence where both 7 and 4 occur but 6 never occurs. One such sequence starting from the initial event2:

2 → 7 (allowed from 2)
7 → 4 (allowed from 7)
4 → 5 (allowed from 4)
5 → 2 (allowed from 5)

This gives the cycle 2 → 7 → 4 → 5 → 2 → ... which repeats and never uses event6. Both event7 and event4 occur in this sequence, yet event6 never occurs. Therefore the implication is not forced by the rules.

Final answer: False
---
First restate the hypothesis:
- C1: both event7 and event4 happen (somewhere in the execution).
- C2: If C1 holds, then event6 happens.

We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the rules (i.e., whether every execution that contains both 7 and 4 must also contain 6).

Summarize the transition rules (condensed):
- 1 -> {2,5,6,7}
- 2 -> {4,5,6,7}
- 3 -> {4,5}
- 4 -> {1,5}
- 5 -> {2,3,7}
- 6 -> {2,4,5,7}
- 7 -> {1,3,4,6}

Initial event: 2.

We only need one counterexample execution where both 4 and 7 occur but 6 never occurs to show C2 is false. Such an execution exists:

Start at 2 (given),
- 2 -> 4 (so 4 happens),
- 4 -> 1,
- 1 -> 2,
- 2 -> 7 (so 7 happens),
- 7 -> 4,
and repeat this cycle (4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> ...).

At every step we avoided choosing the transitions that produce event6; each choice is allowed by the rules. This execution contains both event4 and event7 but never contains event6. Therefore C1 can hold while event6 does not happen.

Final answer: False.
---
We want to know whether ""If C1 holds (events 7 and 4 happen), then event6 happens"" is guaranteed by the given rules.

Transitions (unique summary):
- start: 2
- 1 → {2,5,6,7}
- 2 → {4,5,6,7}
- 3 → {4,5}
- 4 → {1,5}
- 5 → {2,3,7}
- 6 → {2,4,5,7}
- 7 → {1,3,4,6}

Find a valid sequence from the start (2) that contains both 4 and 7 but never contains 6. One such sequence:
2 → 4 (allowed), 4 → 1 (allowed), 1 → 7 (allowed).

This sequence includes events 4 and 7 and never includes event 6, so C1 can hold without event6 happening. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Reasoning: Initially event1 happens and after event1 one of {4,5,6,7} must happen. Since event6 is allowed immediately after event1, a sequence consistent with the premises can include event6, which makes C1 true. C2 asserts that neither event2 nor event6 happens; that is not guaranteed by the premises, so C2 is not true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2 asserts: ""If event6 happens, then event5 happens in the next state.""
- The rules say: ""After event6, either event1, or event4 must happen."" That is, the immediate successor of event6 is either event1 or event4.
- Neither of those guarantees that event5 is the immediate next event. (From event1 you may get event5, and from event4 you may get event5, but those would be one additional step — not the immediate next state — and in both cases event5 is only one of multiple alternatives.)
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the rules.
---
Step 1 — identify the claims:
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the current state).
- C2: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., whenever event6 occurs, the next state is event5).

Step 2 — extract transition rules (condensed):
- 7 -> {1, 3}
- 1 -> {3, 5, 7}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 6}
- 2 -> {4, 6}
- 4 -> {3, 5}
- 5 -> {1}
- 6 -> {1, 4}

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2 if possible:
- From the initial event7 we can follow 7 -> 3 (allowed), then 3 -> 6 (allowed). So event6 can occur.
- From event6 the next state must be either 1 or 4 (6 -> {1,4}); neither is event5. So after this occurrence of event6, event5 does not happen in the next state.

Thus the implication ""if event6 happens then event5 happens next"" is not guaranteed. C2 is False.

False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event7 occurs. After event7, we may go to event3 (rule: after event7 either event1 or event3).
- After event3, we may go to event6 (rule: after event3 either event1, event2, or event6).
- After event6, the next event may be event1 (rule: after event6 either event1 or event4).
- That next event being event1 means ""Event5 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false in this branch.
- Therefore there exists a possible execution where event6 happens but C1 does not hold, so the conditional C2 (""If event6 happens, then C1 holds"") is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Identify the claim: C2 says “if event5 eventually happens (C1), then event1 happens.”
- From the context we know as a fact that event1 happened initially. That means event1 is already true regardless of whether event5 ever occurs.
- For an implication (C1 → event1), if the consequent (event1) is already true, the implication is true regardless of the antecedent.
- (As additional support: if event5 did occur later, the rules also allow paths back to event1 via event6 → event1, so event1 would be reachable anyway.)

Therefore C2 is True.
---

---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C2 says: ""If event5 eventually happens (C1), then event1 happens.""
  
Step 2 — examine the premises
- The context states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is already true (has happened) in every allowed sequence.

Step 3 — logical conclusion
- An implication (C1 → event1) is true whenever the consequent (event1) is true, regardless of whether the antecedent (C1) holds.
- Since event1 has happened initially, the consequent is true in all cases, so the implication C2 holds.

Sample responses:
True.

Reasoning:
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- From the context we are given that ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is already true (it occurred).
- An implication ""If P then Q"" is true whenever Q is already true, regardless of whether P (C1) holds.
Therefore C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""If event7 happens, then event6 happens.""
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 already occurred regardless of C1.
- Therefore, assuming C1 holds (or not), event1 has happened — so the implication in C2 is satisfied.

Hence C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""If event7 happens, then event6 happens.""
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is already true in the given scenario.
- An implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is true whenever the consequent (event1 happens) is true, regardless of whether the antecedent (C1) holds.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- The rules say: after event2, either event4 or event7 must happen next. Event3 is not allowed immediately after event2.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 is the statement ""C1 does not hold"", which is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the rules and the initial state:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- The rule(s) for after event2: ""After event2, either event4, or event7 must happen.""

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- From the rule, the immediate next event after event2 can only be event4 or event7. Event3 is not among the allowed immediate successors of event2.
- Therefore C1 (event3 happens in the next state) is false.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- C2 states that C1 does not hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Start state: event2 happened.
- The rules state: after event2, the next event must be either event4 or event7.
- Therefore event3 cannot happen in the immediate next state, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold,"" which is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event7 happens or event4 happens.""
- Initially, event7 happened. So C1 is true immediately at the start.
- ""Eventually"" includes the current moment (there exists some time ≥ now when C1 holds), so C1 already holds and thus C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

(If one insisted ""eventually"" meant strictly in the future, there are infinite runs from the initial event7 that avoid any later 4 or 7—for example 7 → 1 → 5 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 6 → ...—so under that stricter reading C2 would be false. Under the usual reading that includes the present, C2 is True.)
---
True

Reasoning: C1 is ""Event7 happens or event4 happens."" The problem states that initially event7 happened, so C1 already holds at the start. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied (the eventuality is true immediately).
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 has happened.
- C1 is ""event7 happens or event4 happens."" Since event7 already happened at the initial moment, C1 is already true.
- Therefore C1 eventually holds (indeed it holds immediately), so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 is the proposition ""if event3 happens, then event5 happens"" — interpreted as the at-state implication event3 ⇒ event5.
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state (the state immediately after the initial state).
- From the context, the initial state is event6; the next state must be either event1 or event7.
- In either of those next states event3 is false, so the implication event3 ⇒ event5 is vacuously true there.
- Therefore C1 does hold in the next state, so C2 is True.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true. C1 is: ""If event3 happens, then event5 happens.""

1. Initially event6 happened. So the next state is either event1 or event7.
2. Consider the branch where the next state is event1. From event1, event3 is one allowed next event (after event1 either event2, event3, or event4 must happen). So event3 can occur from that state.
3. After event3, the rules allow event1, event2, or event5. There is no requirement that event5 must occur; the system can choose event1 (or event2) instead of event5. For example: event6 → event1 → event3 → event1 is a valid trace where event3 occurs but is not followed by event5.
4. Because there is a valid continuation in the next state where event3 happens but event5 does not, C1 does not hold in that next state. (The same counterexample exists if the next state is event7 → event3 → event1, etc.)

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- C1 is: (event5 → event1).
- C2 is: (event1 → C1), i.e. event1 → (event5 → event1).
- In classical logic, A → (B → A) is a tautology: once A is true, any implication ""if B then A"" is automatically true.
- The context even states event1 has happened initially, so event1 is true; therefore (event5 → event1) holds, and thus C2 holds.

So C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- C1 states: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens."" That is, in any execution where event5 occurs at some point, event1 must hold at some point (past or future).
- The problem statement begins with ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means every possible execution/trace already contains event1 (at the initial moment).
- Therefore in every trace, whenever event5 occurs (whenever it does), event1 has already occurred (at the initial step). So C1 is true in all traces.
- C2 asserts: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event1 does happen (initially) and C1 is true globally, the implication in C2 is true.

Thus C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 is: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens.""
So C2 is logically: event1 -> (event5 -> event1).

Step 2 — logical reasoning:
- In propositional logic A -> (B -> A) is a tautology: if A is true, then regardless of B, the implication B -> A is true.
- Here A = ""event1 happens"", B = ""event5 happens"". So if event1 happens, then (if event5 happens then event1 happens) is automatically true.

Conclusion: C2 is True."

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the meaning: C1 is the universal implication ""whenever event2 happens, event5 happens (as the next event)"". C2 says that C1 eventually holds.

Relevant rules (simplified):
- Initial: event7.
- After event7 → {1,2,5,6}.
- After event2 → {1,3,5,6}.
- After event1 → {2,5}.
(Other rules exist but the two above are enough.)

Construct a counterexample path starting from the initial event7:
- From event7 choose event2.
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event2 (allowed).
Now we have the infinite loop ... → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... in which event2 occurs but is repeatedly followed by event1, not event5. This shows C1 is false (event2 does not always lead to event5). Because such a loop can be repeated forever, C1 does not eventually become true either.

Final answer: False
---

---
C2 is False.

Reasoning succinctly:
- C1 states: whenever event2 happens, event5 happens (i.e., event5 must follow event2).
- From the given transitions: event7 -> {1,2,5,6}, event2 -> {1,3,5,6}, event1 -> {2,5}.
- Starting from the initial event7, choose the successor 2 (allowed). From event2 choose 1 (allowed). From event1 choose 2 (allowed). This yields the infinite loop 7,2,1,2,1,2,... in which event2 occurs repeatedly but event5 never occurs.
- Thus C1 is false on that run (event2 occurs without event5), so there is a possible execution where C1 never becomes true. Therefore C1 does not eventually hold in all executions.

Final answer: False"

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says event5 and event3 both happen. That can occur: start with the initial event5, then pick event4 (allowed after event5), then pick event3 (allowed after event4). So 5,4,3 has occurred and C1 holds.
- From that point, the system can cycle 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 ... indefinitely, because after 3 we may choose 4, and after 4 we may choose 3. This avoids event2 and event6 (the only events that can lead to event1).
- Since there is a valid sequence where C1 holds but event1 never happens, the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happens (given).
- To get event3 while staying consistent with the rules you can take: event5 -> event4 -> event3. So C1 (event5 and event3 happen) can hold.
- From event3 you may go to event4 or event5; from event4 you may go to event3, event5, or event7; from event5 you may go to event2 or event4.
- There is a valid cycle 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 ... that stays within {3,4,5} and never takes the choices that lead to event2 or event6 (the only ways to reach event1). Nothing in the rules forces a transition to event2 or event6.
- Therefore it is possible for C1 to hold while event1 never happens. So the implication ""if C1 then event1"" is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning summary:
- Initial event5 occurs.
- From the rules, event1 can only occur after event2 (or after event6, which is never produced by any rule here).
- After event5 we may choose event4 (instead of event2). After event4 we may choose event3 (instead of event7 or event5). After event3 we may choose event4, and after that again choose event5, and so on.
- Example valid sequence: 5 (initial) -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> ... This sequence contains both event5 and event3 (so C1 holds) but never produces event2, hence never produces event1.
- Because there exists a legal sequence where C1 holds but event1 does not happen, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- From the context, the possible next events after event4 are {event1, event2, event3}.
- C1 asserts that event5 happens in the next state.
- If event4 happens, the next state must be one of {1,2,3}; event5 is not among these possibilities, so event5 does not (and cannot) happen immediately after event4.
- Therefore the implication ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens next"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the rules, after event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- None of those options is event5, so event5 cannot occur immediately after event4.
- C2 asserts ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens in the next state"" (i.e. event5 must follow event4). That contradicts the transition for event4, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
C2 states: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event5 happens in the next state."" So C2 asserts: whenever event4 occurs, the next event must be event5.

Step 2 — examine transitions:
The context gives: ""After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen."" (repeated). Event5 is not among the allowed next events after event4.

Step 3 — counterexample:
A concrete allowed sequence: ... -> event4 -> event1. Here event4 occurs but the next event is event1 (not event5), which is permitted by the rules.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- Rules simplify to: after 5 → {3,4,6}; after 3 → {1,5,6,7}; (others irrelevant for this counterexample).
- Start: event5 happened initially.
- Choose next = event3 (allowed). From 3, choose next = event5 (allowed).
- This yields the loop 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → ... which never includes event1.
- Therefore there exists a valid execution in which event1 never happens, so ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., Event1 does not always happen)

Step 2 — Examine the initial condition and rules:
- Initially, event5 happened.
- The rules say: after event5, the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event6}.
  (Other rules list transitions for other events, but the immediate relevant one is the transition from event5.)

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Because the initial event is event5, the very next event cannot be event1 (only event3, event4, or event6 are allowed).
- Therefore it is not the case that Event1 ""always happens"" (there is at least one event occurrence—initially event5—where Event1 did not happen, and the next event also cannot be event1).
- So C1 is false, and thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event5 (given).
- From event5 the allowed next events are {3,4,6}. Choose event3.
- From event3 the allowed next events include event5 ({1,5,6,7}). Choose event5.
- This gives the cycle 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → ... which never visits event1.
- Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false, so ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is true."

Votes: {'True': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Start: event2 happens.
- From event2 one allowed next event is event6.
- From event6 one allowed next event is event2.
- Thus there is a valid infinite loop 2 → 6 → 2 → 6 → … that never uses event1.

Along that run event1 never occurs, so the property C1 (""event1 does not happen"") holds (in fact from the start), and therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied. Hence C2 is True.
---

---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., from some point on, event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is a future point after which event1 never happens (equivalently: there exists an infinite execution in which event1 never occurs, and from some time onward no event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the transitions (graph)
- 2 -> {1, 6}
- 1 -> {3, 4, 6}
- 6 -> {2, 3, 5}
- 3 -> {1, 6, 7}
- 4 -> {1, 3}
- 5 -> {6, 7}
- 7 -> {1, 2, 5, 6}

Step 3 — find a path avoiding event1 forever
- From the initial event2 take the transition 2 -> 6.
- From 6 take 6 -> 2.
- This yields the 2-cycle 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> 6 -> ... which never visits event1.

Because this infinite run never contains event1, C1 holds (indeed from the start) on that run, so C1 eventually holds.

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 = ""Event4 happens or event1 happens."" C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event4 nor event1 happens).
- Initially event3 happens. From event3 the rules allow event1, event4, or event5 to happen next.
- So there is a valid sequence where event1 (or event4) does occur (for example: 3 → 1). In that sequence C1 is true.
- Because a sequence exists in which C1 holds, the claim ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not true in general.

Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Start: 7 happens (given).
- From 7 we may choose 1 (since 7 -> (1 or 3)).
- From 1 we may choose 4 (since 1 -> (4 or 5)).
- From 4 we may choose 7 (since 4 -> (3 or 7)).
- Repeating the choices 7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 7 -> ... yields a valid execution where 4 occurs but neither 3 nor 6 ever occurs (6 can only occur after 3, and we never choose 3).

Thus there exists a permitted sequence in which event4 happens but neither event3 nor event6 happens, so ""if event4 then (event6 or event3)"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event6 happens or event3 happens"" (6 ∨ 3).
- From the rules: 4 → (3 ∨ 7), 7 → (1 ∨ 3), 1 → (4 ∨ 5).
- If 4 → 3 then C1 holds (3 occurs). But 4 may instead lead to 7.
- From 7 we may choose 1 (instead of 3). From 1 we may choose 4 (instead of 5).
- This yields the cycle 4 → 7 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 1 → ... in which neither 3 nor 6 ever occurs.
- Because there is a valid sequence where 4 happens but neither 3 nor 6 ever happens, the implication ""if 4 happens then (6 or 3)"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Let's restate the rules succinctly (duplicates removed):
- Initially event7 happened.
- 6 -> 4
- 4 -> {3, 7}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 6, 7}
- 7 -> {1, 3}
- 1 -> {4, 5}
- 2 -> 1
- 5 -> {2, 3}

C2 asserts: ""If event4 happens, then (event6 happens or event3 happens).""

Find a counterexample trace consistent with the rules where 4 occurs but neither 3 nor 6 ever occurs afterward:

Starting from the initial 7:
- 7 -> 1 (choose 1)
- 1 -> 4 (choose 4)  — now event4 has happened
- 4 -> 7 (choose 7)
- 7 -> 1 (choose 1)
- 1 -> 4 (choose 4)
... and repeat the cycle 4 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4 indefinitely.

In this cycle neither event3 nor event6 ever occurs, so the implication ""if 4 happens then (6 or 3 happens)"" is not guaranteed by the given rules. Therefore C2 is False.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Plan:
- Identify what C1 and C2 mean.
- Check the transition rules.
- Find a concrete allowed continuation after event2 that avoids event6 forever (counterexample to C2).

1) Interpretation
- C1: ""Event6 always happens"" — i.e., in every possible continuation/event sequence event6 will occur.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., whenever event2 occurs, from that point on event6 will inevitably occur in all continuations.

2) Relevant transitions (restating concisely)
- After 2 → 1 (forced).
- After 1 → {3,4,7} (choice).
- After 3 → {1,2,4} (choice).
- 4,5,7,6 have other choices but none force 6 except as an optional outcome from 7 or 5.

3) Counterexample (shows C2 false)
Start at 2:
- 2 → 1 (forced).
- Choose 1 → 3.
- Choose 3 → 2.
Now we are back at 2 and can repeat the same choices indefinitely: 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ... This infinite loop is allowed by the rules and never visits event6. Hence event6 is not inevitable after event2.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- From event2 we must go to event1 (2 -> 1).
- From event1 we can go to event3 (1 -> 3).
- From event3 we can go back to event2 (3 -> 2).

Thus there is a loop 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> ... that can repeat forever and never visits event6. That shows event6 does not necessarily occur after event2, so ""If event2 happens, then Event6 always happens"" is false.
---
C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event2 occurs, then event6 will (inevitably) always happen.

From the rules:
- After event2 must come event1.
- After event1 one possible next is event3.
- After event3 one possible next is event2.

So starting from an occurrence of event2 we can follow the cycle:
event2 -> event1 -> event3 -> event2 -> ... 
This cycle never forces event6; it can be repeated indefinitely and avoids event6 forever.

Because there is a valid continuation after event2 that never produces event6, event2 does not guarantee that event6 will always happen. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event5 happens, so the ""event5"" part of C1 holds already.
- From the rules, after event3 you can go to event6; after event6 you can go to event5; and after event5 you can go to event3. So there is a cycle 3 → 6 → 5 → 3 that never visits event4.
- Therefore it's possible that event3 occurs while event4 never occurs (even though event5 has occurred). That makes the implication ""if event3 happens then (event5 and event4)"" false.
---
We want to check C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" (C1 = ""event5 happens and event4 happens"".)

Observations from the rules:
- Initially event5 happens, so any execution already satisfies the ""event5 happens"" part of C1.
- So C2 reduces to: whenever event3 happens, must event4 also happen at some point?

Find a counterexample execution where event3 occurs but event4 never occurs:
- Start: event5 (given).
- Choose event3 next (allowed: after event5 → {1,3,4,6}).
- From event3 choose event6 (allowed: after event3 → {1,4,6}).
- From event6 choose event1 (allowed: after event6 → {1,3,5,7}).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed: after event1 → {3,4,7}).

This yields the loop: 5 → 3 → 6 → 1 → 3 → ... which never includes event4. So event3 occurs but event4 never does, hence C1 is false in this execution (event5 did occur but event4 did not). Therefore C2 (""if event3 happens then C1 holds"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- The context says event5 happens initially, and gives allowed successors:
  5 -> {1,3,4,6}; 3 -> {1,4,6}; 1 -> {3,4,7}; (others irrelevant here).
- C1 requires event5 and event4. Event5 already holds initially, so C1 reduces to “event4 happens.”
- C2 claims: if event3 happens then event4 happens (since event5 is already true).
- Counterexample trace showing C2 can fail:
  Start with event5 (given), choose successor event3 (allowed by 5 -> {1,3,4,6}).
  From event3 choose event1 (allowed by 3 -> {1,4,6}).
  From event1 choose event3 (allowed by 1 -> {3,4,7}).
  Repeat 3 ↔ 1 forever. In this trace event3 occurs but event4 never occurs.
- Thus it is possible for event3 to happen while C1 (i.e. event4) does not hold, so C2 is not entailed.

Therefore the correct answer is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The system starts with event2 having happened.
- The rules state: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes the state reached after the initial event2 terminal—no further events (including event3) can ever occur.
- Therefore event3 does not happen (C1 holds) immediately and for all future times.
- Since C1 already holds, ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happens.
- The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" makes the execution terminate immediately after that initial event.
- Therefore no events after the initial event2 can ever occur — in particular event3 never occurs.
- So C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is true from the start, and hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true (it holds immediately).
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the run C1 is true — here meaning from that point onward event3 does not occur).

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and rules:
- The trace begins with event2 occurring.
- The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means the sequence stops immediately after that initial event2; no further events occur.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- Since no events after the initial event2 can occur, event3 never occurs in the run. Thus C1 is true immediately.
- Because C1 is true from the start, it certainly ""eventually holds.""

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event4 happens (given).
- The rule ""After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen"" allows event3 to occur immediately after the initial event4.
- That directly contradicts C1 (""Event3 does not happen""), so C1 can be false.
- Since event4 does happen and does not guarantee C1, the implication ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" (C2) is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: If event4 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event4 happens then event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen (4 -> {1,3}).

Step 3 — trace a valid sequence:
- Start: event4 (given).
- From the rule 4 -> {1,3}, it is allowed that event3 happens next: sequence 4 → 3 is valid.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- In that valid sequence event3 does happen, so C1 is false.
- Since event4 happens and C1 can be false, the implication ""if event4 happens then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
Identify hypothesis: C2 says ""If event4 happens, then event3 does not happen (C1)"". So C2 is claiming event4 implies ¬event3.

From the context: initially event4 happened. The rule ""After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen."" Therefore starting from the initial event4 we can (and must) have event3 occur (we can choose the branch event3). That yields event4 occurs and event3 occurs, contradicting C1. Thus C2 is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") follows from the given context. C1 is ""Event4 does not happen"", so C2 is the disjunction: ""Event4 does not happen OR event2 happens.""

To refute C2 it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence (consistent with the rules) where event4 does happen and event2 never happens. Starting from the initial event5:

- 5 → 7 (after 5, 7 must happen)
- 7 → 1 (7 allows 1)
- 1 → 4 (1 allows 4)

So event4 occurs. From 4 we can continue without ever using event2:

- 4 → 5 (4 allows 5)
- 5 → 7
- 7 → 3
- 3 → 4

This yields a cycle 4 → 5 → 7 → 3 → 4 that never includes event2. Thus there is a valid execution in which event4 does occur and event2 never occurs, making the disjunction ""not event4 OR event2"" false in that execution. Therefore C2 is not entailed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
We ask whether every possible sequence from the given rules satisfies (not Event4) OR Event2. To refute that, it suffices to give one valid sequence where Event4 occurs and Event2 never occurs.

Start with the given initial event5. The rules allow this sequence:
5 -> 7 (after 5, must go to 7)
7 -> 1 (after 7, choose 1; allowed)
1 -> 4 (after 1, choose 4; allowed)
4 -> 5 (after 4, choose 5; allowed)
Then the loop repeats: 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> ...

This valid infinite run contains Event4 but never contains Event2. Thus C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false in that run, and Event2 does not happen, so C2 = (C1 or Event2) is false for that run. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event5 happens. From event5, event7 must happen.
- From event7, we can choose event1 (rules allow 1,2,3,5).
- From event1, we can choose event4 (rules allow 2,3,4,7).
- That yields the sequence 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4, where event4 occurs and event2 never occurred.
- Thus C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false in this possible sequence, and event2 also did not happen. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is not guaranteed and can be false. Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
The claim C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then eventually event6 or event3 happens."" We need to check whether every allowed continuation after an occurrence of event2 must lead to event3 or event6.

From the rules:
- event2 -> {3,4,6,7}
- event4 -> {1,2,5}
- event1 -> {3,5}
- event5 -> {3,4,7}
- event7 -> {1,2,3,4,5,6}
(and event3 -> {4,5}, event6 -> {1,2,3,4,5,7})

A counterexample path that avoids both 3 and 6 after event2 is:
initial event7 -> event2 -> event4 -> event1 -> event5 -> event4 -> event1 -> event5 -> ... 
(choose 4->1, 1->5, 5->4 repeatedly).

This infinite loop 4->1->5->4 never visits event3 or event6, so after event2 it is possible for neither event3 nor event6 ever to happen. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning and counterexample:
- C1 = ""event6 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2 = ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""

From the rules:
- Initially event7.
- 7 -> {1,2,3,4,5,6}
- 2 -> {3,4,6,7}
- 4 -> {1,2,5}
- 1 -> {3,5}
- 5 -> {3,4,7}

Starting from the initial event7, pick the following choices to produce a valid infinite trace in which event2 occurs but neither 3 nor 6 ever happens:
7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... 
At each step the chosen successor is allowed by the rules (2->4, 4->1, 1->5, 5->4), and the cycle 4->1->5->4 avoids both 3 and 6 forever. So event2 occurs in this trace, but C1 (presence of 3 or 6) never becomes true. Therefore the implication in C2 does not hold in general.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event6 happens or event3 happens"" (i.e., eventually 6 or 3 occurs).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed (true) given the transition rules and the initial event7.

Step 2 — relevant transitions (condensed)
- 7 -> {1,2,3,4,5,6}
- 2 -> {3,4,6,7}
- 4 -> {1,2,5}
- 1 -> {3,5}
- 5 -> {3,4,7}
- 3 -> {4,5}
- 6 -> {1,2,3,4,5,7}

Step 3 — find a counterexample if one exists
We need a possible run where event2 occurs but thereafter neither 3 nor 6 ever happens.

From the initial 7 we can choose 7 -> 2 (allowed). From 2, choose 2 -> 4. From 4, choose 4 -> 2. Repeat 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4 ... forever. All chosen transitions are allowed, and this infinite sequence never visits event3 or event6.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid continuation in which event2 occurs and yet neither event3 nor event6 ever happens, the implication ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the rules: 2 -> {5,6,7}, 7 -> {3,5,6}, 6 -> {4,5,7}.
- Starting at the initial event2, pick 7 (allowed). From 7 pick 6 (allowed). From 6 pick 7 (allowed). This yields the infinite cycle 2,7,6,7,6,... which contains event7 but never contains event5.
- That is a valid execution consistent with the rules in which C1 (event7 occurs) holds but event5 does not. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"" is false.
---
True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1 says ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., every time step the event is 7).
- But the rules include: after event7 the next event must be one of {3, 5, 6}. In particular, the next event cannot be 7.
- Therefore it is impossible for event7 to occur at every step — C1 is inconsistent with the transition rules (C1 cannot hold).
- An implication ""If C1 then event5"" is vacuously true when the antecedent C1 is impossible. Hence C2 is true.

Sample responses:

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event7 happens or event4 happens.""
- The context states that initially event4 happened.
- Therefore C1 already holds at the initial point in time.
- C2 states that C1 eventually holds; since C1 holds immediately, C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""event7 happens or event4 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point either event7 or event4 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- The very first statement says ""Initially, event4 happened.""

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- Because event4 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the initial moment (event4 holds).
- Therefore C1 holds at some time (now), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event7 happens or event4 happens.""
- The context states ""Initially, event4 happened."" So C1 already holds at the initial moment (event4 is true).
- C2 says C1 eventually holds. Since C1 holds immediately at the start, the ""eventually"" requirement is satisfied.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret C2
- C1: ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible future sequence event5 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalently, there exists some valid sequence in which event5 never happens.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (deduped)
- Initially: event6.
- After event6: {event1, event3, event5}.
- After event1: {event2, event3, event4, event6}.
- After event2: {event4, event5}.
- After event3: {event1, event4, event5, event6, event7}.
- After event4: {event1, event2}.
- After event7: {event4, event5, event6}.
- After event5: {event1, event2, event3}.

Step 3 — find a sequence that avoids event5
- From initial event6, choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1, choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4, choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat (1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ...).

This infinite sequence never includes event5, so C1 (that event5 always happens) is false.

Final answer:
True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C2 is the negation of C1; it claims ""Event5 does not always happen.""
- From the rules (condensed):
  - 6 -> {1,3,5}
  - 1 -> {2,3,4,6}
  - 2 -> {4,5}
  - 4 -> {1,2}
  - (other transitions include 3,5,7 but are not needed)
- Starting at the initial event6, pick the successor 1 (allowed).
  - From 1 pick 2 (allowed).
  - From 2 pick 4 (allowed).
  - From 4 pick 1 (allowed).
- This yields the infinite cycle 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... which never includes event5.
Thus event5 is not guaranteed to occur, so C1 does not hold and C2 is True.

- C1: Event5 always happens (i.e., every possible future sequence must include event5).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., there is some possible sequence in which event5 never happens).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — simplify the rules (unique transitions)
- 6 -> {1, 3, 5}
- 5 -> {1, 2, 3}
- 1 -> {2, 3, 4, 6}
- 2 -> {4, 5}
- 3 -> {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- 4 -> {1, 2}
- 7 -> {4, 5, 6}

Start: event6 happened.

Step 3 — find a sequence that avoids event5
From 6 you may choose event1 (6 -> 1). From 1 you may choose event6 (1 -> 6). That gives the loop 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> ... forever. None of those transitions require event5. Therefore there exists a valid infinite sequence starting at the initial event6 that never includes event5.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because a valid sequence exists in which event5 never occurs, C1 (""Event5 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the premises: 1 occurs initially, 1 -> {3,4,5,6,7}, 5 -> {1,2,6}, 6 -> 3, 3 -> {4,5}, etc.
- Construct a valid trace avoiding event4 and event7: choose 1 → 5, then 5 → 6, then 6 → 3 (forced), then 3 → 5, and repeat (5 → 6 → 3 → 5 ...). This satisfies all ""after"" constraints and never produces event4 or event7.
- In that trace event3 does occur but event7 does not, so C1 (""if event3 then event7"") is false in this model. Event4 also never happens.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") is not guaranteed by the premises; it is false (counterexample above).
---
False

Counterexample (valid sequence given the rules):
1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> ... 

- From the initial event1 we choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 we choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 we choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 we must go to event3 (required).
This yields an infinite cycle 3,5,6,3,... in which event4 never occurs and event7 never occurs.

Thus C1 (""if event3 happens then event7 happens"") is violated (there is an occurrence of event3 with no subsequent event7), and event4 does not occur in this model. Therefore C2 (C1 holds or event4 happens) is not guaranteed by the premises.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the premises we have these relevant rules (condensed):
  - Initially event1 happened.
  - After event1 → one of {3,4,5,6,7}.
  - After event3 → one of {4,5}.
  - After event5 → one of {1,2,6}.
  - After event6 → event3.
  - (Other rules allow more options but don’t force 7 from 3.)

- Check C1 (""If event3 happens, then event7 happens""): nothing forces event7 after event3. From event3 we must go to 4 or 5; from 5 we can go to 6, and from 6 we are forced back to 3. This yields a valid infinite cycle that never produces event7 or event4:
  1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> ...
  All transitions in this sequence obey the given rules, yet event7 never occurs.

- In that execution:
  - Event3 does happen, but event7 never does, so C1 is false.
  - Event4 never happens either.

- Therefore the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") is false (both disjuncts can be false under the premises).

So C2 is False."

- C2: C1 ∨ event2

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- The implication (A → A) is a logical tautology; it is always true regardless of whether A (here event2) actually occurs.
- Therefore C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is (C1 ∨ event2). Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event2.

Step 2 — Evaluate C1:
- The statement p -> p is a logical tautology; it is always true regardless of whether p (event2) actually occurs. So C1 holds.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C1 is the statement ""If event7 happens, then event7 happens,"" which is a logical tautology (P → P). A tautology holds in all situations, so ""C1 always holds"" is true.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event7 happens, then event7 happens."" (implication event7 → event7)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is always true.

Step 2 — examine C1
- An implication of the form P → P is a logical tautology: whenever P is true, P is true; when P is false, P → P is also true. So C1 is true in every possible state.

Step 3 — relate to the given conditions
- The listed event-transition rules are irrelevant to the validity of the tautology P → P. No sequence of events can make the self-implication false.

Conclusion
- C1 always holds, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""If event7 happens, then event7 happens"" (formally: event7 → event7).
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds.

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula p → p is a logical tautology: it is true for both truth values of p (if p is true, then p implies p; if p is false, the implication is true vacuously).
- Therefore C1 is universally true regardless of any extra conditions or the event rules.

Step 3 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 is a tautology and thus always true, the claim ""C1 always holds"" is true.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules, after event1 the choices are event5 or event7. If event5 happens then event3 follows (1→5→3). But if instead 1→7, then 7→4 and 4 could choose 1 again, producing the infinite loop 1→7→4→1→7→4→..., in which event3 never occurs. Thus C1 (""if event1 happens then event3 happens"") is not guaranteed — counterexample: 6→1, then 1→7, 7→4, 4→1, ... avoids event3 forever. So C1 is false.
- The alternative disjunct in C2 is ""event4 happens."" Starting from the initial event6, one can avoid event4: choose 6→5→3→1→5→3→... which cycles without ever producing event4. Thus event4 is not inevitable.
- Since neither C1 nor ""event4 happens"" is guaranteed, their disjunction C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The system gives allowed next-events after each event; we start at event4.
- From event4 we may choose event5 (4 -> 5).
- From event5 we may choose event3 (5 -> 3).
- After event3, event7 is forced (3 -> 7). After event7 we may choose event3 again (7 -> 3), and then 3 -> 7, etc.
- This yields a valid infinite trace 4, 5, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, ... in which event3 (so C1) occurs but event2 never occurs.

Thus the implication ""If (event3 or event5) happens then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed, so C2 is False.
---
Step-by-step:

1. From the context, event4 initially happens.
2. After event4, either event5 or event7 must happen. Choose event5.
3. After event5, one of event3, event4, or event7 must happen. Choose event4.
4. After that event4, again either event5 or event7 must happen. Choose event5.
5. This yields a valid infinite loop 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 … that satisfies all given ""after"" constraints, in which event5 does happen but event2 never occurs.

Thus C1 (event3 or event5) can be true (here event5 is true) while event2 is false. Therefore the implication ""if C1 holds then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
Summary of hypothesis:
- C1: event3 or event5 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.

We ask: does C1 imply event2 under the given rules?

Relevant rules (condensed):
- Initial: event4 occurs.
- 4 -> {5,7}
- 5 -> {3,4,7}
- 3 -> 7 (forced)
- 7 -> {3,4,6}
- 6 -> {2,3,5}
(others exist but are not needed for the counterexample)

Counterexample trace showing C1 true but event2 never occurs:
- Start: 4 (given).
- Choose 4 -> 5. Now C1 holds (event5 happened).
- Choose 5 -> 3. Then 3 -> 7 (forced).
- Choose 7 -> 4. Back to 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> ... and so on.

This infinite loop (4,5,3,7,4,5,3,7,...) never includes event2, yet C1 is satisfied (event5 occurred). Therefore C1 does not guarantee event2.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event7 happens, then event7 happens."" This is the formula event7 → event7.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The implication p → p is a tautology; it is true regardless of whether event7 occurs. So C1 is true immediately (and at every point).

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- Since C1 already holds now, it certainly holds at some point (immediately), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning summary:
- C1 is the formula ""if event7 happens, then event7 happens,"" which is a tautological implication (p → p). It holds in every state irrespective of the system transitions.
- Therefore C1 already holds immediately (and hence at some future time).
- C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds; since C1 holds now, C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the formula ""if event7 happens, then event7 happens"" (event7 → event7).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some future point at which C1 is true).

Step 2 — analyze C1
- The formula p → p (here event7 → event7) is a tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether event7 actually occurs.

Step 3 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 is true in the current state (indeed in every state), C1 already holds now, so it certainly ""eventually holds.""

- After event1, one option is event4.
- After event4, event5 must happen.

Thus the sequence 6 → 1 → 4 → 5 is allowed, so both event1 and event5 occur (C1 holds). Therefore C1 does hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

- After event6, event1 is allowed. Choose event1.
- After event1, event4 is allowed. Choose event4.

- C2 = (Event4) OR C1 = (Event4) OR (Event6) OR (Event7).

- The context states ""Initially, event6 happened."" So Event6 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- Since Event6 happens, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""Event4 or C1""; because C1 is true, C2 is true regardless of Event4.

Final answer:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The premises state ""Initially, event7 happened.""
- Also, the premises repeatedly state ""After event7, no other events can happen."" So once event7 occurs initially, no further events can occur.
- Therefore event7 occurs in every allowed sequence, and event1 cannot occur (since no events can follow event7).
- C1 (event1 does not happen) is true under these premises.
- Given that event7 happens (initially) in all models, the implication ""if event1 does not happen, then event7 happens"" is true. Hence C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: event1 does not happen.
- C2: if C1 holds then event7 happens.

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- The context says ""Initially, event7 happened.""
- It also says ""After event7, no other events can happen."" So the only event that occurs is event7; event1 does not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate the implication:
- In the actual (and only possible) sequence given, event7 does happen. An implication ""if C1 then event7"" is true whenever event7 is true (regardless of C1).
- Therefore C2 is true under the provided facts.

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event7 happened."" So event7 occurs.
- The context also states ""After event7, no other events can happen."" Therefore no further events (including event1) can occur after that initial event7.
- Thus in every allowed scenario described, event7 happens and event1 does not happen.
- Therefore the conditional ""If event1 does not happen, then event7 happens"" is satisfied (indeed event7 happens regardless). Hence C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning in brief:
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means event3 occurs in every allowed sequence from the start.
- C1 only asserts that event6 and event7 happen (in addition). In any sequence where C1 holds, event3 already happened initially.
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is always satisfied.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 is the implication: (event6 and event7) → event3.
- The context begins with ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 occurs (at least initially), regardless of whether event6 and event7 occur later.
- Therefore there is no possible situation consistent with the context in which event6 and event7 both happen but event3 does not — event3 already happened.
- Hence the implication is true.
---
True

Reasoning: The implication's consequent is ""event3 happens"". But the context says ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means event3 has already occurred in every possible sequence. Therefore any sequence in which C1 (event6 and event7 happen) holds also contains event3 (from the initial event). Hence ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is true."

False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Start: event6 happened.
- From event6, one allowed next event is event7 (6 → 7).
- From event7, one allowed next event is event3 (7 → 3).
- From event3, one allowed next event is event6 (3 → 6).
- Now we can loop 6 → 3 → 6 → 3 → ... indefinitely. In this loop we never take the transitions that lead to event5.

Thus there is a valid execution where event7 occurs but event5 never occurs afterwards. That falsifies C1 (the claim that if event7 happens then event5 happens), so C1 cannot be made to hold eventually. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the given rules: after event6, event7 is allowed; after event7, event1 is allowed.
- Starting at the initial event6, one possible trace is: event6 -> event7 -> event1. Here event7 occurred but was not followed by event5, so C1 (""if event7 happens then event5 happens"") is violated.
- Because the transition rules do not change, there will always be choices that violate C1 (e.g., choosing event1 after event7), so C1 does not become true later either.

Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event6 (given).
- From event6 you can go to event1, event4, or event7.
- If you choose event1, then from event1 you can go to event3 (one allowed continuation).
- Thus the sequence 6 -> 1 -> 3 is allowed, so event3 can occur.
- C1 asserts ""event3 happens or event2 happens."" The sequence above makes C1 true.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event3 nor event2 happens). Because there is a valid sequence in which event3 does happen, C2 is not true.

(There do exist sequences that avoid events 2 and 3, but that only shows C1 is not forced true in all runs. Since C1 can be true, C2 — the claim that C1 does not hold — is false.)
---

---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says: event3 happens or event2 happens.
- C2 is the negation: neither event3 nor event2 happens.
- From the context, after event6 we may have event1. After event1 we may have event3. So a possible sequence is 6 -> 1 -> 3, which makes C1 true.
- Because the rules permit a sequence where event3 occurs, C1 does not fail in all cases, so C2 (that neither event3 nor event2 happens) is not true."

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false. C1 says: Event7 happens and event6 happens. So C2 is true only if it's impossible for both event6 and event7 to occur following the rules starting from event5.

From the rules:
- Start: 5.
- 5 -> {2,3,4}
- 4 -> {5,6,7}
- 6 -> {1,4,5}
- 1 -> {3,4,6}
- 3 -> {7}

Construct a valid sequence that contains both 6 and 7:
5 -> 4 (allowed)
4 -> 6 (allowed)    — we have event6
6 -> 1 (allowed)
1 -> 3 (allowed)
3 -> 7 (allowed)    — we have event7

Thus there is a valid sequence starting at event5 that produces both event6 and event7. Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
You want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true given the rules. C1 says both event7 and event6 happen. We need to check whether it's possible (given the rules) that both 6 and 7 occur; if yes, C2 is not true.

Construct a valid sequence starting from the initial event5 that produces both 6 and 7:

- Start: 5 (given).
- From 5, choose 4 (allowed: after 5 → 2, 3, or 4).
- From 4, choose 6 (allowed: after 4 → 5, 6, or 7). Now event6 has happened.
- From 6, choose 1 (allowed: after 6 → 1, 4, or 5).
- From 1, choose 3 (allowed: after 1 → 3, 4, or 6).
- From 3, event7 must happen (after 3 → 7). Now event7 has happened.

This sequence 5 → 4 → 6 → 1 → 3 → 7 is consistent with all rules and includes both event6 and event7, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
False.

Reasoning:
- Start at event5 (given).
- From event5 choose event3 (allowed: after event5 → {2,3,4}).
- After event3 event7 must happen (3 → 7).
- After event7 choose event4 (7 → {2,4}).
- After event4 choose event6 (4 → {5,6,7}).

This yields the sequence 5 → 3 → 7 → 4 → 6, so both event7 and event6 happen. Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""event6 happens and event2 happens"".
- We are given that event6 has already happened initially, so the only way for C1 to hold is that event2 eventually occurs at some later point.
- The rules are nondeterministic (""either ... must happen""), so we must check whether event2 is forced on every possible continuation. If there exists a possible (infinite) sequence of events that never produces event2, then C2 is not guaranteed.
- Construct a valid repeating sequence that avoids event2:
  - Start: event6 (given).
  - After event6 choose event7 (allowed: after 6 → 4, 5, or 7).
  - After event7 choose event1 (allowed: after 7 → 1, 3, 4, or 6).
  - After event1 choose event6 (allowed: after 1 → 2, 5, 6, or 7).
  - Now repeat: 6 → 7 → 1 → 6 ...
- This cycle (6,7,1,6,...) never includes event2, and all steps respect the given ""after"" rules. Therefore it is possible to never see event2.
- Because event2 can be avoided indefinitely, C1 need not eventually hold, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 has occurred, so C1 (event6 and event2 both happen) reduces to ""event2 eventually happens"" (event6 already happened).
- From event6 the allowed next events are {event4, event5, event7}. From event4 the allowed next events include event6, so the sequence 6 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> ... is a valid infinite execution that never includes event2.
- Because there exists a valid execution that never produces event2, it is not guaranteed that event2 will eventually happen in every possible run.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not necessarily true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 has happened.
- From event6, one possible next event is event7 (rule: after event6 → event4, event5, or event7).
- From event7, one possible next event is event1 (rule: after event7 → event1, event3, event4, or event6).
- From event1, one possible next event is event2 (rule: after event1 → event2, event5, event6, or event7).

Thus there is a valid sequence 6 → 7 → 1 → 2, so event2 eventually occurs while event6 has occurred, so C1 holds at some future point. Therefore C2 is True."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Identify the claim:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this as a temporal property meaning that from some moment onward every event is event2 (i.e., event2 holds at every future step).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means there is some time after which C1 is true (i.e., eventually we reach a point from which all subsequent events are event2).

2. Examine the transition rules (deduplicated):
   - after event1 → {2,3,4,5,6}
   - after event2 → {1,3,6}
   - after event3 → {2,4,5}
   - after event4 → {1,3,6,7}
   - after event5 → {2,4}
   - after event6 → {2,3,4,5}
   - after event7 → {1,3,4,5,6}
   - initial event: event6 happened

3. To make C1 true at some point, we would need a state (time) such that every future event is event2. That requires an absorbing state where the only allowed successor is event2 (or the current and all future events are 2). Concretely, if C1 is to hold at time t, then for the event at time t the set of allowed next events must force event2 forever.

4. Check for such an absorbing 2-state:
   - after event2 the allowed successors are {1,3,6} — event2 is not even a possible immediate successor of event2, so you cannot have two consecutive event2s.
   - No other event has the unique successor {2}. Every state has at least one successor that is not event2.
   - Therefore there is no reachable time from which all subsequent events must be event2.

5. Conclusion: C1 never becomes true at any time, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., from some moment on every event is event2).
- From the rules: after event2 the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event6}. Event2 is not in that set, so you cannot have event2 followed by event2.
- Therefore there is no state from which every future event can be event2 (you cannot sustain event2 forever).
- Hence C1 can never hold, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.
---
Step 1 — what the claims mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this as the property that at every step the current event is event2 (i.e., the system's event is 2 at all times after the claim holds).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" There is some future time after which C1 is true (i.e., from that time onward every event is event2).

Step 2 — transitions summary (distinct rules)
- initial: event6 happened.
- 6 -> {2,3,4,5}
- 4 -> {1,3,6,7}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,6}
- 3 -> {2,4,5}
- 7 -> {1,3,4,5,6}
- 2 -> {1,3,6}
- 5 -> {2,4}

Step 3 — key observation
From event2 the next event must be one of {1,3,6}. None of those is 2. So it is impossible to have two consecutive event2 occurrences. Consequently you cannot reach a point after which every subsequent event is 2 (that would require 2 -> 2 or a state forcing 2 forever).

Step 4 — conclusion
C1 (""event2 always happens"") is never satisfied (it is already false at the start because the initial event is 6), and there is no future time after which all events are 2. Therefore C2 is false.

False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event5 does not happen (i.e., no occurrence of event5).
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is necessarily true given the transition rules and the initial event4.

Step 2 — relevant transitions (cleaned up)
- Start: event4 occurs initially.
- After event4 → {2, 6, 7}
- After event6 → {1, 3, 5, 7}
- After event1 → {2, 3, 4, 7}
- After event7 → {3, 4}
- After event3 → {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- After event2 → {1, 3, 6, 7}
- After event5 → no further events (terminal)

Step 3 — construct a counterexample path avoiding event5 and event2
Starting at the initial event4, choose transitions that avoid both 5 and 2:
- 4 → 6 (allowed)
- 6 → 1 (allowed)
- 1 → 4 (allowed)
This yields the cycle 4 → 6 → 1 → 4 → ... which can repeat indefinitely. This infinite path never visits event5 and never visits event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a valid sequence (starting from the initial event4) in which event5 does not happen and event2 also never happens, the implication “If event5 does not happen then event2 happens” is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
You ask whether ""If event5 does not happen (C1), then event2 happens"" (C2) is True or False.

Interpretation: C2 claims that in every valid event sequence starting from the initial event4, if event5 never occurs, then at some point event2 must occur.

Simplify the rules (duplicates removed):
- Start: event4.
- After 4 → {2, 6, 7}.
- After 2 → {1, 3, 6, 7}.
- After 1 → {2, 3, 4, 7}.
- After 3 → {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}.
- After 6 → {1, 3, 5, 7}.
- After 7 → {3, 4}.
- After 5 → terminal (no next events).

Counterexample sequence avoiding event5 and event2:
4 → 6 → 1 → 4 → 6 → 1 → 4 → ...
Each step is allowed by the rules and this cycle never includes event5 or event2. Thus it is possible that event5 does not happen while event2 also never happens.

Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is False.
---
We want to check the claim: If event5 never happens (C1), then event2 must happen (C2).

From the rules (deduplicated):
- Start: event4 happened.
- 1 -> {2,3,4,7}
- 2 -> {1,3,6,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,5,6,7}
- 4 -> {2,6,7}
- 5 -> terminal (no further events)
- 6 -> {1,3,5,7}
- 7 -> {3,4}

Assume C1: event5 does not occur. Remove all transitions to 5. The remaining allowed transitions become:
- 1 -> {2,3,4,7} (without 5 nothing changes)
- 2 -> {1,3,6,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,6,7}
- 4 -> {2,6,7}
- 6 -> {1,3,7}
- 7 -> {3,4}

Starting from the initial event4, we can follow a cycle that avoids both 5 and 2, for example:
4 -> 7 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 7 -> ...
Each step is allowed by the rules and never visits event5 or event2.

Thus C1 can hold while event2 never happens, so the implication in C2 is not guaranteed. C2 is False."

False

Counterexample (possible sequence consistent with the rules):
Start at event5 (given).
5 -> 1 (allowed: after 5, {1,3,4,7})
1 -> 3 (allowed: after 1, {3,6,7})
3 -> 5 (allowed: after 3, {4,5})
Repeat 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... forever.

This infinite path never contains event4 or event6, so C1 (event4 and event6 happen) does not always hold. Hence C2 is False.
---
We start at event5. Summarize unique transition rules (from the context):
- 5 → {1, 3, 4, 7}
- 6 → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- 1 → {3, 6, 7}
- 2 → {3}
- 3 → {4, 5}
- 4 → {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- 7 → {2}

C1 says: event4 happens and event6 happens. C2 says C1 always holds (i.e. in every possible execution path).

To refute C2 it is enough to exhibit a valid execution that avoids either event4 or event6 (or both). From the transitions we have this infinite loop:
5 → 7 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 2 → 3 → 5 → ...
Each step is permitted by the rules (5→7, 7→2, 2→3, 3→5). In this loop neither event4 nor event6 ever occurs. Therefore C1 does not hold on that execution, so C1 is not guaranteed in all runs.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
C2 says ""C1 always holds"", i.e. in every possible sequence (starting from the given initial event5) both event4 and event6 occur.

Look at the permitted transitions and produce a valid run that never contains event4 or event6:
- Start: event5 (given).
- 5 -> 7 is allowed.
- After 7, event2 must happen: 7 -> 2.
- After 2, event3 must happen: 2 -> 3.
- After 3, we may choose event5: 3 -> 5.

This yields the cycle 5 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... which is allowed by the rules and never includes event4 or event6. Hence C1 does not hold in all possible runs, so C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C1 simplifies to ""Event6 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same disjunct). C2 says ""Event6 eventually happens.""

From the initial event7, the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event6}. Although event6 can occur immediately (so there exists a run where C1 holds), it is not inevitable: choose event1 after event7, then choose event7 after event1, and repeat (7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → ...), and event6 never occurs. Thus event6 is not guaranteed to eventually happen on all possible runs.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event6 happens or event6 happens"", i.e. simply ""Event6 happens"".
- C2 says that event6 eventually happens on the execution starting from the initial event7.
- From event7 you may choose event1 (7 -> 1). From event1 you may choose event7 (1 -> 7). Repeating this choice yields the infinite path 7 -> 1 -> 7 -> 1 -> ... which never visits event6.
- Because there is a valid execution that avoids event6 forever, event6 is not guaranteed to eventually occur.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event6 happens or event6 happens"", which is just ""Event6 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Eventually Event6 happens"" (from the initial state).

Step 2 — examine the rules and trace possible sequences
- Initially event7 happened.
- From event7, the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event6}.
- To show C2 is not guaranteed, it is enough to exhibit a valid infinite execution that never reaches event6.

Counterexample execution avoiding event6:
- Start: event7.
- Choose event4 (allowed after event7).
- From event4, choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3, choose event4 (allowed).
- Repeat the cycle event4 → event3 → event4 → ... indefinitely.

All transitions used are permitted by the rules, and this infinite run never visits event6, so ""eventually event6"" does not necessarily hold.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 claims ""event2 eventually happens"" (i.e., that event2 must occur in the future).
- Start state: event3.
- From 3 you may choose 4. From 4 you may choose 1. From 1 you may choose 3. That yields the infinite cycle 3 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 → ...
- This cycle never visits event2 and is allowed by the given rules, so there exists a valid execution where event2 never happens.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in general, so C2 (the negation of C1) is True.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Start at event3. From event3 you can go to event4, event5, or event6.
- There is a path that reaches event2 (e.g. 3 -> 5 -> 2), so event2 is reachable (so an existential “eventually” would hold).
- However, the rules allow a cycle that avoids event2 indefinitely: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 ... (after 3 you can choose 4; after 4 choose 1; after 1 choose 3). This infinite loop never visits event2.
- Therefore “Event2 eventually happens” is not guaranteed in all possible executions, so C1 does not hold (under the natural universal reading of “eventually happens”), and hence C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event2 does not necessarily happen / event2 never has to happen)

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to a counterexample
- Initially: event3 happened.
- From event3: can go to 4, 5, or 6.
- From event6: can go to 5 or 7.
- From event7: can go to 1, 4, or 6.
- In particular, 6 -> 7 and 7 -> 6 are allowed transitions.

Step 3 — exhibit a valid infinite path avoiding event2
- Start at 3, choose 6 (3 -> 6 allowed).
- From 6 choose 7 (6 -> 7 allowed).
- From 7 choose 6 (7 -> 6 allowed).
- Repeat 6 -> 7 -> 6 -> 7 ... forever.
This infinite run never visits event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid behavior starting from the initial state that never leads to event2, C1 is not guaranteed and therefore C1 does not hold.
- So C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The system starts with event1.
- The listed rules give possible successors for events 1,2,3,5,6,7 and for 4 (what can follow 4), but there is no rule that ever produces event4 (no event has ""after it, event4"" as an option, and event4 is not initial).
- Therefore event4 can never occur in any execution starting from the given initial condition.
- C1 requires both event6 and event4 to happen. Even if event6 can occur in some traces, event4 cannot, so C1 does not hold.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (in all executions). That is false because C1 never holds (due to event4 being impossible).

Hence C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event6 happens and event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. in every possible execution from the initial condition, both event6 and event4 occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- Transitions:
  - After event1 → event2 or event3.
  - After event2 → event1 or event5 or event7.
  - After event3 → event5 or event6.
  - After event5 → event1 or event2 or event6.
  - After event6 → event5.
  - After event7 → event1 or event2.
  - After event4 → event3 or event5 or event6 or event7.
- Note: There is no rule whose result is event4 (no transition leads to event4).

Step 3 — reason about reachability:
- From the initial event1, you can reach event6 (e.g. 1 → 3 → 6, or 1 → 2 → 5 → 6), so event6 can occur.
- Event4, however, has no incoming transitions and is not the initial event, so event4 is unreachable and therefore cannot occur in any execution starting from the given initial state.

Conclusion:
- Because event4 cannot happen, the conjunction ""event6 happens and event4 happens"" (C1) cannot hold, so it certainly is not true that C1 always holds.

Final answer: False
---
C2 asserts that ""C1 always holds"", where C1 is ""event6 happens and event4 happens.""

1) From the given rules the only initially true event is event1.  
2) The transition rules mention events 1,2,3,5,6,7; there is exactly one rule involving event4 (“After event4, …”), but there is no rule that ever causes event4 to occur (no ""after X, event4 must/may happen"" and event4 is not initial). Therefore event4 is unreachable from the initial state.  
3) Because event4 cannot occur, any condition that requires event4 (such as C1) cannot always hold. (Even if event6 can occur in some runs, C1 requires both event6 and event4.)  
4) Hence C1 does not hold in all possible executions, so C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event7 happens and event2 happens (i.e., both occur).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible run starting from the initial situation, both event7 and event2 occur).
We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event5 has happened.
- After event5 there are two given rules: one allows {1,2,3,4,7} and another allows {2,4,6}. Both constraints apply, so the next event after event5 must belong to the intersection {2,4}.
- Other transition rules:
  - after 1 -> {2,3,4}
  - after 2 -> {4,6}
  - after 3 -> {1,4}
  - after 4 -> {1,3}
  - after 6 -> {1,2,3,4,7}
  - after 7 -> {1,2,6}

Step 3 — produce a counterexample run (to test ""always"")
- Start: 5
- Choose next = 4 (allowed since 4 ∈ {2,4}).
- 4 -> choose 1 (allowed).
- 1 -> choose 3 (allowed; avoid 2).
- 3 -> choose 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 ↔ 3 forever.

This infinite run 5,4,1,3,1,3,... never contains event2 and never contains event7, and it respects all transition constraints (choices at every step are allowed). Thus there exists a valid run in which C1 is false.

Conclusion
- C1 is not guaranteed in all runs, so C2 is False.

False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 says: event7 happens and event2 happens.
- C2 says: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible sequence consistent with the rules, both event7 and event2 occur).

Step 2 — examine the rules and possible transitions (summary):
- 5 -> {2,4,6}
- 4 -> {1,3}
- 1 -> {2,3,4}
- 3 -> {1,4}
- 2 -> {4,6}
- 6 -> {1,2,3,4,7}
- 7 -> {1,2,6}

Step 3 — produce a counterexample sequence that obeys the rules but avoids event2 and event7:
- Start: 5 (given).
- Choose 5 -> 4 (allowed).
- Choose 4 -> 1 (allowed).
- Choose 1 -> 3 (allowed).
- Choose 3 -> 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 <-> 3 forever.

This infinite trace (5,4,1,3,1,3,...) respects all ""after"" constraints at each step but never contains event2 or event7. Therefore C1 does not hold in every possible execution.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Start: event5 happened. From event5 we may choose event2 (since 5 -> {2,4,6}).
- Take the choices 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> ... repeating. These transitions are allowed by the rules:
  - 5 -> 2 (allowed),
  - 2 -> 4 (allowed),
  - 4 -> 1 (allowed),
  - 1 -> 2 (allowed),
  and the loop 2->4->1->2 can repeat indefinitely.
- In this valid run event2 occurs, but event7 never occurs. Therefore C1 (""event7 happens and event2 happens"") does not hold on all possible runs.
- So C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- From the rules we have transitions:
  7 → {3,4,5}
  3 → {5}
  4 → {2,6,7}
  5 → {2,7}
  2 → {1,6,7}
  1 → {3,5,7}
  6 → {2,3,7}

- We ask whether event6 is guaranteed to happen eventually (C1). If there exists any valid infinite event sequence that never visits 6, then C1 is not entailed.

- Construct a cycle that avoids 6: 7 → 4 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 7, and then repeat. At each choice we deliberately avoid the transitions to 6 (e.g. from 4 choose 2 or 7, from 2 choose 1 or 7, etc.). This yields a valid infinite path in which event6 never occurs.

- Therefore C1 (""event6 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed (false). The disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event6 happens"") is not guaranteed either, because neither disjunct is entailed by the rules. Hence C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event6 eventually happens."" C2: ""C1 holds or event6 happens"" — which is effectively equivalent to C1 in this setting (the disjunct ""event6 happens"" does not add anything that C1 doesn't cover).
- From the rules we have transitions:
  7 -> {3,4,5}
  3 -> {5}
  5 -> {2,7}
  4 -> {2,6,7}
  2 -> {1,6,7}
  1 -> {3,5,7}
  6 -> {2,3,7}
- Starting at 7, one possible (allowed) infinite sequence is 7 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> ... This cycle never visits event6.
- Because there exists an allowed execution where event6 never occurs, ""event6 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, and thus C2 is not guaranteed either.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Start: event7 happens.
- From 7 we can have event3. From 3 we must have event5. From 5 we can return to event7. That yields the cycle 7 → 3 → 5 → 7.
- This cycle can repeat indefinitely and never visits event6. Hence there exists a possible future where event6 never happens, so C1 (""event6 eventually happens"") is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event6 happens."" Since there is a possible run where neither C1 nor event6 occurs, C2 is not guaranteed and is therefore false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Hypothesis C2 requires that event3, event7, and event5 all occur (C2 = C1 and event5, where C1 = event3 and event7).

Start: initially event6 happened.
- After event6 the rules allow event1 or event7. Choose event1.
- After event1 the rules allow event2, event3, event4, or event6. Choose event3.
- After event3 the rules allow event1, event2, event4, or event5. Choose event5.
- After event5 the rules allow event3, event4, event6, or event7. Choose event7.

This sequence 6 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 7 is allowed by the given rules and contains event3, event5, and event7. Therefore C2 can be satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
We start with event6 (given). From the rules:
- After event6 the next event can be either event1 or event7.
- After event7 the next event can be event1, event2, event3, or event6.
- After event3 the next event can be event1, event2, event4, or event5.

One valid sequence is: 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5. This sequence is allowed by the rules and contains event7, event3, and event5, so C1 (event3 and event7) holds and event5 also occurs. Therefore C2 can be satisfied.

True

True

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happened.
- After event6 either event1 or event7 must happen. Choose event7.
- After event7 one of event1, event2, event3, or event6 must happen. Choose event3.
- After event3 one of event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen. Choose event5.

This yields a valid sequence 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 in which event3, event7, and event5 all occur. Therefore C2 can be satisfied."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., at every step / in all future transitions).
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds"" — both must be true.

Step 2 — examine the rules and produce counterexamples
- From the initial fact: event7 happens, and after event7 event6 must happen. So one possible path is:
  7 -> 6 -> 7 -> 6 -> 7 -> ... (always choose, after 6, event7). This infinite run contains no event4, so event4 is not guaranteed. Thus ""Event4 happens"" is not guaranteed.
- To show C1 fails: there is also a path that avoids repeating event7:
  7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> ... (from 2 you can always choose 4, from 4 choose 2). This infinite run contains event7 only initially, and then no further event7 — so event7 does not ""always happen"" at every step.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because you can choose transitions that avoid event4 and you can choose transitions that avoid repeated occurrences of event7, C1 is not guaranteed and event4 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 (""Event4 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event7 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 needs both C1 and Event4 to be true.

Step 2 — summarize the relevant rules
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7 → event6 must happen.
- After event6 → either event3 or event7.
- After event3 → one of {event4, event5, event6, event7}.
- After event4 → one of {event2, event3, event6}.
- After event2 → one of {event4, event7}.
- After event5 → one of {event3, event4, event6}.
(Other repetitions in the context are the same rules restated.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the initial event7 we must go to event6.
- From event6 we may choose event7. If we choose event7, we then must go to event6, and so on.
- Thus there is a valid infinite trace: 7 → 6 → 7 → 6 → 7 → 6 … which never includes event4.
- That trace still contains event7 (indeed initially and repeatedly), so any interpretation that requires event7 to occur at least once is satisfied, but event4 does not occur in that trace.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Because there exists a valid evolution that never produces event4, ""Event4 happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 (which requires Event4) is not entailed by the rules.
Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The rules define possible successors after each event; initially event7 happens.
- From event7 the only allowed next event is event6; from event6 the allowed next events are event3 or event7.
- Therefore one valid infinite trace is: 7 → 6 → 7 → 6 → 7 → 6 → ... (always choosing 7 after 6 and 6 after 7).
- In that trace event4 never occurs, so ""Event4 happens"" is not guaranteed.
- Because C2 requires both ""Event4 happens"" and C1, C2 can be false (we exhibited a valid sequence where it is false).

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurs.
- After event5 the next event must be event1 or event4 — event5 is not allowed immediately after event5.
- For ""Event5 always happens"" (C1) to eventually hold, there would need to be a time after which every step is event5 (i.e., event5 at every transition), which requires event5 to be able to follow event5.
- Because the rules forbid event5 immediately following event5, C1 can never become true at any later point.
Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e., every step/event is event5).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there is some future point after which every event is event5).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (relevant ones):
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be either event1 or event4 (so event5 cannot occur immediately again).
- Check all events' allowed successors: none of the events have the sole successor {event5}. E.g. event1 -> {2,5,7}; event2 -> {1,4,5}; event3 -> {2,5,6,7}; event4 -> {1,2,3,5,7}; event5 -> {1,4}; event6 -> {3,5}; event7 -> {2,6}.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 would require every event from some point onward to be event5. But since after event5 the next event cannot be event5 (it must be 1 or 4), there is no way to have two consecutive event5s.
- More generally, no state forces only event5 next (no state has successor set = {5}), so it's impossible to reach a point after which every future event is necessarily event5.

Conclusion:
- C1 cannot hold now or eventually, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- C1 reads as ""event5 always happens"" (i.e. from some point onward every step is event5, or in temporal logic: G event5).
- C2 reads as ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future time it becomes true that event5 holds forever; temporal: F G event5).

Look at the transition rules: after event5 the next event must be either event1 or event4 — event5 cannot follow immediately after event5. Therefore it is impossible to have a suffix of the run where every state is event5 (you cannot have two consecutive event5s, so you cannot have event5 at every future step).

Thus there is no time after which event5 holds at every step, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Hypothesis C2 asserts: ""Event6 does not happen, and event7 happens."" We must decide if C2 is forced by the given rules starting from initial event2.

Key rules (from the context):
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2 → either event1 or event4.
- After event1 → either event3, event6, or event7.
(Other rules are present but not needed for the counterexample.)

Counterexample trace showing C2 need not hold:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Choose after event2: event1 (allowed).
- Choose after event1: event6 (allowed).

This sequence makes event6 happen, so C1 (""event6 does not happen"") is false, and therefore C2 is false in this possible execution. Because there exists at least one valid sequence of events consistent with the rules where C2 is false, C2 is not guaranteed.

Answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify goal
- C2 asserts: (event6 does not happen) AND (event7 happens).

Step 2 — examine rules and start point
- Initially event2 happens.
- From event2 → either event1 or event4 must happen.
- From event1 → either event3, event6, or event7 must happen.
- From event4 → one of {1,2,6,7} must happen.
- From event7 → one of {2,3,6} must happen.
- No rule forces an event to ever be 6; 6 only appears as an option after 1,4,7 and 6 itself would lead to {1,7}.

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence satisfying C2
- Start: event2 (given).
- From event2 choose event1.
- From event1 choose event7.
This yields a sequence 2 → 1 → 7 in which event7 occurs and event6 has not occurred. After 7 you can choose 2 or 3 (avoiding 6) and continue without ever taking 6.

Step 4 — conclusion
- There is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event6 never happens and event7 does happen. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Start: event2 happened.
- After event2, choose event1 (allowed).
- After event1, choose event7 (allowed).
Thus event7 occurs and event6 has not occurred so far. After event7 one can always choose event2 or event3 (both allowed) to avoid event6, so there is a valid execution in which event6 never happens while event7 does. Therefore C2 is satisfiable (True)."

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event2 does not happen."" C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 asserts ""Event2 does happen.""
- Initially event1 occurs. From event1 the allowed next events are {event2, event4, event5}.
- To avoid event2, choose event4. From event4 the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event7}.
- Choosing event1 from event4 yields the cycle 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... which never includes event2 and respects all given ""after"" rules.
- Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which event2 never happens, C1 can hold, so C2 (the claim that event2 does happen) is not guaranteed/true.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- From the context, the allowed successors are:
  - 1 -> {2,4,5}
  - 2 -> {1,5,7}
  - 3 -> {2,6}
  - 4 -> {1,3,7}
  - 5 -> {4,6}
  - 6 -> {1,2,3,5,7}
  - 7 -> {1,2}
- Initially event1 happened.
- To show C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. event2 happens) is not forced, it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence that never uses event2.
- One such valid cycle that avoids event2:
  1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> ...
  (1->4 allowed, 4->3 allowed, 3->6 allowed, 6->5 allowed, 5->4 allowed, and the cycle repeats; none of these steps require event2.)
- Because there is a valid execution in which event2 never happens, C1 (""event2 does not happen"") can hold; therefore C2 (the negation) is not true.

Thus C2 is False.

C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- From the input, the transitions are:
  - 1 -> {2,4,5}
  - 2 -> {1,5,7}
  - 3 -> {2,6}
  - 4 -> {1,3,7}
  - 5 -> {4,6}
  - 6 -> {1,2,3,5,7}
  - 7 -> {1,2}
- Initially event1 happened. From 1 you may choose 4 (since 1 -> {2,4,5}).
- From 4 you may choose 1 (since 4 -> {1,3,7}).
- Thus the sequence 1,4,1,4,... is valid and never includes event2.

Therefore event2 does not have to happen (C1 can hold), so C2 (“C1 does not hold”, i.e. event2 does happen) is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start with the given initial event: event4 happened.
- After event4, one allowed next event is event1 (since 4 -> {1,2,3,6}).
- After event1, one allowed next event is event5 (since 1 -> {2,4,5,6}).
- After event5, event1 must happen (5 -> 1).
- From that event1 we can again choose event5 (1 -> 5). So we can loop: 4 → 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ... indefinitely.
- In this sequence event5 occurs, yet event6 never occurs.

Thus C1 (""If event5 happens, then event6 happens"") does not always hold, and so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 is: ""If event5 happens, then event6 happens."" So C2 says: in every allowed run, whenever event5 occurs at some time, event6 will occur at some later time.

Step 1 — interpret the rules:
- Initially: event4.
- After 6 → must 5.
- After 5 → must 1.
- After 1 → one of {2,4,5,6}.
- After 2 → one of {1,5}.
- After 4 → one of {1,2,3,6}.
- After 3 → one of {1,2,4,5,6}.
- After 7 → one of {1,2,3,4}.

Step 2 — check whether event5 can occur without any later event6 (i.e., counterexample to C1):

Construct an allowed (infinite) run that includes event5 but never includes event6 afterwards:

1. Start: 4 (given).
2. 4 → 1 (allowed because after 4 one option is 1).
3. 1 → 5 (allowed because after 1 one option is 5).
   Now event5 has occurred.
4. After 5 → 1 (forced).
5. After 1 → 2 (choose 2; allowed).
6. After 2 → 5 (choose 5; allowed).
7. Repeat steps 4–6 or move among {1,2,4,5,3} always choosing successors that are not 6.

All chosen transitions are permitted by the rules, and at every choice we deliberately avoid picking 6. None of the rules force 6 eventually — whenever a state lists 6 as an option it also lists other options, so we can continue indefinitely without ever taking 6.

Thus there exists a valid run where event5 occurs and no event6 ever occurs afterwards. That falsifies C1, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 is ""If event5 happens, then event6 happens.""

Interpretation: C1 claims that whenever event5 occurs, event6 inevitably happens (at some point afterward). We must check whether every valid sequence allowed by the rules that contains event5 must also contain event6 later.

Given rules (key ones):
- Initially event4.
- After event5, event1 must happen.
- After event1, one of {event2, event4, event5, event6} happens.

Construct a valid sequence that contains event5 but never contains event6:
- Start: event4 (given).
- Choose after event4 -> event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose -> event5 (allowed). Now event5 has happened.
- After event5 -> event1 (forced).
- From event1 choose -> event5 again (allowed).
Repeat the last two steps forever: ... -> event1 -> event5 -> event1 -> event5 -> ...
This is a valid infinite trace that contains event5 repeatedly but never contains event6, because at each choice after event1 we always choose event5 instead of event6.

Since such a valid sequence exists where event5 occurs but event6 never occurs, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in all cases. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., Event3 does NOT happen in the next state)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event4 happened.
- The rule after event4: ""either event1, event3, event5, or event6 must happen."" That allows event3 but does not force it uniquely; event1, event5, or event6 are also possible next events.
- No other rule eliminates those alternatives before the next state.

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- From the information given, the next state after event4 could be event3, but it could equally be event1, event5, or event6.
- Therefore we cannot conclude that Event3 necessarily happens in the next state (C1 is not entailed). C1 is possible but not guaranteed.

- C1 does not hold as a logical consequence of the premises, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule after event4 allows next state to be one of {event1, event3, event5, event6}. That means event3 is a possible next event but not the only allowed one.
- Since the next state could be event1, event5, or event6 instead, event3 does not necessarily happen in the next state. Hence C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule after event4 allows next state to be event1, event3, event5, or event6.
- Event3 is only one possible next event, not forced.
- Therefore ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (C1) does not necessarily hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The context repeatedly states ""after event7, event6 must happen,"" so the next state after the initial state is event6.
- C1 asserts ""event2 or event7 happens."" In the next state we have event6, which is neither event2 nor event7.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.

False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 holds.
- The rules say: after event7, event6 must happen. So the immediate next state is event6.
- C1 requires that in that next state either event2 or event7 happens. But the next state is event6 (neither event2 nor event7).
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event7 happens.""
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., after one transition).
- Initially event7 happened. The rules state that after event7, event6 must happen. So the immediate next state is event6.
- In that next state event6 occurs, which is neither event2 nor event7, so C1 is false in the next state.

Reasoning:
- Start: event3 happened, so the next state is one of {event4, event5, event6}.
- C2 asserts that from that next state, event4 will eventually happen on every possible future path.
- Consider the next state = event5. From the rules: 5 -> {1,2,7} and 1 -> {5,6}. So there is a valid infinite trace 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ... that never visits event4.
- Because there exists a next-state choice (event5) that admits a path avoiding event4 forever, event4 is not guaranteed to eventually occur from the next state. Therefore C2 is false.

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether ""If event5 eventually happens, then event6 happens"" is always true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens.
- From event2, one possible next event is event5.
- From event5, event3 is allowed, and after event3 no further events can happen.
- So there is a valid sequence: event2 → event5 → event3, in which event5 does happen but event6 never occurs.

Because there exists a valid run where C1 holds (event5 happens) but event6 does not, the implication C2 is false.

Answer: False
---
We need to evaluate whether ""If event5 eventually happens (C1), then event6 happens"" is necessarily true.

1. List relevant transitions:
- After event2 → event5 or event6.
- After event5 → event1 or event2 or event3 or event4.
- After event3 → no further events (terminal).
- (Other transitions exist but aren't needed for the counterexample.)

2. Find a run where C1 holds but event6 never occurs:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Choose event2 → event5 (so C1 holds).
- Then choose event5 → event3.
- Event3 is terminal, so no further events can happen; in particular, event6 does not occur.

This run shows event5 can happen without any eventual occurrence of event6. Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event6 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 says: ""If event5 eventually happens (C1), then event6 happens.""
- From the context, after event2 the system can go to event5 or event6. After event5, one possible next event is event3, and event3 is terminal (no further events).
- Construct a valid sequence: event2 → event5 → event3. In this run, C1 holds (event5 happens) but event6 never happens.
- Because there exists a possible execution where C1 is true and event6 does not occur, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event6 happens.""
We must decide whether C2 is necessarily true given the rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to the immediate next state
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be one of: event2, event3, or event5.
So the next state could be event5 (making C1 true), but it could also be event2 or event3.

Step 3 — find a counterexample trace where C2 is false
We need a possible timeline consistent with the rules where neither C1 nor event6 ever holds.

Take this valid trace:
- Start: event1 (given).
- Next (immediate): choose event3 (allowed by ""after event1, either event2, event3, or event5"").
  - This makes C1 false (the next state is event3, not event5).
- After event3, event5 must happen (rule: after event3, event5 must happen).
- After event5, choose event3 again (allowed by ""after event5, either event1, event3, or event4"").
- This yields the cycle ... -> event3 -> event5 -> event3 -> event5 ... and no rule forces event6 anywhere in this cycle.

Thus we have a model consistent with all rules where:
- C1 is false (next state from the initial is event3), and
- event6 never occurs.

Therefore C2 (C1 or event6) is not guaranteed true.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1, the next event can be event2, event3, or event5.
- Take the branch where the next event is event3. Then by the rule ""after event3, event5 must happen"", the following sequence is 1 → 3 → 5.
- After event5 we can choose event1, so one possible infinite run is 1 → 3 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 5 → ... This run obeys all given rules and never contains event6.
- In that run, C1 (""event5 happens in the next state"") is false at the initial moment (the next state after the initial 1 is event3, not event5), and event6 never happens. Hence C2 (C1 or event6) is false in this model.
- Because a valid model exists where C2 is false, C2 is not necessarily true.

Therefore the correct answer is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened. From ""After event1, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen,"" the immediate next state can be event2, event3, or event5.
- C2 claims: (event5 in the next state) OR (event6 in the next state).
- Consider the allowed next state = event3. That is consistent with the rules. In that next state event3 occurs (not event5 or event6). Although after event3 event5 must happen, that occurs one step later, not in the immediate next state.
- Thus there is a permitted scenario where neither event5 nor event6 happens in the next state, so C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened. The rules say: ""After event2, either event1, event4, or event7 must happen."" So the immediate next event must be one of {event1, event4, event7}.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is false.
- Since event3 is not in the allowed next-events after event2, event3 does not happen next either.
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" — both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts “Event2 happens in the next state.” From the context, after event2 the only possible next events are event1, event4, or event7. Event2 cannot follow itself, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts “Event3 happens or C1 holds” (in the next state). After event2 the next state cannot be event3 (allowed nexts are only 1, 4, or 7), and we already established C1 is false. Thus both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, either event1, event4, or event7 must happen"" means event2 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- Event3 is not among the allowed successors of event2, so event3 cannot happen in the next state either.
- Therefore ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1 is the claim ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens"" — i.e. a disjunction that in effect asserts event5 happens (since C1 asserts event5 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — use the context rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be either event2 or event4 (rule: after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen).

Step 3 — produce a counterexample to C1 (and thus to C2)
- If after the initial event1 the next event is event2, then event5 does not occur in that next state (the rule after event2 allows event5, event6, or event7, but it does not force event5 in the immediate next state — the immediate next state is event2).
- Thus C1 (""event5 happens in the next state"") can be false (take the next state = event2).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 can be false and the disjunction adds only ""event5 happens"" (which is the same event), C2 is not guaranteed true either.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the given information.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event2, or event4 must happen"" forces the next state to be either event2 or event4.
- Therefore event5 does not happen in the next state, so C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens"" — both disjuncts refer to event5 happening in the next state, so both are false. Hence C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened. The rules say: after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. So event5 cannot be the very next event. Thus C1 (""event5 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" For C2 to be true it would have to be guaranteed that event5 happens (either immediately or inevitably later).
- But event5 is not inevitable. For example, pick the choices: event1 -> event2 -> event6 -> event1 -> event2 -> event6 ... This infinite loop follows all given rules and never produces event5. Hence event5 does not have to occur.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the context.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""Event4 happens and C1 holds"") is True or False. Step-by-step:

1. Identify hypotheses:
   - C1: Event6 always happens (i.e., in every possible future sequence, event6 occurs at some point).
   - C2: Event4 happens AND C1 holds.

2. Model the transitions (from the context):
   - Start: event3.
   - 1 -> {2,3,4,5,6,7}
   - 2 -> {1,3,7}
   - 3 -> {1,2,5,7}
   - 4 -> {1,5,6,7}
   - 5 -> {6,7}
   - 6 -> {1,3,4,7}
   - 7 -> {1,2,4}

3. Check C1 (event6 always happens). From the start (3) there is a choice 3 -> 1, and 1 -> 2, and 2 -> 1, so we can loop 1 <-> 2 (or 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...), never taking any transition to event6. Thus there exists a valid infinite sequence that never includes event6. Therefore C1 is false (event6 is not guaranteed to happen).

4. Since C2 requires C1 to hold (and C1 is false), C2 is false regardless of whether event4 can happen.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event6 always happens"" — i.e. in every possible continuation from the initial state, event6 will occur.
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds"" — both event4 occurs (in at least one continuation? or necessarily; here C1 is a universal claim) and event6 always happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the transition rules and the initial event3.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition
- Initial event: event3.
- From event3: next ∈ {event1, event2, event5, event7}.
- From event1: next ∈ {event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7}.
- From event2: next ∈ {event1, event3, event7}.
- From event5: next ∈ {event6, event7}.
- From event6: next ∈ {event1, event3, event4, event7}.
- From event7: next ∈ {event1, event2, event4}.
(Several rules were repeated in the context but these are the effective transitions.)

Step 3 — check C1 (event6 always happens)
- We only need one possible infinite sequence that avoids event6 to show C1 is false.
- Construct such a sequence: start at event3 → choose event2 → choose event1 → choose event2 → choose event1 → ... This 3 ↔ 2 ↔ 1 ↔ 2 cycle can be continued indefinitely because:
  - From event3 we can go to event2.
  - From event2 we can go to event1.
  - From event1 we can go back to event2.
- None of these choices require event6; we can always pick the next event to stay in {event1,event2,event3} and never visit event6.
- Therefore event6 is not guaranteed to occur in all possible continuations. C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 asserts event4 happens and C1 holds. Because C1 is false, C2 cannot be true.
- (Even ignoring C1, event4 is not forced either — there exist continuations that never reach event4.)

Final answer:
False
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event4 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event6 always happens"") is true given the transition rules and initial event3.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3 the allowed next events are {1,2,5,7}.
- To show C1 (""event6 always happens"") is false it suffices to exhibit a valid infinite (or arbitrarily long) run from the start that never hits event6.
- Consider the cycle 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3:
  - 3 -> 2 is allowed.
  - 2 -> 1 is allowed.
  - 1 -> 3 is allowed.
  - Repeating this cycle indefinitely never visits event6 (nor event4).
- Thus event6 is not inevitable; C1 is false.
- C2 requires that C1 holds (and that event4 happens). Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true.

True

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event7 occurs, so by the rule after event7, event2 must happen. So one possible prefix is 7 → 2.
- After event2, we may choose event3 (rule: after event2, either event3 or event5 must happen). So extend the trace: 7 → 2 → 3.
- After event3, the rule allows either event1 or event2. We can choose event1, giving 7 → 2 → 3 → 1. Here event3 is followed by event1, not event2.
- Therefore the universal claim C1 (""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"") does not hold (there is a valid trace where event3 occurs but is followed by event1). Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

False

Reasoning summary:
- Start at event3. From 3 you can go to 6 (since 3 -> {1,5,6,7}).
- From 6 you can go to 5 (6 -> {5,7}).
- From 5 you can go to 2 (5 -> {1,2}).
- From 2 you can go back to 6 (2 -> {1,4,5,6,7}).

This yields the infinite cycle 3 → 6 → 5 → 2 → 6 → 5 → 2 → ... that never visits event1. Therefore ""Event1 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed, so C1 does not necessarily hold, and C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The rules give possible successors for each event. From event3 (the initial event) the non-1 successors are {5,6,7}.
- Inspecting the graph restricted to nodes that are not event1, we find a cycle 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3:
  - 3 can go to 6,
  - 6 can go to 7,
  - 7 can go to 3.
- That cycle avoids event1 entirely, so there exists an infinite behavior starting from the initial event3 that never visits event1.
- Therefore ""Event1 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed, and C1 is not inevitably true; hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether C2 (""C1 holds or event6 happens"") is guaranteed by the rules. Note C1 = (event5 and event6), so C2 is true exactly when event6 happens (because if event6 happens C2 holds, and if C1 holds then event6 holds).

We only need one allowed execution that never contains event6 to show C2 is not guaranteed. Starting from the initial event1, the rules allow this cycle with no event6:
1 -> 4 (after event1 choose event4)
4 -> 3 (after event4 event3 must happen)
3 -> 5 (after event3 choose event5)
5 -> 2 (after event5 choose event2)
2 -> 1 (after event2 choose event1)

This returns to event1 and can repeat indefinitely without ever taking any transition to event6. Thus event6 is not forced, C1 does not hold (event6 absent), and so C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
First note C2 ≡ (event5 and event6) or event6, which simplifies to just event6. So C2 is true exactly when event6 must happen.

From the rules, start at event1. One possible non-6 path is:
1 → 4 (after 1 choose 4),
4 → 3 (forced),
3 → 5 (choose 5, avoid 6),
5 → 4 (choose 4),
4 → 3 (forced),
and the 3→5→4→3 cycle can repeat forever.

This sequence never requires event6, so event6 is not inevitable. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 holds or event6 happens"") follows from the context.

First simplify: C1 = (event5 and event6). So C2 = C1 or event6 is equivalent to just ""event6 happens"" (since C1 implies event6).

So question reduces to: Must event6 inevitably happen given the initial event and the ""after"" rules?

From the start: event1 occurs. After event1 we can have event4 or event5.

There is a cycle that never reaches event6:
- event1 -> event5 (allowed)
- event5 -> event4 (allowed)
- event4 -> event3 (forced)
- event3 -> event5 (allowed)
and then repeat 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> ...
None of these steps produces event6. Because at each nondeterministic choice we can pick the successor that avoids event6, we can indefinitely avoid event6.

Therefore event6 is not guaranteed, so C2 does not follow from the context.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event6 happens, so C1 (""event6 or event1"") is already true.
- C2 requires event3 to happen (and C1 to hold).
- From event6 one allowed next event is event4. From event4 one allowed next event is event6. From event6 again you may choose event4, and so on.
- Thus there is a valid sequence (event6 → event4 → event6 → event4 → ...) that never produces event3.
- Because event3 is not guaranteed in all possible sequences, C2 is not entailed by the given conditions.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event6 or event1 happens."" The context states initially event6 happened, so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""event3 happens and C1 holds."" So we need event3 to necessarily happen after the initial event6.
- From event6 the allowed next events are event3, event4, or event7. It is not forced to pick event3; we can pick event4 instead.
- From event4 the allowed next events are event2, event6, or event7. We can pick event6.
- This yields a valid infinite loop 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 → ... that never includes event3. Nothing in the rules forces us out of that loop into event3.
- Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to occur, so C2 (which requires event3) is not necessarily true.
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") follows from the given constraints.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event6 happens or Event1 happens. Since Event6 happens initially, C1 is true.
- C2: Event3 happens and C1 holds. So C2 is equivalent here to “Event3 necessarily happens” (because C1 already holds).

Step 2 — examine the rules and trace possible sequences:
- Start: Event6 happened.
- After 6: one of {3, 4, 7} must occur.
  - If we ever pick 3 (or pick 7, which forces 3), then Event3 happens and C2 would hold.
  - But we are allowed to pick 4 instead. After 4: one of {2, 6, 7} must occur.
    - From 4 we can pick 6 again. Then from 6 we can pick 4 again, etc.

Step 3 — counterexample execution:
- The infinite sequence 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 → ... is allowed by the rules and never contains Event3 (we always avoid choosing 3 or 7).
- Thus Event3 is not forced by the constraints; it is avoidable.

Conclusion:
- C1 is true (Event6 happened initially), but Event3 does not necessarily happen. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the allowed next events are only event1 or event7 (not event6).
- Therefore C1 (""event6 happens in the next state"") is already false for the initial step.
- Since C1 does not hold in that reachable case, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event6 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, the next event is event6).

Step 2 — examine the given transitions (condensed)
- After event3: next ∈ {event1, event7}.
- After event5: next ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,7}.
- After event1: next ∈ {2,4,7}.
- After event2: next ∈ {1,3,5,7}.
- After event4: next = {2}.
- After event6: next ∈ {1,3,5,7}.
- After event7: next ∈ {1,3,4,5}.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- The initial event is event3.
- From event3 the allowed next events are only event1 or event7; event6 is not allowed as the immediate next event.
- Therefore C1 (""event6 happens in the next state"") is false at the initial state.
- Since C1 is not even true in the initial step, C2 (""C1 always holds"") cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 is ""Event6 happens in the next state.""

Initial condition: event3 happened. From the transition rules, after event3 the next event must be either event1 or event7 (3 -> {1,7}). Neither of those is event6, so C1 is false in the initial state. Since C2 asserts C1 holds in all states, and we have a counterexample (the initial state), C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. Event4 does happen.

We ask whether C2 is true (i.e. whether Event4 must happen).

Construct a valid event sequence consistent with the rules that never includes event4:
- Start: event3 (given).
- 3 → 7 (must).
- From 7 choose event1 (7 → 1).
- From 1 choose event2 (1 → 2) to avoid 4.
- From 2 choose event6 (2 → 6) to avoid 3/4.
- From 6 choose event1 (6 → 1).
Now 1 → 2 → 6 → 1 can repeat indefinitely, and every choice above respected the allowed successors while avoiding event4. Thus there is a valid infinite path in which event4 never occurs.

Because it is possible (consistent with the context) that event4 does not happen, C1 can hold, so C2 (the negation) is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start: 3 → 7 (given).
- From 7 we can choose 1 (7 → 1).
- From 1 choose 2 (1 → 2) rather than 4.
- From 2 choose 6 (2 → 6) rather than 3 or 4.
- From 6 choose 1 (6 → 1) rather than 3.

This gives a cycle 1 → 2 → 6 → 1 that avoids event4 entirely. Thus it is possible for event4 never to occur (C1 can hold), so the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not forced true. Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 says ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. that Event4 does happen.

From the rules: initially event3 occurs, and after event3 event7 must happen. After event7 one allowed next event is event3. So we can choose the sequence 3 → 7 → 3 → 7 → ... indefinitely, never taking any transition to event4.

Thus Event4 need not ever occur, so C1 (Event4 does not happen) can hold, and C2 (that C1 does not hold) is not forced. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — restate C2
- C1 = (event3 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2 = (if event3 happens then C1 holds) ≡ (event3 ⇒ event2) (since event3 ⇒ event3 is trivial).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event7 must happen.
- After event7, one of {event1, event2, event5, event6} must happen — event2 is only one of several options, not forced.
- No rule forces event2 to occur eventually; only allows it as a choice in some transitions.

Step 3 — exhibit a valid sequence starting from event3 that never includes event2
- event3 → event7 (forced)
- event7 → event1 (allowed)
- event1 → event4 (allowed)
- event4 → event6 (allowed)
- event6 → event5 (allowed)
- event5 → event1 (allowed)
This loop can repeat indefinitely without ever choosing event2, and every transition respects the given rules.

Conclusion
- Event2 is not guaranteed whenever event3 happens, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — understand the hypothesis
- C1 = ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Logically, C2 is equivalent to: if event3 happens then event2 happens (since C1 already includes event3).

Step 2 — examine the rules and find a counterexample if possible
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event7 must happen.
- After event7, one of {event1, event2, event5, event6} must happen. We can choose event1 (avoiding event2).
- After event1, one of {event2, event4} must happen. Choose event4 (still avoiding event2).
- After event4, one of {event1, event5, event6} must happen. Choose event6.
- After event6, one of {event1, event2, event5, event7} must happen. Choose event7.
This yields a valid cycle: 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> ... that never includes event2. All choices respect the ""must happen"" options.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence starting from event3 that never yields event2, it is not guaranteed that event2 happens whenever event3 happens. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
C2 says: if event3 happens then (event3 and event2) — i.e. event3 implies event2.

From the context:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event7 must happen.
- After event7, one of {event1, event2, event5, event6} must happen.
- After event1, one of {event2, event4} must happen.
- After event4, one of {event1, event5, event6} must happen.

Counterexample (a permitted sequence that never produces event2):
event3 (initial) -> event7 (forced) -> event1 (allowed) -> event4 (allowed) -> event1 -> event4 -> ...  
This 1–4 cycle is allowed by the rules and never produces event2. Thus event2 is not guaranteed whenever event3 happens.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Start at event3 (given). From event3 one possible next event is event5.
- From event5 one possible next event is event2.
- After event2 no other events can happen (terminal). That concrete path is 3 → 5 → 2 and it never contains event4.
- Therefore event4 does not ""always happen"" (C1 is false), so the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 is ""Event4 always happens"", so C2 claims that event4 occurs on every possible run given the rules.

Interpretation: starting from the initial event3, the ""after"" rules give nondeterministic choices of next events. To show C1 (and thus C2) false it suffices to find one valid run where event4 never occurs.

Rules of interest (condensed):
- Initially event3.
- After event3: must do one of {4, 5, 6}.
- After event5: must do one of {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}.
- After event2: no further events (terminal).

Counterexample run:
- Start: event3 (initial).
- Choose event5 next (allowed by ""after event3"").
- From event5 choose event2 next (allowed by ""after event5"").
- After event2 there are no further events.

This run is 3 → 5 → 2 and contains no occurrence of event4. Therefore event4 does not always happen, so C1 is false, and hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start: event3 occurs.
- From event3 one allowed next is event5 (choices from event3 are 4, 5, or 6).
- From event5 one allowed next is event2 (choices from event5 include 2).
- After event2 no other events can happen.

This run 3 → 5 → 2 never includes event4, so ""Event4 always happens"" (C1) is false. Therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false."

Votes: {'False': 2, 'True': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Start: event4 has happened. The rules require that after event4, event2 must happen. So we have event4 → event2.

2. After event2, the rule is: either event1 or event6 must happen. This is a nondeterministic choice — we may pick event1 or event6.

3. After event1, the rule allows either event2, event3, or event6. So from event1 we can always choose event2 again.

4. Therefore there is a valid infinite trace that avoids both event6 and event5 entirely:
   event4 → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...,
   always picking event1 after event2 and event2 after event1. This respects every ""after"" rule and never produces event6 or event5.

5. Because such a valid trace exists in which event6 and event5 never occur, it is not guaranteed that ""event6 happens and event5 happens"" will eventually hold. C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is therefore not entailed.

Hence the correct answer is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C1 = ""Event6 happens and event5 happens"" (i.e., both events occur at some points).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — meaning that, from the initial state, eventually both event6 and event5 will occur.
We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given transition rules.

Step 2 — examine transitions (condensed):
- Start: 4 → 2 (must).
- 2 → {1, 6}.
- 1 → {2, 3, 6}.
- 3 → {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}.
- 5 → {1, 4, 6, 7}.
- 6 → {1, 4}.
- 7 → {1, 4}.

Step 3 — check possibility and necessity:
- Possibility: there exists a path with both 6 and 5, e.g. 4 → 2 → 6 → 1 → 3 → 5. So C1 can occur on some runs.
- Necessity (required for C2 to be true): C1 must occur on every possible run. But there is a run that avoids event5 forever: 4 → 2 → 6 → 4 → 2 → 6 → 4 ... (always choose 2 → 6 and 6 → 4). This infinite cycle contains event6 repeatedly but never event5, so C1 never holds on that run.

Conclusion:
Because there exists a valid execution that never reaches event5, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold. Therefore C2 is False.

False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: Both event6 and event5 occur.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., there is a future point at which both event6 and event5 have happened (so we ask whether this can be satisfied).

Step 2 — examine the transitions (condensed)
- 4 -> 2 (must)
- 2 -> {1, 6}
- 1 -> {2, 3, 6}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- 5 -> {1, 4, 6, 7}
- 6 -> {1, 4}
- 7 -> {1, 4}

Step 3 — construct a trace that satisfies C1
Starting from the required initial event4:
4 -> 2 (by rule)
2 -> 1 (choose)
1 -> 3 (choose)
3 -> 5 (choose)  — event5 has now happened
5 -> 6 (choose)  — event6 has now happened

So along the sequence 4,2,1,3,5,6 both event5 and event6 occur; thus C1 occurs eventually.

Conclusion

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is guaranteed by the rules given the initial event4.

Note C1 = (event1 or event3). So C2 = (C1 or event3) is logically equivalent to (event1 or event3). So the question is: must event1 or event3 occur on every possible run starting from the initial event4?

From event4 the rules allow either event1 or event7. If we ever take event1, C1 (and thus C2) is satisfied. But there is a valid alternative choice: from event4 choose event7, and from event7 choose event4, and repeat forever. That infinite run 4 → 7 → 4 → 7 → ... follows the allowed transitions (after 4 you may pick 7, after 7 you may pick 4) and never produces event1 or event3. (Event3 cannot occur unless event1 occurs first, so it cannot appear in that run.)

Because there exists a permitted run that avoids both event1 and event3 indefinitely, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1 = ""event1 happens or event3 happens"" (e1 ∨ e3).
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" = (e1 ∨ e3) ∨ e3, which simplifies to e1 ∨ e3. So C2 is equivalent to C1.

Step 2 — examine the event rules and initial condition
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 the next event can be event1 or event7.
- From event7 the next event can be event1 or event4.
- Event3 can only occur as a successor of event1 (no other rule produces event3).

Step 3 — produce a counterexample sequence
- Starting at event4, pick event7, then pick event4, then event7, etc.: 4 → 7 → 4 → 7 → ...
- This infinite sequence never includes event1 or event3.

Conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where neither event1 nor event3 ever happens, C1 (and therefore C2) is not guaranteed. So C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" Logically C2 = (event1 or event3) or event3 = event1 or event3, so C2 is equivalent to C1.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules from the initial state
- Initially event4 occurred.
- After event4 the next event must be event1 or event7.
- After event7 the next event must be event1 or event4.

Step 3 — show a counterexample execution
- From the initial event4 choose event7.
- From event7 choose event4.
- Repeat: 4 -> 7 -> 4 -> 7 -> ...
This infinite loop is allowed by the rules and never produces event1 or event3 (event3 only appears as a successor of event1, so it cannot appear if event1 never occurs).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is an allowed execution starting from the initial event4 that never produces event1 or event3, C1 is not guaranteed, hence C2 (equivalent to C1) is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event3 occurred. After event3 the next event can be one of {1,2,4,5,6,7} — event7 is possible but not forced.
- C2 says: ""in the next state, C1 holds"", i.e. in the next state the following state must be event7 (so two steps from now must be event7).
- Counterexample: pick the next event = event1 (allowed after event3). After event1 the next event can be {3,5,6}, none of which is guaranteed to be event7. Thus in that next state C1 need not hold.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event7 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., “Event7 happens in the next state”).
So C2 is just the claim that event7 occurs in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rules for after event3 say: the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event6, event7}.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- From event3, event7 is only one of several allowed next events. Nothing in the given rules forces event7 specifically; any of the listed options could occur.

Conclusion:
- We cannot conclude that event7 must happen in the next state, so C1 is not guaranteed, and therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We interpret:
- C1: ""Event7 happens in the next state"" (i.e., one step ahead).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state, event7 will happen in that state's next state — two steps ahead overall).

From the context: initially event3 happened. After event3, a next event may be 1,2,4,5,6, or 7. So event1 is a possible next-state event.

If at time1 event1 occurs, then after event1 the allowed next events are {3,5,6} — none is event7. Thus at that next state (time1) C1 (""event7 happens in the next state"") is false. Because a possible continuation exists where C1 fails, C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — simplify the hypotheses:
- C1 is ""event1 or event6"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1"", i.e. (event1 or event6) or event1, which simplifies to (event1 or event6). So C2 ≡ C1.

Step 2 — check whether C2 must hold given the rules:
Start: event5 occurs. Rule: after event5, event4 must happen. From event4 we may choose event3. From event3 we may choose event5 (because after event3 the options are event1, event5, or event6). Then after event5 we get event4 again. So there is a valid infinite cycle:
5 → 4 → 3 → 5 → 4 → 3 → ...
In this cycle neither event1 nor event6 ever occurs. Therefore C1 (and hence C2) is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is equivalent to (event1 ∨ event6) ∨ event1, i.e. event1 ∨ event6 (same as C1).

We can produce a valid sequence consistent with the rules that avoids both event1 and event6:
- Initially event5.
- After event5 → event4.
- From event4 choose event2.
- From event2 choose event3.
- From event3 choose event5.
This yields the cycle 5 → 4 → 2 → 3 → 5 → ... which never includes event1 or event6 and respects all ""after"" constraints.

Since a valid model exists where neither event1 nor event6 ever happens, C2 is not entailed. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — simplify the hypotheses:
- C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event6 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens). That simplifies to (event1) OR (event6) — i.e. C2 is equivalent to C1.

So we only need to decide whether event1 or event6 must happen in every allowed run.

Step 2 — exhibit a run that avoids both event1 and event6:
- Initially event5 happens (given).
- After event5, event4 must happen. So we have 5 → 4.
- From event4 we may choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 we may choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 we may choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 → event4 again, and the cycle 4 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 4 can repeat indefinitely.

This infinite loop never visits event1 or event6, and every step respects the given ""after X ..."" rules.

Conclusion:
Because there exists an allowed execution that never has event1 or event6, C1 is not guaranteed; therefore C2 (equivalent to C1) is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- The context states ""Initially, event6 happened."" So event6 is true in every allowed sequence.
- C1 says ""If event4 happens, then event6 happens."" Because event6 already happened initially, any sequence in which event4 occurs will still have event6 (from the initial event).
- A concrete allowed sequence with event4 is 6 -> 3 -> 4 (6 allows 3; 3 allows 4; after 4 nothing happens). That sequence has both event4 and event6.
- Therefore C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step, brief):
- Initially event6 happened — so every allowed execution contains event6.
- The only way to get event4 is via event3 (""After event3, either event4, event5, or event6 must happen""), and event3 can follow event6 (""After event6, either event2, event3, or event7 must happen""), so a sequence 6 → 3 → 4 is possible.
- Because event6 occurs initially in every trace, whenever event4 happens there is (already) an occurrence of event6.
- Thus C1 (""If event4 happens, then event6 happens"") holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false. That is, determine whether C1 (""If event4 happens, then event6 happens"") holds given the rules.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event6 has happened.
- The only rules that lead to event3 are ""after event6, either event2, event3, or event7 must happen."" No rule makes event3 follow any event other than event6. So any occurrence of event3 must be immediately after some event6 (i.e., a 6 occurs just before the 3).
- Event4 can only occur after event3 (""after event3, either event4, event5, or event6 must happen""). Therefore any occurrence of event4 must follow a 3, which in turn must have been preceded by a 6.
- Thus whenever event4 happens in any allowed sequence, event6 has occurred (earlier in that sequence). So C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reason: Starting from event7, you can pick event3, and from event3 pick event7 again. Repeating 7 → 3 → 7 ... never forces event6 (you can always choose 3 from 7 and 7 from 3), so event6 need not happen. Therefore C1 is not disproved, so C2 (the negation of C1) is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reason: From the rules we can avoid event6. For example choose the sequence 7 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ... . All chosen successor options avoid events 5 and 6, so event6 need not occur. Thus C1 (""event6 does not happen"") can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
Step 1 — identify C2:
- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ""Event6 does happen.""

So C2 is the claim that event6 must occur.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules and look for a run that avoids event6:
- From 7: possible next {2,3,5}. Avoid 5 (since 5 -> 6).
- From 3: possible next {1,2,4,5,6,7}. Avoid 5 and 6 → can choose 1,2,4,7.
- From 1: possible next {3,4,5,7}. Avoid 5 → can choose 3,4,7.
- From 4: possible next {5,7}. Avoid 5 → choose 7.
- From 2: possible next {1,3,4} — all avoid 5 and 6.

Example cycle that never produces event6:
7 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 7 → ... 
This cycle stays within {1,2,3,4,7} and never takes any transition to 5 or 6, so event6 can be avoided indefinitely.

Step 3 — conclusion:
Because there exists a valid infinite run that never produces event6, event6 is not forced to happen. Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

True

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context: initial sequence 3 -> 7 (forced). From 7 we may choose 5. From 5 we may choose 2. So a valid prefix is 3,7,5,2 (so event2 does occur).
- From event2, an allowed immediate successor is event3. If we choose 3, then 3 forces 7, and from 7 we can choose 3 again, producing the infinite loop 3,7,3,7,... which never contains event5 after that occurrence of event2.
- Thus there exists a valid execution where event2 occurs but event5 does not occur afterward, so the implication ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context we have these transition options (condensed):
  - 4 -> {2, 6, 7}
  - 6 -> {3, 5, 7}
  - 3 -> {1, 2}
  - 1 -> {3, 7}
  - 7 -> {2, 3, 5, 6}
  - 5 -> {2, 7}
  - 2 -> {3, 4, 7}

- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") means: in every possible future starting from the initial event4, event2 will eventually occur. To refute C1 it suffices to exhibit one allowed infinite path that never visits event2.

- There is such a path: 4 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... . From 4 choose 6; from 6 choose 3; from 3 choose 1; from 1 choose 3; repeat. All those transitions are permitted and this loop never includes event2. Hence event2 is not inevitable, so C1 is false.

- C2 asserts both ""Event1 happens"" and ""C1 holds."" Even though event1 can happen on some paths, C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the context the transition rules include 4 -> {2,6,7}, 6 -> {3,5,7}, 3 -> {1,2}, and 1 -> {3,7}.
- Starting at the initial event4, choose the sequence 4 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... . At each 3 choose 1, and at each 1 choose 3. This produces an infinite loop between 1 and 3 and never includes event2.
- Therefore event2 is not guaranteed to occur (C1 is false). C2 requires C1 to hold, so C2 is also false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start: event4 happened.
- From event4 we can go to event6 (allowed).
- From event6 we can go to event3 (allowed).
- From event3 we can go to event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we can go back to event3 (allowed).

Thus there is a valid infinite path 4 → 6 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... that never includes event2. That shows C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false. C2 requires C1 to hold (and event1 happens). Even though event1 can occur on the path above, the conjunction fails because C1 is false. Therefore C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Initially, event4 happened.
2. The rule ""After event4, event3 must happen"" forces the next state to have event3.
3. C1 requires both event5 and event4 to hold in the same state.
4. The next state (forced by step 2) has event3, not event4 or event5, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.

False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- We start in the initial state where event4 happened.
- The rules say: after event4, event3 must happen. So the immediate next state must be one where event3 happens.
- C1 requires both event5 and event4 to happen in the same state.
- The immediate next state is event3 (not event4 or event5), so C1 does not hold in that next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event5 happens and event4 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen. So in the next state (immediately after the initial state) event3 occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in that next state:
- In that next state we have event3, not event4 or event5. C1 requires both event5 and event4 to hold in that same (next) state, which does not occur.
- (Even though event5 might occur later after event3, that would be a later state, not the immediate next state.)

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — what the context gives about the next state:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, the next state must be one of: event3, event4, or event5.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is false: event1 is not among the possible immediate successors of event2 (only 3, 4, or 5).
- Therefore C2 reduces to ""Event3 happens."" But event3 is only one of several possible successors (event4 or event5 could happen instead), so event3 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true given the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate next event is event1).
- C2: ""Event3 happens OR C1 holds"" (i.e., the immediate next event is event3, or event1 is the immediate next event).

Step 2 — what the context gives
- Initially event2 occurred.
- From event2 the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false: event1 is not among {event3, event4, event5}, so event1 cannot be the next event.
- C2 would be true only if the next event is event3 (since C1 is false). But from event2 the next event could be event4 or event5 as well, so event3 is not guaranteed.

Because there is a valid next-state choice (e.g., event4) where neither event3 nor event1 occurs, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule for event2: ""After event2, either event3, event4, or event5 must happen.""

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- The next event after event2 must be one of {event3, event4, event5}. Event1 is not among them, so C1 is false (event1 does not necessarily happen next).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""event3 happens or C1 holds."" C1 is false, so C2 would require event3 to necessarily happen next. But from the rule the next event could be event3, event4, or event5 — event3 is possible but not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is not entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Initial state: event7 happened.

Rule: After event7, event4 must happen. Therefore in the next state event4 occurs.

C1 claims: ""Event7 happens in the next state."" That contradicts the rule-derived fact that event4 must occur next, so C1 is false.

C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1: ""Event7 happens in the next state."" From the context, initially event7 happened, and ""after event7, event4 must happen."" So the next state is event4, not event7. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means that in the next state (which is event4) it must be true that event7 happens in the following state. But after event4 the next event must be either event1, event2, or event6 — none of which is event7. Thus C1 is not true in the next state, so C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 occurs in state s0.
- The rules say ""after event7, event4 must happen"", so in the next state s1 event4 occurs. Therefore C1 (""event7 happens in the next state"" i.e. event7 in s1) is false.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. in s1 it should be true that event7 occurs in s2. But after event4 the next state must be one of {event1, event2, event6}, so event7 cannot occur in s2. Hence C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Interpretation: C1 is the proposition ""event2 happens or event6 happens."" C2 = ""C1 always holds"" means at every step in the possible event sequence, C1 is true.

Counterexample from the rules:
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 is true at the start.
- The rules say: after event2, either event3 or event5 must happen. Choose event3 (allowed).
- When event3 happens, neither event2 nor event6 happens at that step, so C1 is false at that time.

Since there is a valid reachable step (event3 after event2) where C1 fails, C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts that the current event is either event2 or event6.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds at every time (an invariant).
- Initially event2 occurs, so C1 holds at the start.
- But the rules state: after event2, either event3 or event5 must happen. Both event3 and event5 are not event2 or event6, so at the very next step C1 would be false.
- Therefore C1 does not always hold, and C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event2 happens or event6 happens."" Right now C1 is true because initially event2 happened.
- C2 says this (C1) always holds. That would require every event in every reachable point to be either event2 or event6.
- But from the given rules, after event2 either event3 or event5 must happen. So a valid next event is event3, which is neither event2 nor event6.
- Therefore C1 can be false at the next step, so C2 (that C1 always holds) is false."

Votes: {'True': 2, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: event5 does not happen (i.e. event5 never occurs in the run).
- C2: C1 holds AND event4 happens at some point.
We must decide whether C2 can be satisfied given the rules and that event6 occurs initially.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (condensed)
- From 6 → {1, 2, 4, 7}
- From 4 → {2, 3, 5}
- From 2 → {1, 4}
- From 1 → {4, 7}
- From 7 → {1, 6}
- From 3 → {1, 2, 5, 7}
- From 5 → {1, 3, 6}

Step 3 — construct a run that satisfies C2
Start at the initial event6. Choose transitions to avoid event5 while ensuring event4 occurs:
- 6 → 4 (allowed)
- 4 → 2 (choose 2 to avoid 5)
- 2 → 4 (choose 4)
Now we can repeat 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 ... forever. This run contains event4 and never takes the option 5 at the 4-step, so event5 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
Nothing in the rules forces that event5 must eventually occur; nondeterministic choices allow avoiding event5 indefinitely while still having event4. Therefore C2 can be satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event6 happens.
- From event6 we can choose event4 (rule: after 6 → {1,2,4,7}).
- After event4 we can choose event2 (rule: after 4 → {2,3,5}), avoiding event5.
- After event2 we can choose event4 (rule: after 2 → {1,4}), returning to event4.
- Repeating the cycle 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 … keeps event4 occurring while never choosing event5.

Thus there exists a valid sequence starting from event6 in which event4 happens and event5 never happens, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: event5 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds and event4 happens (i.e., event4 happens and event5 never happens).
We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given context (i.e., follows from the rules).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initial event: event6 happened.
- From event6 one may go to event1, event2, event4, or event7 (choice is nondeterministic).
- From event4 one may go to event2, event3, or event5.
- From event5 one may go to event1, event3, or event6.
- (Other transitions exist but these are enough for the argument.)

Step 3 — counterexample showing C2 is not guaranteed
- Starting at event6, choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4, choose event5 (allowed).
This sequence makes event4 happen but also makes event5 happen, so C1 (event5 does not happen) is violated. Therefore C2 (both event4 happens and event5 does not happen) is not necessarily true.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to evaluate C2: ""C1 always holds"", where C1 = ""Event4 happens in the next state.""

1. Start: initially event1 happened.
2. From the rules: after event1 the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event5, event6}. Event4 is not among these.
3. Therefore C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is already false in the initial state (the next state could be event2, event3, event5, or event6).
4. Since C1 does not hold in the initial state, it cannot be true that C1 always holds.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e. immediately after the current state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. in every possible next-state situation C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the rules and the initial state
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event5, event6} (explicit rule).

Step 3 — check C1 from the initial state
- None of the allowed immediate successors of event1 is event4. So it is possible that the next state is event2 (or event3, event5, event6), and thus event4 does not occur in the next state.

Conclusion
- C1 is not guaranteed to hold from the initial state, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible next state, event4 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules relevant to the ""next state"" after the initial event
- Initially event1 happened.
- Transition after event1: the next event can be one of {event2, event3, event5, event6}.

Step 3 — find a counterexample
- From event1, event5 is a permitted next event. If the next state is event5, then event4 does not happen in that next state.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to hold after event1, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event6 happened.
- From event6, one allowed next event is event2 (rule: after event6 → event2 or event4).
- From event2, one allowed next event is event4 (rule: after event2 → event3, event4, or event5). Choose event4 to avoid event3/event5.
- From event4, one allowed next event is event2 (rule: after event4 → event1, event2, event3, event5, or event6). Choose event2 again.
- This yields the infinite loop 6 → 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ... which is consistent with all given rules and never produces event3, event5, or event7.

Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the premises that avoids event3 and event5 (so C1 is false) and never produces event7, C2 (""C1 holds and event7 happens"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
You ask whether C2 (""(event5 or event3) holds and event7 happens"") follows from the given facts and rules.

Start: event6 happened.

Show a valid sequence that avoids both C1 and event7. From event6 the rules allow event4 or event2 next. Choose event4, and from event4 choose event6 again (both choices are allowed by the rules). So we can repeat the cycle:

event6 -> event4 -> event6 -> event4 -> ...

This infinite (or arbitrarily long) valid sequence contains no event3, no event5, and no event7. Thus C1 (event5 or event3) need not hold, and hence C2 (C1 and event7) need not hold.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- We start with event6.
- From event6 the rules allow event2 or event4 next. From those, it is possible to choose transitions that never produce event3, event5, or event7. For example:
  6 -> 2 (allowed)
  2 -> 4 (allowed)
  4 -> 1 (allowed)
  1 -> 6 (allowed)
  and repeat: 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> ...
- This infinite/cyclic path is consistent with all ""after ..."" rules but never includes event3, event5, or event7.
- C1 (event5 or event3 happens) therefore does not necessarily hold (it can be false in a valid sequence). Since C2 requires C1 and event7, C2 is not guaranteed and so is False."

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether both (a) event7 must happen and (b) C1 (""if event1 happens then event3 happens"") must hold, given the rules and initial event4.

Reasoning:
- From event4 we can go to event6. From event6 we can go to event5. From event5 we can go back to event4. So one possible infinite execution is 4 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 6 → 5 → ... This execution never visits event7. Therefore ""event7 happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules.
- From event4 we can go to event2, then to event1 (4 → 2 → 1). From event1 we may choose to go back to event2 (1 → 2) and repeat 1 → 2 → 1 → ... forever without ever taking the 1 → 3 option. Thus it is possible for event1 to occur while event3 never occurs afterwards, so the implication ""if event1 happens then event3 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed.

Since neither component of C2 is entailed by the rules, C2 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (counterexample trace):
- Initially event4 happens.
- Choose 4 -> 2 (allowed).
- Choose 2 -> 1 (allowed).
- Choose 1 -> 2 (allowed).
Repeat the 1 <-> 2 loop forever.

This trace obeys all given ""after"" rules, contains event1, and never contains event3. Therefore C1 (""if event1 happens, then event3 happens"") is not guaranteed, so C2 (event7 happens and C1 holds) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False. Step-by-step:

- Initially event6 happened.
- The rule after event6: either event2, event4, or event5 must happen in the next state.
- C1 asserts event2 happens in the next state. The rules allow event2, but they also allow event4 or event5 instead. So event2 is possible but not forced.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state). That is also not guaranteed, because event2 could occur.

Since neither ""event2 definitely happens next"" nor ""event2 definitely does not happen next"" can be concluded, C2 is not entailed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""event2 happens in the next state."" C2 asserts the negation of C1.
- Initially event6 happened. The rule ""After event6, either event2, event4, or event5 must happen"" means the next state is one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- Event2 is therefore possible but not guaranteed. C1 is not entailed, and likewise C2 (that event2 does not happen) is also not entailed.
- Since C2 does not follow from the given information, it is not True.
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event6 happened, and the rules say that after event6 either event2, event4, or event5 must happen. Event2 is one of the allowed next events, so ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (C1) is possible but not guaranteed. Therefore its negation (C2: ""Event2 does not happen in the next state"") cannot be concluded as true."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- We start at event3.
- From event3 the allowed next events are {4,5,7} (so 4 is possible but not forced).
- From event7 the allowed next events include 6 (7 -> 6 is allowed).
- From event6 the allowed next events include 3 (6 -> 3 is allowed).
- Therefore there is a valid infinite cycle 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> ... that never visits event4 and never visits event2.
- Because such a run exists, it is not guaranteed that event4 ""eventually happens"", nor that event2 occurs. Thus C1 is not entailed and C2 (""event2 happens and C1 holds"") is not entailed.

So C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 = ""Event2 happens and Event4 eventually happens.""
- Initially event3 occurs. From event3 the next event must be one of {4,5,7}.
- Consider the allowed choices 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> ... This is a valid infinite sequence because:
  - After 3 you may choose 4.
  - After 4 you may choose 5.
  - After 5 you may choose 4.
  - Repeating 4 and 5 respects the given rules and never forces a transition to event2.
- In this sequence Event4 does occur (so C1 holds) but Event2 never occurs, so the conjunction in C2 is false on this valid run.

Because there is a valid run where C2 fails, C2 is not guaranteed and thus is False.
---
We start from the given initial event3. From the rules:

- After event3, one of {4, 5, 7} must happen.
- After event7, one of {1,2,3,4,5,6} must happen.
- After event6, one of {1,3,7} must happen.
- After event1, one of {2,3,4,6} must happen.
- (Other rules are consistent but not needed for the counterexample below.)

To show C2 (”Event2 happens and Event4 eventually happens”) is true we would need every possible allowed sequence starting from the initial event3 to include both an occurrence of event2 and an occurrence of event4. It is enough to exhibit one valid sequence that avoids either event2 or event4 to refute C2.

Construct the following infinite valid sequence that never contains event2 or event4:
3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> ...
Check each step against the rules:
- From 3 we may choose 7 (allowed).
- From 7 we may choose 6 (allowed).
- From 6 we may choose 3 (allowed).
This cycle can repeat forever and contains only events 3, 7, and 6, so neither event2 nor event4 ever occurs along this valid execution.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Final answer: False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

We are asked whether C2 (""event5 eventually happens OR event6 happens"") is guaranteed by the given transition rules starting from the initial event2.

Key transitions (condensed):
- 2 -> {1, 3, 5}
- 1 -> {2, 4, 6, 7}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- 4 -> {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- 5 -> {1, 2, 3, 6}
- 6 -> {1, 2, 3, 4}
- 7 -> {2, 5}

We need to see if every possible execution from initial 2 must eventually hit event5 or event6. It suffices to find one allowed infinite execution that avoids both 5 and 6 to show C2 is not guaranteed.

From 2 we may choose 1 (allowed). From 1 we may choose 2 (allowed). Repeating this yields the infinite trace 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... which never visits event5 or event6. Thus event5 does not eventually happen on that trace, and event6 never happens either.

Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, event6 is not guaranteed, and so C2 (""C1 holds or event6 happens"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
We ask whether, given the rules, ""C2: (event5 eventually happens) or (event6 happens)"" must hold.

From the context the possible successors (unique list) are:
- after 2: {1,3,5}
- after 1: {2,4,6,7}
- after 3: {1,2,4,5,6}
- after 4: {1,2,3,5,6}
- after 5: {1,2,3,6}
- after 6: {1,2,3,4}
- after 7: {2,5}

We can avoid both event5 and event6 by choosing transitions that stay in {1,2,3,4,7}. For example, start at 2 (given), then choose 1 (allowed), then choose 2 from 1 (allowed), then 1 again, etc.: 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... This infinite execution never produces event5 or event6. Thus C1 (event5 eventually happens) can be false, and event6 can also be false, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Interpret C1 as: whenever event4 occurs, event2 must occur afterward (in all possible continuations).
- From the context the transition graph is:
  1 -> {3,4,5}
  2 -> {1,3,5,7}
  3 -> {4,6,7}
  4 -> {3,5}
  5 -> {6,7}
  6 -> {1,2,4,7} (initial event is 6)
  7 -> {1,2,3,5}
- From event4 you can go to event3, and from event3 back to event4. So starting at 6 you can choose 6 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> ... indefinitely and never visit event2.
- That provides a counterexample to C1, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts (C1 holds) and event1 happens. Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false regardless.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Start with event6 (given). From event6 one allowed next event is event4.
- From event4 one allowed next event is event3.
- From event3 one allowed next event is event4.
- So the sequence 6,4,3,4,3,... is allowed by the rules.
- In that allowed trace event4 occurs but event2 never occurs (so C1 fails), and event1 never occurs (so the second part of C2 fails).
Therefore C2 is not entailed by the context.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Translate the rules to successors:
- 1 -> {3,4,5}
- 2 -> {1,3,5,7}
- 3 -> {4,6,7}
- 4 -> {3,5}
- 5 -> {6,7}
- 6 -> {1,2,4,7} (initial state is 6)
- 7 -> {1,2,3,5}

2. C1 says: ""If event4 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this as a necessary consequence of the rules (i.e., whenever 4 occurs, 2 must occur later), we search for a counterexample path starting from the initial state that includes 4 but never includes 2.

3. Construct a valid path that avoids event2:
- From initial 6 choose 4 (allowed: 6 -> 4).
- Then loop 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> ... forever (both 4 -> 3 and 3 -> 4 are allowed).
This infinite valid trace contains event4 but never contains event2. Thus C1 is not guaranteed by the rules.

4. C2 asserts ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (and event1 is not guaranteed either).

Therefore the hypothesis C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 says: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" That claims event5 must follow whenever event2 occurs.
- But the context states: ""After event2, either event1, event3, event5, or event7 must happen."" So after event2, event5 is only one of several possible next events (event1, event3, event5, or event7).
- Example counterexample: event1 → event2 → event1. Here event2 occurs but is followed by event1, not event5. Thus C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" C2 says C1 does not hold.
- From the context we have the explicit rule: after event2, either event1, event3, event5, or event7 must happen. That means event5 is one possible successor of event2, but not the only one.
- A counterexample sequence exists: start at event1 (given), then take the allowed transition event1 -> event2, then from event2 take the allowed transition event2 -> event1. This sequence has event2 occur but is followed by event1, not event5.
- Because there is a permitted occurrence of event2 that is not followed by event5, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens.""

Step-by-step reasoning

- The rules give allowed immediate successors (I'll list relevant edges):
  - 1 -> {2,3,5,6,7}
  - 2 -> {1,3,5,7}
  - 3 -> {2,4}
  - 4 -> {1,3,5,6}
  - 5 -> {6}
  - 6 -> {1,2,4}
  - 7 -> {1,2,4,6}
- The sequence starts with event1, so event2 can occur (1 -> 2 is allowed).
- To show C1 fails, it is enough to exhibit a legal sequence where event2 occurs but event5 never occurs afterwards. From the graph we have a cycle that avoids 5:
  - 2 -> 1 (allowed), 1 -> 6 (allowed), 6 -> 2 (allowed). Repeat this cycle indefinitely.
- Thus there is a valid execution in which event2 occurs but event5 never occurs. Hence the implication ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We must decide whether ""C1: Event7 eventually happens"" holds in the next state (C2). Interpret ""eventually happens"" as requiring that from the current state, every possible future path will eventually hit event7 (i.e. inevitability). Under that interpretation:

1. Initially event2 happens. So the next state after the initial one must be either event3 or event5 (from ""After event2, either event3 or event5 must happen"").

2. From event3 you may go to event5, event6, or event7. From event5 you may go to event1, event3, event4, or event7.

3. There is a possible infinite run avoiding event7: choose event3 -> event5 -> event3 -> event5 -> ... forever (3 → 5 → 3 → 5 ...). Both transitions 3→5 and 5→3 are allowed, so this loop never reaches event7.

4. Because such a path from the next state avoids event7 forever, ""event7 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initial event is event2. After event2, the next state is either event3 or event5.
- From event3 the possible next events are {event5, event6, event7}. From event5 the possible next events are {event1, event3, event4, event7}.
- There is a cycle that avoids event7: for example 3 -> 5 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... (3 can go to 5, and 5 can go back to 3), so it is possible to keep repeating 3 and 5 forever without ever taking the branch to event7.
- Therefore event7 is not guaranteed to eventually happen from the next state (there exists a continuation that indefinitely avoids event7).
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event: event2.
- From event2 the next event can be either event3 or event5.
- To show C2 is false we need only one reachable next-state from which event7 is not guaranteed to eventually occur.
- Take the next-state choice event3. From 3 we can go to 6 (3 -> 6), and from 6 we can go back to 3 (6 -> 3). Repeating 3 -> 6 -> 3 -> 6 ... yields an infinite execution that never visits event7.
- Thus, in the next state (when that next state is event3) event7 does not necessarily eventually happen, so C1 does not hold in the next state in general.

Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event1 one allowed next event is event4.
- After event4 one allowed next event is event7.
- So there is a valid sequence 1 → 4 → 7 in which event7 does happen, contradicting C1 (Event7 does not happen).
- Since C2 requires C1, C2 cannot be guaranteed (and in the counterexample event3 need not occur either). Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C2 says: ""Event3 happens and Event7 never happens.""
- From the rules we only know what must follow each event; they are nondeterministic choices (one of the listed successors must occur), not inevitabilities that every listed event must occur.
- Starting from the initial event1, we can choose successors so that event3 never occurs while still satisfying all rules. For example:
  - 1 (initial) -> 5 (allowed after 1)
  - 5 -> 1 (after 5 must be 1)
  - Repeat 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ...
  This infinite trace satisfies all given rules, never contains event3, and never contains event7.
- Because there exists a valid model (trace) satisfying the premises in which C2 is false, C2 is not logically entailed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and Event7 does not happen.""

Step 2 — Understand the rules
- Initially event1 happens.
- From 1 → {4,5,6}
- From 4 → {2,3,5,6,7}
- From 3 → {2,4,5}
- From 2 → {1,4,5,7}
- From 5 → {1}
- From 6 → {1,2,4}
- From 7 → {1,4,5}

(Repeated lines in the context are just duplicates of these rules.)

Step 3 — Reasoning about necessity
- Event3 can occur: take 1 → 4 → 3, since 1 allows 4 and 4 allows 3.
- Event7 is never forced: whenever a step offers 7 as an option (from 4 or 2), you can choose a different allowed successor (e.g., choose 3,2,4,5,1, etc.). There is no rule that obliges eventually choosing 7.

Conclusion
- C2 is consistent/possible with the rules (there are runs where event3 happens and event7 never happens), but it is not entailed (not required) by the context.
- The question asks whether C2 is true (i.e., must hold). It does not necessarily hold.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true. C1 is ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step event7 occurs). So C2 says: in the state immediately after the initial event4, it is true that event7 always happens.

Start: initially event4 happened. From event4 the next event can be one of {1, 3, 5}.

To show C2 is false it is enough to exhibit a possible successor state and a possible future (consistent with the rules) from that successor that never contains event7. For example:

- Choose the next event = event1 (allowed from event4).
- From event1 one allowed next is event3.
- From event3 one allowed next is event1.
- So we can loop: 4 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... forever.

This infinite trace follows the given transition rules and never contains event7. Hence in the next state (e.g., after choosing event1) it is not true that ""event7 always happens."" Therefore C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C1: ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., on every possible future path at some point event7 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., from the immediate successor state of the initial state, C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine transitions (summarized)
- 4 -> {1,3,5}
- 5 -> {3,4}
- 3 -> {1,2,5}
- 1 -> {2,3,5,7}
- 2 -> {1,3,5,7}
- 7 -> {2,4,5}
- 6 -> {1,2,3,4,7}
Initial event: 4.

Step 3 — find a counterexample showing event7 is not guaranteed
From initial 4 we can go 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... forever. All those transitions are allowed (4->1, 1->3, 3->1) and this loop never reaches event7. Thus there exists a valid infinite trace from the initial state that never contains event7.

Conclusion
- C1 is false (event7 does not always happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., in every future state/event occurrence, event7 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., after one transition from the initial state, C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules and initial state
- Initially event4 occurs.
- From event4 the next event can be 1, 3, or 5.

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C1 (and thus to C2)
- From event4 pick the successor event1 (allowed).
- From event1 one allowed successor is event2; from event2 one allowed successor is event1. Thus the cycle 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 … is possible and never involves event7.
- Therefore event7 does not ""always happen"" (C1 is false).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. But we have a next state (event1) where C1 is false (because the 1↔2 cycle avoids event7).
- Hence C2 is also false.

- That infinite sequence contains no event2 and no event6, so C1 is false on that run and event6 does not happen.
- Therefore there exists a valid execution where neither event6 happens nor C1 holds, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start at event3. From event3 you may go to event5.
- From event5 the only possible next event is event3.
- So you can loop forever: 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ...
- That infinite trace contains no event6 and never contains event2, so along that trace neither ""event6 happens"" nor ""event2 always happens"" holds.
- Because there exists a valid trace where the disjunction (event6 happens OR event2 always happens) is false, C2 is not guaranteed.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 states: ""Event2 happens or event6 happens.""
- C2 states: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., on every possible execution (from the initial event1) at some point event2 or event6 must occur / in every future from any state one of them will occur.

We can exhibit a valid infinite execution that never contains event2 or event6, which refutes C2. From the given rules:
- After event1 we may choose event4 (allowed).
- After event4 we may choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3 we may choose event1 (allowed).

So the cycle 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → ... is permitted and never includes event2 or event6. Therefore it is not true that ""event2 or event6"" must always happen on every execution. Hence C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reason: start at event1 (given). Take the choices 1 → 4 (allowed), 4 → 3 (allowed), 3 → 1 (allowed), and repeat. This yields the infinite sequence 1,4,3,1,4,3,... which never visits event2 or event6. Hence it's possible for ""Event2 happens or event6 happens"" to be false, so C1 does not always hold.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 states: ""Event2 happens or event6 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., at every step in the execution).
- Initially event1 happens. At that time neither event2 nor event6 happens, so C1 is already false at the initial step. Therefore C2 cannot be true.
- Even ignoring the initial step, there is a clear counterexample path with no event2 or event6 ever: choose transitions 1 → 4 → 3 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 5 → ... (from 4 you can go to 3, from 3 to 5, from 5 to 4, forming a loop of {3,4,5}). None of these events are 2 or 6, so C1 fails repeatedly along this infinite trace.

Thus C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event3, event4, event5, event6, or event7 must happen"" governs the next state.
- C1 is the statement ""event4 happens or event7 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., the immediate successor of the initial state).
- From the rule after event1, the next event could be event3, event5, or event6 — none of which make C1 true. Since those outcomes are allowed, C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event3, event4, event5, event6, or event7 must happen"" gives the possible next events.
- C1 is ""event4 happens or event7 happens."" While event4 or event7 are allowed next events, event3, event5, or event6 are also allowed.
- Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state (e.g., if the next event is event3, C1 is false).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the claim:
- C1 = ""event4 happens or event7 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., after the current/initial event).

Step 2 — from the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the possible next events are {event3, event4, event5, event6, event7}.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state:
- C1 would require the next event to be event4 or event7.
- But after event1 the next event could be event3, event5, or event6 as well, so C1 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event6 happens) OR (event3 happens).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the initial state).

Step 2 — examine the initial state and possible next events:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event6, event7}.

Step 3 — check whether C1 necessarily holds in the next state:
- C1 would hold if the next event is event3 or event6.
- But from event4 the next event could also be event1 or event7, which would make C1 false in that next state.
- Nothing in the given conditions rules out event1 or event7 as the next event.

Conclusion:
- C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1 = ""Event6 happens or event3 happens"" (i.e., next event is 6 or 3).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — does C1 necessarily hold immediately after the initial state?

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule “After event4, either event1, event3, event6, or event7 must happen.” So the next event can be 1, 3, 6, or 7.

Step 3 — check C1 in the next state
- C1 would be true in the next state if the next event is 3 or 6.
- But the next event could also be 1 or 7. For example, choosing next = event1 is allowed by the rules, and that makes C1 false in that next state.

Conclusion
- C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what is asked
- C1: ""Event6 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
We must decide whether C2 is necessarily true given the rules and the initial event.

Step 2 — initial condition and possible next events
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule after event4: the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event6, event7}.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state
- C1 requires the next event be event3 or event6.
- From the set of allowed next events {event1, event3, event6, event7}, event3 and event6 are possible, but event1 and event7 are also possible.
- Since event1 or event7 could occur, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in every possible next state.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 says ""Event6 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event6 happens and Event7 happens."" So C2 effectively asserts both Event6 and Event7 occur.
- The context states Event6 happens initially, so Event6 does occur. But we must check whether Event7 necessarily occurs.
- From Event6 the allowed next events are Event2 or Event4. While 6->2->7 would produce Event7, that choice is not forced.
- There is a valid sequence that avoids Event7 entirely, for example:
  6 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... (this cycle never picks 7)
- Because a path exists in which Event7 never occurs, C1 (and thus C2) is not guaranteed by the context.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""Event6 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context. C1 is ""Event6 happens and Event7 happens"", so C2 is equivalent to ""Event6 happens and Event7 happens"".

Step-by-step reasoning
- The context explicitly states that event6 happened initially, so ""Event6 happens"" is true.
- To make C2 true we also need Event7 to have happened.
- From the transition rules: after event6, either event2 or event4 must happen next (nondeterministically). From event2 it is possible to go to event7, but it's also possible to go to event1, event5, or event6. From event4 you can go to event2 or event3, and those can continue without ever requiring event7.
- Thus there exist valid event sequences starting from the initial event6 that never produce event7 (for example: 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> ...), so Event7 is not guaranteed by the rules — only possible in some branches.
- Because Event7 is not entailed by the context, C1 is not entailed, and therefore C2 (which requires C1) is not entailed.

Final answer:
False
---
Plan: restate hypothesis, inspect transitions, find a sequence that makes C1 true, then check C2.

1) Hypothesis:
- C1: Event6 happens and event7 happens.
- C2: Event6 happens and C1 holds (i.e., Event6 happens and (Event6 and Event7 happen)).

2) From the context:
- Initially event6 happened.
- From event6 the next event must be event2 or event4.
- From event2 the next event may be event1, event5, event6, or event7.
So starting at the initial event6, we can follow event6 -> event2 -> event7. That sequence shows both event6 (initial) and event7 (later) happen, so C1 is satisfiable and therefore true.

3) C2 requires event6 and C1. Since C1 is true and event6 does happen (initially), C2 is also true.

Reasoning summary:
- From the context the system starts at event7 and the transition relation is:
  - 7 → {1,3,6}
  - 3 → {1,4,7}
  - 1 → {3,5,7}
  - 4 → {3,5,7}
  - 5 → {2,6}
  - 2 → {5,7}
  - 6 → ∅ (terminal)
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. from some point onward every step is event1). For C1 to hold at some time t, every future event after t would have to be event1.
- But there is no transition 1 → 1, so once event1 occurs the next event cannot be event1. Therefore there is no point after which every future event is event1; C1 cannot become true at any time.
- Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" means there is a point (or from the start) onward every event is event1 (i.e. G event1).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" is asking if there is some future point after which event1 holds at every step (i.e. F G event1).

Look at the transition rules:
- From event1 the next event must be one of {3,5,7}. Event1 cannot follow itself (no 1→1).
- There is no state that forces event1 forever (no self-loop on 1, and no other state has only 1 as successor).
- Also there are terminal runs (e.g. hitting event6) that prevent ""event1 always"" thereafter.

Therefore there is no suffix of any run in which every subsequent event is event1. So C1 can never become permanently true, and C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Interpret C1 as ""event1 holds at every future step"" (the usual reading of ""always happens"", i.e. G(event1)). C2 says that eventually this property will hold from some point onward (F G(event1)).
- The transition graph (from the context) is:
  1 -> {3,5,7}
  2 -> {5,7}
  3 -> {1,4,7}
  4 -> {3,5,7}
  5 -> {2,6}
  6 -> {}
  7 -> {1,3,6}
  initial state: 7
- For G(event1) to ever become true from some point onward, there would have to be a state after which every step is event1. That requires a transition from event1 to event1 (a self-loop) or a cycle consisting only of event1. But event1's outgoing transitions are to 3,5,7 — none is 1, so you can never have event1 at every subsequent step.
- Also, from the start 7 you can go 7 -> 6, and 6 is terminal (no further events). In that run, event1 never occurs, and there is no later point from which event1 holds always.
- Therefore there is no run and no reachable point after which event1 holds at every future step. So C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is false."

We start at event1. From the context the transitions are:

- 1 -> {4, 5}
- 4 -> {2, 5, 7}
- 2 -> {5}
- 5 -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 7}
- 6 -> {1, 2, 3, 7}
- 7 -> {4, 5, 6}

C1 says “event7 happens in the next state.” C2 says “C1 eventually holds” (i.e., at some future step, event7 occurs).

We can avoid ever reaching event7 by the infinite loop 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... (5 may choose 1; 1 may choose 5). This path never produces event7, so there exists a valid execution in which C1 never becomes true. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

False

Reasoning:
- Initial state: event1 happened.
- The rules include ""After event1, either event2, event4, event6, or event7 must happen.""
- That means event4 is a possible next event.
- C1 asserts ""Event4 does not happen."" C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., event4 does not happen next).
- Because a next state exists in which event4 does happen, C2 is not guaranteed and thus is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event4 does not happen.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event2, event4, event6, or event7 must happen"" applies to the next state.

Step 3 — reason:
- From event1 the next event could be event4 (it's explicitly allowed).
- Because event4 is a possible next event, we cannot guarantee that ""event4 does not happen"" in the next state.

Conclusion:
C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" (i.e., in the current state event4 is false).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state event4 does not happen.

Step 2 — use the premises
- Initially event1 happened.
- From the rules: after event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event4, event6, event7}.

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- Because event4 is explicitly one of the allowed next events after event1, it is possible that event4 does occur in the next state.
- Therefore we cannot conclude that event4 definitely does not happen in the next state.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed by the premises, so the correct answer is: False."

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The context specifies that after event7 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event4} (this appears twice but is the same constraint).
- Event5 is not among the permitted immediate successors of event7, so ""Event5 happens in the next state"" (C1) does not hold.
- Since C1 is not true in the required next-state options, the claim that C1 always holds (C2) is false.
---
We are given transition rules and that initially event7 happened.

Hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state."" (i.e., the immediate successor state is event5)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in all possible immediate successors event5 occurs)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the context: ""After event7, either event1, event2, event3, or event4 must happen."" Those are the immediate possible next states from the initial event7.
2. The set of possible next events from event7 is {event1, event2, event3, event4}. Event5 is not included.
3. Therefore C1 (that event5 happens in the next state) is not guaranteed from the initial condition; in fact it is false for any immediate successor that is event1, event2, event3, or event4.
4. Since C1 does not hold in at least one possible next state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are given:
- Initially event7 occurred.
- After event7, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event4} (repeated in the context).

C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""  
C2: ""C1 always holds.""

From the rules, immediately after event7 the next event cannot be event5 (it must be 1,2,3, or 4). So C1 is false for the initial transition. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 is ""Event6 does not happen"", so C2 is equivalent to ""Event6 happens.""

From the rules:
- Initially event3 occurs.
- From event3 one may go to {2,4,6,7}.
- From event2 → {1,4}.
- From event1 → {5,7}.
- From event5 → {1}.

So starting at event3 we can choose transitions that avoid event6, e.g.:
3 → 2 → 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ... (looping between 1 and 5).

This infinite trace never contains event6, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold, i.e. that event6 must happen) is not true.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 asserts that event6 happens.
- Starting from the initial event3, there is a valid sequence that never includes event6: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... 
  - 3 -> 2 is allowed (after 3: {2,4,6,7}),
  - 2 -> 1 is allowed (after 2: {1,4}),
  - 1 -> 5 is allowed (after 1: {5,7}),
  - 5 -> 1 is required (after 5: 1), producing a perpetual 1–5 loop.
- This sequence satisfies all rules and never produces event6, so C1 can hold and C2 does not necessarily hold.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
We ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""event6 happens"") is guaranteed by the rules.

Start at the initial event3. From event3 one possible successor is event2. From event2 one possible successor is event1. From event1 one possible successor is event5. From event5 the only successor is event1, so 1↔5 can loop indefinitely. That entire sequence (3 → 2 → 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ...) never includes event6, and it respects all given ""after"" rules.

Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which event6 never happens, event6 is not forced to occur. Therefore C2 (""event6 happens"") is not entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4 one allowed next is event5.
- From event5 one allowed next is event1.
- From event1 one allowed next is event4.
- That yields a valid infinite loop: 4 → 5 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 1 → ... which never includes event3 or event6.
- C1 requires that event6 and event3 happen. The loop above avoids both, so C1 does not hold on that run.
- C2 asserts C1 always holds (i.e., in all possible runs). Because we found a valid run where C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 = ""Event6 happens and event3 happens.""

Start state: event4 happened. Allowed transitions (from the context):
- 4 -> {3,5,7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3}
- 2 -> {1}
- 1 -> {3,4,6}
- 3 -> {4,6,7}
- 6 -> {1,2,5,7}
- 7 -> {2,3,4,5,6}

A counterexample suffices to show C2 is false. From the initial event4, follow this allowed cycle:

4 -> 5 (4 allows 5)
5 -> 2 (5 allows 2)
2 -> 1 (2 forces 1)
1 -> 4 (1 allows 4)

This yields the infinite loop 4,5,2,1,4,... which never visits event3 or event6. Thus C1 (that event6 and event3 happen) does not hold on this possible execution, so it is not true that C1 always holds.

Final answer: False
---
False

Counterexample (one possible infinite trace avoiding both event3 and event6):
4 (initial) -> 5 (allowed after 4) -> 2 (allowed after 5) -> 1 (only option after 2) -> 4 (choose 4 after 1) -> repeat.

This cycle (4 → 5 → 2 → 1 → 4 …) never produces event3 or event6, so ""event6 happens and event3 happens"" does not always hold."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen.""
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event2 happened."" That already contradicts C1, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., event2 never happens). Because C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 cannot be true.
- (Additionally, the transition rules allow event2 to occur after other events, so there's no way to guarantee event2 never happens.)

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event2 never happens at any time).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- The very first sentence of the context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That is a direct fact that event2 occurs at the initial time.
- The rest are transition rules (which allow various events to follow others), but they cannot undo the initial fact that event2 already happened.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 asserts event2 does not happen. That contradicts the given initial fact that event2 did happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 asserts C1 always holds; since C1 is already false at the initial time, C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., Event2 never happens (in the initial state and at all future points).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- The very first sentence is ""Initially, event2 happened."" That directly contradicts C1: event2 did happen initially.
- Even ignoring the initial fact, the transition rules allow event2 to occur (e.g., after event6 one allowed next event is event2, and after event4 one allowed next event is event2).

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since event2 is stated to have happened initially, C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

We need to check whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") follows from the given rules.

Summary of rules (as a transition graph):
- 6 -> {4, 5}
- 4 -> {7}
- 5 -> {7}
- 7 -> {2, 5, 6}
- 2 -> {1, 3, 4, 5}
- 1 -> {7}
- 3 -> {1, 2}

Counterexample showing C2 fails:
- Start: 6 (given).
- Choose 6 -> 5.
- Then 5 -> 7.
- From 7 choose 7 -> 6.
This yields the cycle 6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7 -> ... which never reaches event1.

Consequences:
- Event1 is not guaranteed to happen (there is a valid infinite run that never contains event1), so the ""Event1 happens"" part of C2 is false.
- C1 (""if event5 happens then event1 happens"") is false as well, because in the cycle above event5 occurs repeatedly but event1 never occurs.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- From the context, after initial event6 either event4 or event5 must happen. The choices are nondeterministic, so multiple traces are possible.
- To show C2 is false it is enough to produce a valid trace where either event1 does not occur or C1 fails.
- Counterexample trace that avoids event1 while including event5: 6 → 5 (allowed) → 7 (must after 5) → 5 (one allowed choice after 7) → 7 → 5 → ... . This 5–7 loop is permitted by the rules and never forces event1.
- Thus event1 does not necessarily happen, and the implication ""if event5 happens then event1 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed (because we can have event5 happen repeatedly without ever reaching event1).
- Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens"") is entailed by the given rules.

Restating the rules compactly (nondeterministic transitions):
- Start: event6 happens.
- 6 -> {4 or 5}.
- 4 -> 7.
- 5 -> 7.
- 7 -> {2 or 5 or 6}.
- 2 -> {1 or 3 or 4 or 5}.
- 1 -> 7.
- 3 -> {1 or 2}.

We only need one possible execution that violates C2 to conclude C2 is not guaranteed (i.e., is False).

Counterexample execution showing C2 fails:
- Start at 6 (given).
- Choose 6 -> 4.
- 4 -> 7.
- From 7 choose 7 -> 6.
- Repeat 6 -> 4 -> 7 -> 6 -> ... indefinitely.

In this execution no event1 ever occurs, so ""Event1 happens"" is false. Thus C2 is false.

Also, to refute C1 (""if 5 then 1""), consider this execution:
- 6 -> 5.
- 5 -> 7.
- From 7 choose 7 -> 6.
- Then loop 6 -> 4 -> 7 -> 6 -> ... forever.

Here event5 occurs but event1 never does, so C1 is false as well.

Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- C1 is the statement ""event4 happens or event6 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., the immediate next event is either event4 or event6).
- But the immediate next event cannot be event4 or event6; it must be event1, event2, or event5.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen"" forces the immediate next state to be one of event1, event2, or event5.
- C1 asserts ""event4 or event6 happens."" None of event1, event2, or event5 is event4 or event6, so C1 does not hold in the next state.
- (Although from event5 a later step could lead to event4 or event6, that would be two steps away — C2 asks about the next state.)
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C2 asserts that ""C1 holds in the next state"". C1 is ""event4 or event6 happens"". So C2 claims that in the immediate next state either event4 or event6 occurs.

Step 2 — use the given transitions from the initial state:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5}.

Step 3 — check C1 in that next state:
- None of {event1, event2, event5} is event4 or event6, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 2, 'True': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initial event is 3. From the given rules the transition graph is:
  1 -> {2,7}
  2 -> {4,6}
  3 -> {1,2,4,5}
  4 -> {1,3}
  5 -> {3,6,7}
  6 -> {3}
  7 -> {1,2,3,4,6}
- C2 states ""always (eventually event1)"". For C2 to be true, every possible future (from every reachable state) must eventually produce event1.
- But there are reachable cycles that avoid event1 entirely. For example:
  3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 ...
  each step stays within {3,5,6} (3 can choose 5, 5 can choose 6, 6 must go to 3). This yields an infinite run with no event1.
  Another cycle is 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 which also avoids event1.
- Since there exist infinite executions starting at the initial 3 that never produce event1, it is not true that ""always eventually event1.""

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis: C2 asserts that ""Event1 eventually happens"" holds on all possible executions (i.e., every future).
- Start: initially event3 occurs.
- From 3 the allowed next events are {1,2,4,5}. To refute ""always eventually 1"" it suffices to exhibit a possible infinite trace that never visits 1.
- Choose 3 -> 2. From 2 the options are {4,6}. Choose 6. From 6 the only option is 3. So we have the cycle 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3.
- Repeating that cycle indefinitely (always picking 2 from 3 and 6 from 2) yields an infinite execution that never produces event1.
- Therefore event1 does not inevitably occur on all paths, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start at event3 (given).
- From event3 one allowed next is event5.
- From event5 one allowed next is event6.
- From event6 the next event must be event3.
- Thus there is a cycle 3 → 5 → 6 → 3 → … that can repeat indefinitely.
- This infinite run never visits event1, so it violates ""event1 eventually happens"" from those points.
- Therefore it is not true that ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., it is not guaranteed at every time that event1 will eventually occur)."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning summary:
- Start: event5 occurs.
- From event5 you may go to event4 (allowed).
- From event4 you may go back to event5 (allowed).
- That yields an infinite cycle 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 … that never contains event3.
- Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to happen (C1 is false), so C2 (which requires C1) is also false.
---
We are given nondeterministic “after” rules and an initial event5. C1 says “event3 always happens” (i.e., in every possible sequence starting from event5, event3 occurs). C2 adds “and event1 happens.”

Examine the rules relevant to event5 and event4:
- After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1, event5, event6, or event7 must happen.

From the initial event5 one allowed choice is event4, and from event4 one allowed choice is event5. So there is a valid infinite execution that cycles 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → ... . This execution never contains event3, so event3 does not always happen. Therefore C1 is false, and so C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

Final answer: False
---
We start at event5. From the rules:
- 5 -> {2,4}
- 4 -> {1,5,6,7}
- 1 -> {3,5,7}
- 2 -> {3,4,7}
- 3 -> {2,4,5,7}
- 6 -> {1,3,7}
- 7 -> {1,3,4,6}

To show C1 (""Event3 always happens"") fails it suffices to give one valid infinite sequence in which event3 never occurs. From the transitions above, 5 -> 4 and 4 -> 5 are both allowed, so the infinite sequence 5,4,5,4,... is legal and never contains event3. Thus C1 is false.

C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is also false.

Final answer:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We interpret C2 as the claim that from the initial event (event3), it is inevitable that at some future point either event7 or event2 will occur (i.e., on every possible execution eventually event7 or event2 holds).

Given the rules:
- Start: event3.
- After event3: event4 or event7.
- After event4: event2 or event5.
- After event5: event4 or event7.
(Other rules exist but are irrelevant to the reachable fragment we use.)

From event3 one can choose event4 (avoiding event7). From event4 one can choose event5 (avoiding event2). From event5 one can choose event4 (avoiding event7). Thus there is an infinite execution:
3 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ...
that never reaches event2 or event7. Because such a path exists, it is not inevitable that event2 or event7 will eventually occur.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C1 = ""event7 happens or event2 happens"".  
C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point either event7 or event2 occurs).

From the rules:
- Initially event3.
- After event3 → either event4 or event7.
- After event4 → either event2 or event5.
- After event5 → either event4 or event7.

Construct a counterexample infinite trace that avoids event2 and event7:
- Start: event3 → choose event4 (avoid event7).
- event4 → choose event5 (avoid event2).
- event5 → choose event4 (avoid event7).
- Repeat event4 → event5 → event4 → ... forever.

This trace never produces event2 or event7, so C1 never becomes true; therefore C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
We treat the ""After X, either Y or Z must happen"" rules as nondeterministic transitions. From the context the transitions are:

- 3 -> {4,7}
- 4 -> {2,5}
- 5 -> {4,7}
- 6 -> {1,4}
- 7 -> {4,5,6}
- 2 -> {1,3,6}
- 1 -> {3,5,6}

We start at event3. C1 is ""event7 or event2 happens"". C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. that at some future step event2 or event7 will occur).

There exists an infinite execution that never hits 2 or 7: choose 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> ... (from 3 choose 4 to avoid 7; from 4 choose 5 to avoid 2; from 5 choose 4 to avoid 7, and repeat). This loop (4↔5) avoids both event2 and event7 forever.

Because a possible execution never reaches event2 or event7, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold. Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event4 happens and Event7 always happens"") is True or False.

1) Identify hypotheses:
- C1: Event7 always happens (i.e., in every possible future sequence, event7 will occur).
- C2: Event4 happens AND C1 holds.

2) Relevant transitions (from the context):
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,7}
- 2 -> {1,4,5,7}
- 3 -> {2,4,5,7}
- 4 -> {1,3,5,6}
- 5 -> {1,3,4}
- 6 -> {1,3,4,5,7}
- 7 -> {1,2,3}

Start: event1 has happened.

3) Find a path that avoids event7 forever (if any exists, C1 is false). From 1 we can go to 4. From 4 we can go to 6. From 6 we can go back to 1. That gives a cycle 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 that never visits event7. This cycle can be repeated indefinitely, so there exists an infinite sequence with no event7.

4) Conclusion:
- C1 is false (event7 is not inevitable).
- Therefore C2 (""event4 happens and C1 holds"") is false (even though event4 can happen, C1 does not hold).

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 occurs. From event1 one allowed next event is event4.
- From event4 one allowed next event is event1.
- So there is a valid infinite sequence 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... that never includes event7.
- Therefore C1 (""Event7 always happens"") is false (there exists a run with no event7).
- C2 requires both ""Event4 happens"" and C1. Although event4 can happen, C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.
---
The hypothesis C2 asserts (a) Event4 happens and (b) C1 holds, where C1 says Event7 always happens (i.e., in every possible future/event sequence).

From the rules (condensed):
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,7}
- 2 -> {1,4,5,7}
- 3 -> {2,4,5,7}
- 4 -> {1,3,5,6}
- 5 -> {1,3,4}
- 6 -> {1,3,4,5,7}
- 7 -> {1,2,3}

Starting at 1, we can pick transitions that avoid 7 indefinitely. For example:
1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ...
Each step follows an allowed transition and never visits event7. This shows C1 is false (Event7 does not always happen).

C2 requires C1 to be true. Even though event4 can occur (as in the example), C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- Initial event4 happens.
- From event4 the rules allow either event2 or event5 to happen next.
- Choose the branch event5 (this is permitted).
- From event5 the rules allow event2, event6, or event7. Choose event6 (permitted).
- After event6, event1 must happen.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence 4 → 5 → 6 → 1 in which event1 does happen, so C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in that sequence.
- C2 requires both ""Event2 happens"" and C1 holds. Because we have a valid sequence where C1 fails, C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 occurs.
- After event4 the next event must be either event2 or event5. So event2 can occur, but it is not forced (we could pick event5 instead).
- Event1 only occurs after event6, and event6 is forced after event7 (and is also one of the options after event2/3/4/5). Thus if a sequence ever reaches event6, event1 will follow.
- There exist sequences that make C2 true: e.g. 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> ... repeatedly choosing options that avoid 6 and 7, so event2 happens and event1 never occurs.
- But there also exist valid sequences that make C2 false: e.g. 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 1, where event2 never happens and event1 does happen (or 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1, where event2 happens but event1 also happens).

Because the premises do not force ""event2 happens and event1 does not happen"" in all possible valid sequences, C2 is not entailed. Therefore the hypothesis is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""Event2 happens and Event1 does not happen"") follows from the given conditions, starting with event4.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4, either event2 or event5 must happen. We can choose event5.
- From event5, either event2, event6, or event7 must happen. Choose event6.
- From event6, event1 must happen.

This permitted sequence 4 → 5 → 6 → 1 respects all given rules but makes event1 happen (so C1 is false) and event2 does not occur in this sequence. Thus C2 (""Event2 happens and Event1 does not happen"") is not guaranteed by the premises — there is a valid scenario where C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C1: event5 happens and event7 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible future sequence both event5 and event7 occur).
- Event7 has already happened initially, so the only uncertainty is whether event5 must inevitably occur.

Step 2 — relevant transition rules (condensed)
- 7 -> {1,2,4,5,6}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,6,7}
- 2 -> {1,5,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,7}
- 4 -> {2,3,5,6}
- 5 -> {3,4,6}
- 6 -> {4,5,7}

Step 3 — produce a counterexample run that never visits event5
From the initial event7, choose transitions that avoid 5:
- 7 -> 1
- 1 -> 2
- 2 -> 1
Then repeat 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 ... indefinitely. All these transitions are allowed, and none of them include event5. Thus there exists a valid execution in which event5 never happens (even though event7 already happened).

Conclusion
Because there is a possible run that never produces event5, C1 does not hold in all runs. Therefore C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 has happened, so C1 reduces to ""event5 happens"" (event7 already true).
- From event7 one possible next event is event2. From event2 the possible next events are event1 or event7 (we can avoid event5). From event1 we can go back to event2. Thus there is a valid infinite sequence 7 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... that never includes event5.
- Because there exists a run consistent with the rules in which event5 never occurs, C1 does not hold in all runs. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 has occurred, so C1 would require that event5 also happens at some point.
- From event7 we can go to event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we can go to event2 (allowed).
- From event2 we can go back to event1 (allowed).
- Thus there is a valid infinite sequence 7 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... that never includes event5.
- Because at least one possible run starting from the initial state avoids event5, C1 (which requires event5 to happen) does not hold on all runs.

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists some future state at which C1 is true)

Step 2 — use the transition rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the next event may be one of {event1, event5, event6, event7}.
- After event1, the next event may be one of {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7}.
- In particular, after event3 we can choose event1, and after event1 we can choose event3.

Step 3 — exhibit a witness path
- Take the path: event3 (initial) -> event1 -> event3.
- At the state where event1 has just occurred, the next state is event3, so C1 is true at that state.
- Therefore C1 holds at some future state, so C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: event7 happens or event1 happens.
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens. Equivalently C2 ↔ (event1 or event7 or event2).

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4, one of {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7} must happen.
- From event3 → one of {event4, event5}.
- From event5 → one of {event4, event7}.
- From event6 → one of {event4, event5}.
- From event1 → event2 (but nothing forces event1 to occur).
- No rule forces event1 to ever occur from other events.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample trace
- Start: event4.
- Choose event3 (allowed from event4).
- From event3 choose event4 (allowed).
- Repeat: event4 → event3 → event4 → ... indefinitely.
This infinite trace never produces event1, event2, or event7 (each step chooses allowed transitions that avoid 2 and 7).

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a valid sequence starting from the initial condition that never yields event1, event2, or event7, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore the hypothesis C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
C2 is the statement (C1 holds) or event2 happens. C1 is (event7 or event1). So C2 is equivalent to (event1 or event2 or event7).

From the context: initially event4 happened, and after event4 one of {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7} must happen. If event2 or event7 occurs then C2 is true. But it is possible to choose transitions that avoid event2 and event7 forever: e.g. from 4 choose event3, then from 3 choose event4, then from 4 choose event3, etc. This cycle 4→3→4→3... never produces event1, event2, or event7. There is no rule forcing event1 to ever occur. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Answer: False
---
We want to know whether C2 = (Event7 or Event1) or Event2 must be true given the rules and initial event4.

Step-by-step:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4, one of {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7} must happen next.
- To try to falsify C2, avoid event1, event2, and event7. From event4 we can pick event3 (allowed).
- After event3, one of {event4, event5} must happen; pick event4 (allowed).
- Now we are back at event4 and can repeat the same choices (4 → 3 → 4 → 3 …) indefinitely.
- This infinite trace respects all given ""after X, one of {...} must happen"" rules and never produces event1, event2, or event7.

Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where none of event7, event1, or event2 ever occurs, C2 is not entailed.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initial event is event4. From event4 the next event may be one of {2,3,5,6,7}.
- The transitions allow 4 -> 3 and 3 -> 4 (since after 4 we can choose 3, and after 3 we can choose 4).
- Therefore there exists an infinite execution that alternates 4,3,4,3,... and never includes event2.
- Because a valid sequence avoids event2 forever, ""Event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Thus C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event4 happened.
- From event4 one allowed next is event3. From event3 one allowed next is event4.
- Therefore we can repeatedly take the cycle 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... forever.
- This infinite run never includes event2, so ""Event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules.
- Hence C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (means: at every step/event in the execution, event3 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given transition rules (starting from initial event6).

Step 2 — restate the transition graph (unique transitions)
- 1 -> {4,5}
- 2 -> {1,3,4,6}
- 3 -> {1,4,6}
- 4 -> {1}
- 5 -> {1,3,6}
- 6 -> {2,3,7}   (initial state is 6)
- 7 -> {1,4,5,6}

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false already because the initial event is 6 (not 3), so there is at least one step where event3 does not occur.
- Therefore C2 reduces to ""event4 happens"" (since C1 is false, C2 holds only if event4 occurs somewhere on every possible run).

Step 4 — show a counterexample run that avoids event4 forever
- From the initial 6 choose transitions to avoid 4:
  6 -> 3 (allowed)
  3 -> 1 (avoid 4)
  1 -> 5 (avoid 4)
  5 -> 6 (avoid 4)
- This yields the cycle 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> ... which can be repeated forever and never visits event4.
- On this infinite run event3 does not occur at every step (so C1 is false) and event4 never occurs, so C2 is false on this run.

Conclusion
- Because there exists a valid execution that makes both C1 false and never produces event4, C2 is not guaranteed. Final answer: False
---

---
False

Reasoning (concise):

- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is impossible: after event3 the rules allow only events 1, 4, or 6 next, so you cannot have event3 at every step. Thus C1 is false.

- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") would require that event4 happens in every allowed execution (to make the disjunction true when C1 is false). But there is a valid execution that never contains event4:

  Start at the given initial event6, then take the choices 6 → 3 → 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... repeatedly. All those transitions are allowed by the rules (6→3, 3→1, 1→5, 5→1), and this infinite run never visits event4.

Since there exists a permitted execution with neither C1 true nor event4 ever occurring, C2 is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event2 occurred.
2. The rule ""after event2, either event3, event4, event5, or event6 must happen"" gives the possible next events: {3,4,5,6}.
3. C1 asserts ""event6 happens in the next state"" — this is possible but not guaranteed (6 is one option among 3,4,5,6).
4. C2 asserts ""event7 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e. the next event is 7 or the next event is 6.
5. Event7 is not among the allowed immediate successors of event2, so 7 cannot be the next event.
6. Because the next event could be 3 (for example), C1 can be false and event7 is false in that branch. That provides a counterexample to C2.
Therefore C2 is not entailed by the context — False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened. From event2 the next event can be one of {3,4,5,6}.
- C1 asserts the next event is 6; that is not forced because 2 could go to 3,4, or 5 instead.
- To show C2 (event7 happens or C1) is not guaranteed, exhibit a counterexample path that avoids both:
  - From 2 take 3 (allowed).
  - From 3 take 2 (allowed).
  - Repeat the 2↔3 cycle forever. In this execution the next event was not 6 (so C1 is false) and event7 never happens.
- Therefore C2 does not follow from the given rules.
---
Step 1 — interpret the rules
- Initially event2 occurred.
- ""In the next state"" after event2, the allowed events are {event3, event4, event5, event6} (from the rule ""After event2, either event3, event4, event5, or event6 must happen"").

Step 2 — interpret the hypothesis
- C1: event6 happens in the next state (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: event7 happens OR C1 holds (so C2 is true iff either event7 happens next or event6 happens next).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- From the allowed next events after event2, event7 is not among them, so event7 cannot happen in the next state.
- Event6 is one possible next event but not guaranteed (the next event could instead be event3, event4, or event5).
- Therefore the disjunction ""event7 happens OR event6 happens next"" is not guaranteed to hold.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event4 or event5 happens."" C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" i.e. (event4 or event5) or event2.
- Initially event6 happens. From the rules: after event6 one may have event1, event2, event4, or event5. After event1 one may have event2, event6, or event7. So the choices are nondeterministic.
- Construct a valid sequence that avoids event2, event4, and event5: 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> ... . Each step respects the rules (after 6 choose 1; after 1 choose 6).
- In that sequence neither event4 nor event5 ever occurs (so C1 is false) and event2 never occurs. Hence C2 = (C1 or event2) is false in this model.
- Because a permitted sequence exists where C2 is false, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event4 happens) OR (event5 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event2 happens) = (event2 OR event4 OR event5).

We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed (must be true) given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and possible choices:
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6: one of {event1, event2, event4, event5} must happen next.
  - To try to falsify C2, avoid choosing event2, event4, and event5; so pick event1 instead.
- From event1: one of {event2, event6, event7} must happen.
  - To continue avoiding event2, pick event7 (or pick event6 and return to event1 loop).
- From event7: one of {event1, event2} must happen.
  - To avoid event2, pick event1.

This yields a valid infinite loop 6 → 1 → 7 → 1 → 7 → ... that never produces event2, event4, or event5.

Step 3 — conclusion:
Because there exists a allowed sequence (described above) starting from the given initial event that avoids event2, event4, and event5 forever, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer:
False
---
We ask whether C2 (event4 or event5, or event2) must hold in every possible run starting from the given context.

1. Initially event6 happens.
2. From the rules: after event6, one of {event1, event2, event4, event5} must happen. So it's possible to pick event1 (which does not yet satisfy C2).
3. After event1, one of {event2, event6, event7} must happen. So it's possible to pick event6.
4. Thus there is a valid infinite trace 6 → 1 → 6 → 1 → ... that never includes event2, event4, or event5.

Because a permitted trace exists that avoids event2, event4, and event5, C2 is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e. event2 must occur at some future point).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. event2 does not necessarily happen).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (condensed)
- 6 → {1,5}
- 1 → {3,4,7}
- 3 → {4,5}
- 4 → {1,2,3,5,7}
- 5 → {2,3,4,6,7}
- 7 → {2,4,5}
- 2 → {1,3,5,6}

Step 3 — find a run avoiding event2
- Start: 6.
- Choose 6 → 1.
- Then follow the cycle 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 4 → ... .
  All of those transitions are allowed, and none include event2.

This shows there is a valid infinite sequence starting from the initial event6 that never visits event2. Therefore ""Event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed, so C1 does not hold.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 choose event6 (allowed).
- This yields a cycle: 6 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 6 → ... that never includes event2.

Because there is a valid infinite trace that avoids event2, ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) does not hold in all executions. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

We ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""event2 never eventually happens"") is true.

- 5 -> {2,3,4,6,7}
- 7 -> {2,4,5}
- 2 -> {1,3,5,6}

Starting at 6, choose 1 (allowed). From 1 choose 3, then from 3 choose 4, then from 4 choose 1 — this yields the infinite cycle 6 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 4 → … which never visits event2. Since a valid infinite sequence exists that avoids event2, ""event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""event6 always happens"" (i.e., at every step from some point onward the event is 6).
- From the transition rules: after event6 the only possible next events are event1 or event3. There is no transition that allows event6 to follow event6.
- Therefore it is impossible to have event6 at two consecutive steps, so you cannot have a run where every step (or every step from some point onward) is event6. Hence C1 can never hold, and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Interpret C1 as ""event6 holds at every future step"" (a global/always property G(event6)). C2 is ""eventually C1 holds"" (F(G(event6))): there is a time from which event6 holds forever.

- From the rules: after event6 the next event must be either event1 or event3 (not event6). Thus no two consecutive occurrences of event6 are possible.

- For G(event6) to hold from some time t onward, the event at t and every subsequent event would have to be event6. That would require event6 to follow itself at t+1, which is impossible by the transition rule.

- Therefore G(event6) cannot ever become true at any time, so F(G(event6)) is false.

So C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context the transition graph is:
   - 1 -> {4,6,7}
   - 2 -> {3,4,5,7}
   - 3 -> {2,5,7}   (initial event)
   - 4 -> {1,2,3,5,6,7}
   - 5 -> {1,2,3,7}
   - 6 -> {1,3}
   - 7 -> {1,3,4,5}

2. Interpret C1 (""Event6 always happens"") in the usual temporal sense: at some time t, from that time onward every event is event6 (i.e., the system stays at 6 at every future step).

3. That requires a transition 6 -> 6 (or at least that every time the system is at 6 the next event is again 6). But the outgoing set for 6 is {1,3}, so after a 6 the next event must be 1 or 3, not 6. Therefore it is impossible for the system to ever enter a state where every subsequent event is 6.

4. Hence C1 can never hold, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: event4 eventually happens.
- Hypothesis C2: event3 happens AND C1 holds (so both event3 and event4 must occur).
- From the rules we have nondeterministic choices. Starting at event6, one possible transition is to event1, and from event1 one possible transition is back to event6.
- Thus there is a valid infinite trace 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> ... that never visits event3 or event4.
- Because such a trace exists, neither ""event4 eventually happens"" nor ""event3 happens"" is guaranteed in all executions; in particular the conjunction required by C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (concise):
- C2 asserts: event3 happens and event4 eventually happens.
- From the initial event6, choose the transitions: 6 -> 3 (so event3 happens), then 3 -> 1, 1 -> 2, and 2 -> 4 (so event4 eventually happens).
- Thus there exists a valid sequence (6,3,1,2,4,...) in which both event3 and event4 occur, so C2 can be satisfied.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""Event3 happens and Event4 eventually happens"") follows from the given rules, starting with event6.

From the rules we have these possible next-events:
- 6 -> {1,3,4,5}
- 1 -> {2,6}
- 2 -> {3,4,6}
- 3 -> {1,5,7}
- 4 -> {1,2,3,7}
- 5 -> {1,2,6,7}
- 7 -> {1,3}

To refute C2 it is enough to give a possible (legal) sequence that avoids either event3 or event4 (or both). Starting at 6, choose the following transitions repeatedly:
6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> ...
All those steps are allowed (6 can go to 1, 1 can go to 2, 2 can go to 6). This infinite sequence never visits event3 or event4. Hence neither ""event3 happens"" nor ""event4 eventually happens"" is guaranteed by the rules.

Therefore C2 is not entailed; the correct answer is:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""Event4 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens"") is true given the context.

- The context says initially event7 happened. After event7, one of event3, event4, or event6 must happen.
- Therefore event4 is allowed (e.g., the sequence event7 → event4 is permitted).
- That contradicts C1 (""Event4 does not happen""), so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold, so C2 is false regardless of whether event2 can occur.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning: Start at event7. From event7 you can go to event3 (allowed). From event3 you can go to event2 (allowed). That sequence 7 → 3 → 2 contains event2 and never contains event4, so ""event4 does not happen"" (C1) and event2 happens, hence C2 holds.
---
True

Reasoning (concise): C2 asserts both that event4 never occurs and that event2 does occur. Starting from the initial event7, the rules allow 7 -> 3 (since after 7 we may have 3,4, or 6) and then 3 -> 2 (since after 3 we may have 1,2,6, or 7). This gives the finite prefix 7, 3, 2 which contains event2 and contains no event4. None of the rules force event4 later, so a full sequence avoiding event4 and including event2 is possible. Hence C2 can be satisfied."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether, given the rules, the statement ""Event2 happens and Event3 does not happen"" (C2) is true.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens. That forces event5 to happen.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2, event4, event6, event7} must happen. This is a choice, not a necessity for event2.
- If we choose event7 after event5, event7 allows no further events. That sequence (4 → 5 → 7) contains no event2 and no event3, so C1 (event3 does not happen) holds but event2 does not happen.
- Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event2 does not occur, C2 (which requires event2 to happen) is not guaranteed by the context.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
We ask whether C2 (""Event2 happens and Event3 does not happen"") is entailed by the context.

From the context:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event5 must happen. So sequence starts: 4 → 5.
- After event5 one of {1,2,4,6,7} must happen. So event2 is a possible next event but not forced.
- If event2 happens, the next event must be one of {1,3,5,7}. It is possible to choose one that is not event3 (for example 1 or 7).
Thus the context allows a sequence that satisfies C2 (for example: 4 → 5 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 7, where event3 never occurs). However, the context does not force event2 to happen nor force event3 to be absent in every possible sequence.

Therefore C2 is not logically guaranteed by the context. Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens and Event3 does not happen"") is entailed by the rules.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Initial fact: event4 happened. By the rule ""After event4, event5 must happen"", event5 must occur next. So any valid sequence begins 4 → 5.

2. From event5 the allowed next events are {1,2,4,6,7}. The process is nondeterministic: one of those must happen, but the rules do not force which one.

3. A counterexample showing C2 is not guaranteed: choose 7 after 5. Then the sequence is 4 → 5 → 7. Rule: ""After event7, no other events can happen"", so the sequence stops. In that sequence:
   - Event2 does not happen (so ""Event2 happens"" is false).
   - Event3 also does not happen (so C1 happens to hold), but the conjunction in C2 fails because Event2 did not happen.

Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules where Event2 does not occur, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We interpret C1 as the statement ""event7 holds at every future step"" (G event7), and C2 as ""eventually C1 holds"" (F G event7).

Step-by-step reasoning from the transition rules:
- Start: event1.
- From 1 you can go to 6 or 7.
  - If you go 1 → 6 → 3 → 6 → ... you can loop forever on {6,3} and never see event7, so C1 (""event7 always happens"") is not guaranteed and is false in general.
- Could C1 ever become true from some point onward (i.e. F G event7)? To have G event7 hold from some state, every subsequent event must be 7. But 7 has no self-loop: 7 → 4, so immediately after any 7 the next event must be 4 (not 7). Therefore it is impossible for event7 to hold at every future step from any point.

Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., at all future steps event7 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the future, from then on C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Start: event1 happens.
- After event1: either event6 or event7.
- After event6: either event3, event4, or event5.
- After event3: event6.
- After event7: event4.
- After event4: event2.
- After event2: either event4, event5, event6, or event7.
- After event5: one of event1, event2, event4, event6, or event7.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample trace
- From the start pick event6 after event1 (allowed).
- From event6 pick event3 (allowed).
- From event3 must go to event6, and from event6 we can again pick event3.
- So we can loop: 1 → 6 → 3 → 6 → 3 → 6 → … indefinitely.

This infinite trace never contains event7, so C1 (""Event7 always happens"") is false on that trace. Moreover C1 never becomes true later on that trace (there is no later point from which every future event is 7). Also, note that C1 is impossible to satisfy by requiring every step to be event7 because after any event7 the next event must be event4, so ""always event7"" can't hold globally anyway.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- C1 says ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/event).
- But the rules require that after event7 the next event must be event4. Thus any occurrence of event7 is immediately followed by event4, so you cannot have event7 at every step.
- Therefore C1 is impossible, so it cannot become true at some later time. Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Start at event6. From 6 we may choose 7. From 7 choose 2. From 2 choose 3. From 3 choose 7. This yields the infinite cycle 6 → 7 → 2 → 3 → 7 → 2 → 3 → ….
- None of the events in that cycle is event5, and the choices used are all allowed by the given rules (3 → 7 is allowed, 2 → 3 is allowed, 7 → 2 is allowed).
- Hence there exists a valid infinite execution that never reaches event5, so “Event5 eventually happens” is not guaranteed.
Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says “event5 eventually happens.” C2 says “C1 does not hold” (i.e. event5 does not inevitably occur).
- From the rules we have transitions: 6 -> {4,7}; 7 -> {2,3,5,6}; 6 -> 7 and 7 -> 6 are allowed.
- Starting at the initial event6, one can choose 7, then choose 6, then 7, then 6, ... forever. This produces an infinite 6↔7 loop that never visits event5.
- Because there is a valid (infinite) trace that never reaches event5, event5 is not guaranteed to eventually happen. Thus C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 the rules allow either event4 or event7 next.
- There is a consistent way to avoid event5 forever: choose event7 after event6, then choose event6 after event7, and repeat the 6 -> 7 -> 6 cycle. All choices in that cycle (6 -> 7, 7 -> 6) are permitted by the rules, so an infinite trace without event5 exists. Thus C1 (""event5 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed.
- But C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event5 never happens). That is also not entailed, because other permitted choices can lead to event5 (for example 6 -> 4 -> 5 or 6 -> 7 -> 5).
- Because the rules allow both traces that include event5 and traces that avoid it, we cannot conclude C2. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event6 (given).
- From event6 one allowed next is event1.
- From event1 one allowed next is event6.
- Thus the sequence 6 → 1 → 6 → 1 → ... obeys all ""after"" rules and never visits event4.
- Therefore C1 (""event4 does not happen"") is possible, so the antecedent of C2 can be true while the consequent (""event4 happens"") is false.
- Hence the implication in C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" (i.e. not event4 implies event4).
- From the rules: initially event6 happens. After event6 one allowed next event is event1 (6 → 1). After event1 one allowed next event is event6 (1 → 6). Both choices avoid event4.
- So there is a valid sequence 6 → 1 → 6 → 1 → ... that never includes event4. This satisfies C1 while event4 never happens.
- Therefore C1 does not imply event4; the conditional in C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Start: initially event6 happened.
2. We can follow allowed transitions while avoiding event4:
   - After 6 choose event1 (allowed: 1,4,5).
   - After 1 choose event2 (allowed: 2,4,5,6).
   - After 2 choose event3 (allowed: 1,3,4,5,6).
   - After 3 choose event7 (allowed: 1,2,4,5,7).
   - After 7 event6 must happen (allowed: 6).
3. That gives the loop 6 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 7 → 6, which uses only events {1,2,3,6,7} and never uses event4. Repeating this cycle indefinitely yields a valid execution where event4 does not happen, so C1 can be true.
4. C2 says “if C1 holds (event4 does not happen), then event4 happens.” Since we have a valid scenario where C1 is true and event4 does not happen, the implication is false.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to decide whether ""If event6 eventually happens (C1), then event2 happens"" (C2).

Write the transition relation (from the context):
- 1 → {2,4,5,6}
- 2 → {3,5,6,7}
- 3 → {2,4,5,6}
- 4 → {1,2,3,5,7}  (initial state is 4)
- 5 → {3,4}
- 6 → {1,2,3,4,5,7}
- 7 → {2,3,5}

We need to know whether every run that contains a 6 must contain a 2 somewhere. To disprove the implication it suffices to exhibit a valid run that contains a 6 but never contains a 2.

From the initial 4 we can choose 4 → 1 (avoiding 2), then 1 → 6 (avoiding 2). From 6 we can go back to 1 (6 → 1) and repeat 1 → 6 forever. Thus an infinite run exists:
4, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, ...
This run contains event6 but never contains event2. Therefore the implication is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event is 4.
- From event4 you may go to event1 (rule: after 4 → {1,2,3,5,7}).
- From event1 you may go to event6 (rule: after 1 → {2,4,5,6}). So we can reach event6 (C1 holds).
- From event6 you may go back to event1 (rule: after 6 → {1,2,3,4,5,7}), and then again to event6, etc. The cycle 1 ↔ 6 is allowed and never requires event2.
- Thus there is a valid execution where event6 occurs but event2 never occurs. That is a counterexample to the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Counterexample (starting from the initial event4): 4 -> 1 -> 6. These transitions are allowed (after 4 can go to 1; after 1 can go to 6). From 6 you can continue without ever taking event2 (e.g. 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> ...), so there is a run in which event6 occurs but event2 never occurs. Therefore ""if event6 eventually happens then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e. from the current state, event2 will occur in the immediately following state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the next state, C1 is true. That means two steps from now (the state after the next), event2 must occur.

Step 2 — start from the initial condition:
- Initially event4 happened.

Step 3 — possible next-state(s) from event4:
- After event4, the rules say the next state must be either event1 or event5. So the state at time1 is either event1 or event5.

Step 4 — what can happen at time2 in each case?
- If time1 = event1, then after event1 the next state (time2) can be event2 or event5. So event2 is possible but not forced (time2 could be event5).
- If time1 = event5, then after event5 the next state (time2) can be event2, event4, or event6. Again event2 is possible but not forced (time2 could be event4 or event6).

Step 5 — counterexample showing C2 fails:
- Choose the trace: time0 = event4, time1 = event1, time2 = event5. This complies with all rules but at time2 event2 does not occur. Thus it is not guaranteed that event2 occurs two steps from the initial state.

Conclusion:
C2 is False.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules for ""after event4"" state the next event must be either event1 or event5.
- Therefore the immediate next state cannot be event2.
- C1 asserts ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — this is false.
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., that event2 happens next) — also false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypotheses: C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state."" C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., two steps from the initial state, event2 must occur).
- From the initial event4, the rules allow only event1 or event5 in the next state (after event4 → {event1, event5}). So C1 is already not guaranteed in the immediate next state.
- Evaluate C2: from event1 the following state can be event2 or event5; from event5 the following state can be event2, event4, or event6. Thus event2 is possible two steps out but not guaranteed (there are branches that avoid event2).
- Because event2 is not forced in all possible two-step continuations, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state; therefore C2 is false."

Reasoning:
- Start: event2 happens, so event7 must happen next (2 -> 7).
- From event7 we may choose event4 (7 -> 4).
- From event4 we may choose event1 (4 -> 1).
- From event1 we may choose event4 again (1 -> 4).

Thus there is a valid infinite trace: 2, 7, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, ... in which event7 occurs only once (and then never again). Therefore ""Event7 always happens"" (C1) is false, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false.

False

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The context explicitly says ""After event7, no other events can happen."" Therefore there is no next event after the initial event7.
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false because no event can occur after event7.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and event7 to happen). Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — interpret rules:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The rules state ""After event7, no other events can happen."" (repeated).
Thus once event7 has occurred, the sequence terminates; there is no next event.

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Because event7 occurred initially and no events can occur after event7, there is no next-state event, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event7 happens."" C1 is false, so the conjunction is false (even though event7 did happen initially).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Starting node is event7. From the rules, the directed transitions are:
  7 -> {1,3,5}
  1 -> {2,5,6}
  2 -> {5,7}
  3 -> {1,2,4,5}
  4 -> {1,2,3,5}
  5 -> {2,3,4,7}
  6 -> {3,4}
- Note: the only rule that produces event6 is 1 -> 6. No other event leads to 6.
- If C1 holds (event1 does not happen), then 6 cannot be reached because its only predecessor (event1) is forbidden.
- A concrete counterexample path that avoids event1 (and thus avoids event6) is:
  7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> ... (a cycle among 7,3,2,5)
  This sequence never contains event1 or event6, so C2 (""If C1 then event6"") is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event6 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is implied by the given transition rules.

Step 2 — examine transitions
From the rules (deduplicated):
- 7 -> {1, 3, 5}
- 1 -> {2, 5, 6}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 4, 5}
- 5 -> {2, 3, 4, 7}
- 2 -> {5, 7}
- 6 -> {3, 4}
- 4 -> {1, 2, 3, 5}

Note: the only way to reach event6 is via 1 -> 6. No other event has 6 as a successor.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample
Start at the initial event7 and avoid event1:
- 7 -> 3 (allowed)
- 3 -> 2 (allowed)
- 2 -> 7 (allowed)
Then repeat the cycle 7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 ... forever. This sequence never includes event1, and therefore never includes event6 (since 6 is only reachable from 1).

Conclusion
C2 is not guaranteed by the rules (there exists a valid sequence where C1 holds and event6 does not occur).

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Interpret the rules as a directed graph of possible next events:
  - 7 -> {1,3,5}
  - 1 -> {2,5,6}
  - 3 -> {1,2,4,5}
  - 5 -> {2,3,4,7}
  - 2 -> {5,7}
  - 6 -> {3,4}
  - 4 -> {1,2,3,5}
- C1 says event1 never happens. If event1 never happens, any edge leaving 1 (including 1 -> 6) can never be taken.
- Observe: the only incoming edge to 6 is from 1. So if 1 never occurs, 6 can never occur.
- Also observe there are choices from 7 that avoid 1 (e.g. choose 5 or 3). From 5,2,3,4,7 you can cycle indefinitely without ever visiting 1 or 6 (for example 7 → 5 → 2 → 5 → 3 → 5 → 7 ...).
- Thus there is a valid execution where C1 holds (event1 never happens) and event6 also never happens. That makes the implication ""if C1 then event6"" false.

Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C1: ""If event4 happens, then event2 happens."" That asserts event2 must follow every occurrence of event4.
- From the context: after event4 the allowed next events are either event5 or event6. These are nondeterministic choices, not obligations to produce event2.
- There exists a valid trace that starts at event4 and never produces event2, for example:
  event4 → event5 → event1 → event4 → event5 → event1 → ... 
  (event5 can go to event1, event1 can go back to event4, and this loop can repeat indefinitely without ever choosing event6 or event2).
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (it is false).
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event3 to happen. Since C1 fails (and event3 is not forced either), C2 is false.

Thus the correct answer is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step, brief):

- Starting fact: event4 happens.
- From event4 the rules allow either event5 or event6 next.
- If we always choose the 5-branch, the rules allow a 4↔5 loop: 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 … (since 5 can lead back to 4). That infinite loop never produces event2.
- If we choose the 6-branch but then choose 6 → 7 → 4 (possible), we can return to the same 4 and again avoid 2 indefinitely.
- Thus there are valid continuations from event4 that never produce event2. Therefore the implication ""If event4 happens, then event2 happens"" (C1) does not hold.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (C1 holds and event3 happens) is also false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event4 happens, then event2 happens."" To refute this it suffices to exhibit a possible sequence starting from event4 that never produces event2.
- Initially event4 happened. The rules allow: after event4 -> event5 (or event6). After event5 -> event4 (or event1). So one possible infinite trace is: event4 → event5 → event4 → event5 → ... This trace never produces event2 (nor event3).
- Therefore C1 is not entailed by the premises. Since C2 asserts C1 holds and event3 happens, C2 is also not entailed.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- The hypothesis C2 asserts that event1, event6, and event3 all happen.
- From the context: initially event1 happens. After event1 one of {2,3,5,6} must happen, so event6 can occur after event1.
- After event6 one of {2,5,7} must happen; choosing event7 is allowed and event7 is terminal (no further events).
- Thus a valid sequence is 1 → 6 → 7, which includes event1 and event6 but does not include event3.
- Because there is a permitted sequence where event3 does not occur, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- The context only guarantees event1 initially.
- After event1 one of {event2, event3, event5, event6} must happen, so event6 is possible but not mandatory.
- C2 requires both event6 and event3 to occur. These are not forced to both occur by the rules.
- Counterexample run consistent with the rules where C2 fails: event1 → event6 → event7 (after event7 nothing else happens). This run has event1 and event6 but not event3, so C2 is not entailed.

Therefore C2 is False.

- C2 asserts: event1 and event6 happen (that's C1) and additionally event3 happens.

Step 2 — check the rules and find a valid sequence
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event6 is allowed (after event1 → one of {event2, event3, event5, event6}).
- After event6, event5 is allowed (after event6 → one of {event2, event5, event7}).
- After event5, event3 is allowed (after event5 → one of {event1, event3, event6, event7}).

Thus one valid sequence is: event1 → event6 → event5 → event3 (and after event3 event4 must follow, but that does not prevent event3 from having occurred).

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since such a sequence satisfies that event1, event6, and event3 all happen, C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 occurs.
- From event7 one allowed next event is event6 (7 -> 6).
- From event6 one allowed next event is event5 (6 -> 5).
- Therefore there exists a run 7 then 6 such that at the state where event6 holds, the next state has event5 — so C1 (event5 happens in the next state) holds at that state.
- Hence C1 does eventually hold along that execution, so C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- C1 says “Event5 always happens.” Interpreting this as “from some point onward every event that occurs is event5” (the usual reading of “always happens” as a persistent property), that would require there to be a state after which the only possible next event is event5 (and thus every subsequent event must be 5).

- Look at the transition rules: no event has event5 as its only successor.
  - event7 -> {event1, event5} (non‑deterministic)
  - event5 -> {event1, event7}
  - event1 -> {event4}
  - event4 -> {event2, event7}
  - event2 -> {event4, event6}
  - event6 -> {event2, event3, event4, event7}
  - event3 -> terminal
  So there is no state that forces event5 at every next step, and event5 does not self‑loop.

- Also there exist concrete runs with no event5 at all (counterexample): start event4 -> event2 -> event6 -> event3 (terminal). That run contains no event5, so “event5 always happens” is false on that run, and there is no way to reach a point after which every future event must be event5.

Therefore C2 (“eventually C1 holds”) is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 says ""Event5 always happens"" — that means from some point onward every event occurrence must be event5 (i.e., the trace consists only of event5 at every step).
- Look at the transition rules: after event5 the next event must be event1 or event7. There is no rule allowing event5 to follow event5 directly.
- Therefore it is impossible for every future event slot to be event5 (you cannot have event5 at two consecutive steps). Thus C1 can never be true at any point.
- C2 asserts that C1 will eventually hold (that from some future time onward only event5 occurs). Since C1 can never hold, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event5 always happens."" (read as: from some point onward, at every step event5 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. eventually we reach a point after which every event is event5)

Step 2 — examine the transition rules that matter
- From event4 you can go to event2 or event7.
- From event2 you can go to event4 or event6.
- From event6 you can go to event2,3,4, or7.
- From event3 the run terminates (no further events).
- From event7 you can go to event1 or event5.
- From event1 you must go to event4.
- From event5 you go to event1 or event7.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample run where C1 never becomes true
- Start at the initial event4 (given).
- Choose the cycle 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> ... forever. These transitions are allowed (4→2 and 2→4), so there is an infinite run that visits only events 4 and 2 and never visits event5.
- On that run, event5 never occurs, so it is impossible that at some point ""from then on every event is event5."" Thus C1 never holds on that run, so C1 does not eventually hold in the system.

- C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We must decide whether ""C2: (If event6 happens then event3 happens) AND event7 happens"" is true given the constraints.

Step 1 — C1: If event6 happens, then event3 happens.
- event3 happened initially. That means in every allowed execution/event sequence event3 is already present. Therefore any occurrence of event6 (or anything else) will still have event3 occurring (earlier). So C1 is true.

Step 2 — Does event7 necessarily happen?
- No. From the initial event3, we can choose a path that never produces event7. Example valid path avoiding 7:
  - start with event3 (given) → pick event2 (allowed after 3) → pick event4 (allowed after 2) → pick event5 (allowed after 4) → pick event4 (allowed after 5) → repeat 5↔4 indefinitely.
- All chosen transitions are permitted by the rules, and this path never includes event7. So event7 is not guaranteed to occur.

Therefore C2 (C1 holds AND event7 happens) is false. 

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""if event6 happens then event3 happens"") is true because event3 happened initially, so any occurrence of event6 will be accompanied by the already-happened event3.
- However, event7 is not forced by the rules: from the initial event3 we can choose 3 -> 4, then 4 -> 5, then 5 -> 4, and repeat 4 <-> 5 (or include 6 via 4 -> 6 -> 4, etc.) indefinitely, never taking a transition to 7. Thus event7 need not happen.
- Since C2 requires event7 to happen (in addition to C1), C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis components
- C1: If event6 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event7 happens.

Step 2 — check C1
- The context states “Initially, event3 happened.” So event3 has occurred (at the start).
- Therefore any occurrence of event6 (later) still satisfies “event3 happens” (it already happened). So C1 holds.

Step 3 — check whether event7 must happen (needed for C2)
- From event3 one possible next is event4. From event4 you can go to event5, and from event5 back to event4. Thus there is a valid infinite path 3 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ... that never includes event7.
- Therefore event7 is not guaranteed to happen.

Conclusion
- C1 is true, but event7 need not happen, so the conjunction C2 is not entailed by the context.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens. From the rules, after event3 the next event must be one of {event1, event6, event7}.
- C1 asserts event6 happens in the next state; C2 is ""C1 holds or event7 happens"" (i.e., next state is event6 or event7).
- But the next state could be event1 (allowed). From event1 the system can go to event2 or event5; from event2 it can go back to event1 or to event3 or event5. There is a valid infinite path that avoids event7 (for example: event3 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...), so neither event6 nor event7 is guaranteed in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""Event6 happens in the next state OR event7 happens"") follows from the given facts.

From the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event6, event7}.

C2 requires that the next event is either event6 or event7. But event1 is also a permitted next event. Since event1 could occur instead, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Therefore C2 is False.

- C2 asserts (event6 next) OR (event7 next). That disjunction would fail if event1 happens next.
- Since event1 is an allowed next event, C2 is not entailed by the given information. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules for ""after event4"" allow next = {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6}.
- So event6 is one possible next event (C1 can hold), but it's not guaranteed because event1 (or event2, event3, event5) could be chosen instead.
- Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event6 happens in the next state."" (i.e., the very next event is event6.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every possible next state, event6 happens.)

Step 2 — Examine the conditions / transitions
- We start with event4 having happened.
- The rule for event4: after event4, one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6} must happen next.

Step 3 — Reasoning / counterexample
- From event4, the next event could be event1 (this is explicitly allowed).
- If the next event is event1, then event6 does not occur in that next state, so C1 is false in that branch.

Conclusion
- Because there is at least one allowed next-state (e.g., event1) where event6 does not happen, C1 is not guaranteed in all next states. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event4 occurred.
- From event4 the next event may be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6}.
- Thus event6 is only one possible next event, not guaranteed — for example, event1 is an allowed next event.
- C1 (""Event6 happens in the next state"") is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not necessarily eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine transitions (edges):
- From 6 → {1,2,4,5,7}
- From 1 → {5,6}
- From 2 → {1,4,6,7}
- From 4 → {1,2,5,6}
- From 5 → {1,2,7}
- From 7 → {1,2,3,4}
- From 3 → {1,4}

Step 3 — find a valid infinite run that avoids event3:
- Start at 6, choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 5 (allowed).
- From 5 choose 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 … forever.
This infinite sequence is allowed by the rules and never visits event3.

Conclusion:
- C1 is not guaranteed (false), because there exists an allowed run that never reaches event3.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Answer: True
---
We interpret C1 as the claim ""event3 inevitably (eventually) happens"" from the given initial condition; C2 is the negation ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 is not guaranteed).

From the transitions:
- 6 → {1,2,4,5,7}
- 1 → {5,6}
- 5 → {1,2,7}
- 7 → {1,2,3,4}
- 3 → {1,4}
- 2 → {1,4,6,7}
- 4 → {1,2,5,6}

Starting at 6, there is a reachable cycle that never visits 3: for example 6 → 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... (repeat 1↔5 forever). This infinite run avoids event3, so event3 is not inevitable.

Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Start at event6.
- After event6 one allowed next event is event7.
- After event7 one allowed next event is event3.
- So there is a valid sequence 6 → 7 → 3, which makes ""Event3 eventually happens"" (C1) true in at least one execution.

C2 claims that C1 does not hold (i.e., event3 never happens). Because there exists a valid sequence where event3 does happen, C2 is not true. Therefore C2 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Start: event2 happened.
- From event2 you can go to event3 (one of the allowed choices).
- From event3 you can go to event6 (one of the allowed choices).
- From event6 you can go to event1 (one of the allowed choices).
- From event1 the only option is event6.
- Thus there is a valid infinite run: 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> ... which never visits event5.

C1 says “event5 eventually happens.” The run above shows a possible future in which event5 never occurs, so C1 is not guaranteed (not true in all runs). Since C2 is just “C1 eventually holds” (which is equivalent to C1 here), C2 is also not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Start at the initial event7. From event7 one allowed next event is event1.
- From event1 the only allowed next event is event7.
- So the infinite sequence 7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → ... is allowed by the rules.
- In that sequence event2 never occurs, and event4 never occurs (so ""Event4 always happens"" is false).
- Therefore there exists a valid run where neither C1 holds nor event2 happens, so the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False.
---
We must decide whether the statement C2 (""Event4 always happens"" OR ""event2 happens"") is guaranteed by the given rules and the initial event7.

Interpretation: C1 = ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., event4 occurs in the run), and C2 = (C1) OR (event2 happens). To show C2 is not guaranteed it suffices to give a possible run consistent with the rules in which neither C1 nor event2 holds.

Start: event7. From 7 the allowed next events are {1,2,4,5}. To avoid event2 and event4, choose event1. After event1, the only allowed next event is 7. So we can repeat the cycle 7 -> 1 -> 7 -> 1 -> ... forever. This infinite run is consistent with all rules, never includes event2 and never includes event4. Thus C1 is false on this run (event4 does not happen), and event2 does not happen either. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" — i.e. in every possible run/sequence, event4 will occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — i.e. either event4 is inevitable, or event2 occurs.

Step 2 — inspect the rules and find a counterexample
- Initially we have event7.
- After event7 one allowed successor is event1 (the rule after event7: either event1, event2, event4, or event5).
- After event1 the rule forces event7.
- So the infinite sequence 7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → ... is allowed by the rules.

This sequence never contains event4 and never contains event2.

Step 3 — conclude
- C1 is false (event4 does not always happen; here it never happens in the example run).
- In that same run event2 also never happens, so ""C1 or event2"" is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C1 is the proposition ""event1 happens or event5 happens"". C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., at every step).

But initially event4 happened. At that initial step neither event1 nor event5 occurred, so C1 is already false there. Even ignoring the initial step, from event4 a next event2 is allowed (after event4, event2 may happen), and event2 is neither event1 nor event5, so C1 would be false at that step as well.

Therefore C1 does not always hold. Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 states “Event1 happens or event5 happens.” Interpreting this as a property of the current event (i.e., the current event is either 1 or 5).
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., at every point along the execution, the current event is 1 or 5).
- The system starts with event4 initially. At that initial point the current event is 4, which is neither 1 nor 5, so C1 is already false at the start.
- Therefore C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is the proposition ""Event1 happens or Event5 happens"" (i.e., the current event is either event1 or event5).
- C2 states that C1 always holds (i.e., at every moment the current event is either event1 or event5).
- The initial event given is event4. At that initial moment neither event1 nor event5 occurs, so C1 is false right away.
- Because C1 is false at the initial state, it cannot be true at all times. Therefore C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or event4 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So C1 is false.
- After event1, one of {event5, event6, event7} must happen.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2, event3, event6} must happen.
- (Other transition rules exist but are not needed for the counterexample.)

Step 3 — find a sequence consistent with the rules that makes C2 false:
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1 choose event5 (allowed).
- After event5 choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat: 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... indefinitely.
In this sequence event4 never occurs, and C1 is false (because event1 did happen). Thus C2 (C1 or event4) is false in this valid execution.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed; it can be false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event4 happens"", i.e. (not event1) OR event4. Since C1 is false, C2 is equivalent to ""event4 happens"".
- We only need one valid execution that avoids event4 to show C2 is not guaranteed. From event1 the rules allow event5; from event5 the rules allow event1. Thus a valid infinite trace is 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... which never includes event4.
- In that trace event4 does not happen and C1 is false, so C2 is false (not entailed by the premises).
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""  
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens"" i.e. (not Event1) OR Event4.

Step 2 — check initial facts:
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 does happen, hence C1 is false.

Step 3 — determine whether Event4 must happen:
- From event1 we can choose event5 (allowed). From event5 we can choose event1 (allowed). So the infinite repetition event1 → event5 → event1 → ... is a valid sequence under the rules and never involves event4.
- Therefore Event4 need not happen in all valid runs.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- Since C1 is false (Event1 did happen) and there exists a valid run where Event4 never happens, C2 is not guaranteed and can be false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 claims: whenever event6 happens, event3 happens next.
- The rules for after event6 say: next can be event1, event2, event3, event5, or event7 — event3 is only one possible outcome, not required.
- Counterexample sequence from the given rules:
  - Initially event3 happens.
  - After event3 we may choose event1.
  - After event1 we may choose event6.
  - After event6 we may choose event1 (allowed).
  In this sequence event6 occurs but is not followed by event3, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: after event6, the allowed next events include 1,2,3,5,7 — event3 is not forced.
- Construct a valid sequence that violates C1 (i.e., shows event6 can happen without event3 happening):
  1. Initially event3 occurs (given).
  2. After event3 choose event1 (allowed).
  3. After event1 choose event6 (allowed). Now event6 has happened.
  4. After event6 choose event1 (allowed). This avoids event3.
  5. Repeat steps 3–4 (1 → 6 → 1 → 6 …). This infinite cycle never produces event3.

Because such a legal sequence exists where event6 occurs and event3 does not, the statement ""If event6 happens, then event3 happens"" (C1) does not hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts: whenever event6 happens, event3 happens (i.e. event6 → event3).
- From the rules, after event6 the allowed next events are {event1, event2, event3, event5, event7} — event3 is an option but not forced.
- We can exhibit a valid trace (starting from the given initial event3) that reaches event6 and then never produces event3:
  - Start: event3 (initial).
  - From event3 → event1 (allowed).
  - From event1 → event4 (allowed).
  - From event4 → event6 (allowed). Now event6 has occurred.
  - From event6 → event1 (choose to avoid event3), then event1 → event4, then event4 → event6, and repeat the cycle 6 → 1 → 4 → 6 indefinitely. This cycle never produces event3.
- Because there is a valid sequence where event6 occurs and event3 does not occur afterward, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. Interpret C1 (""Event4 happens and event4 happens"") as simply ""event4 holds (now)"". Then C2 asserts that event4 holds in every reachable state (i.e., is invariant).

Step-by-step:
- Initially event7 happened.
- From the rule ""After event7, event4 must happen"", the next event must be event4. So there is a state where event4 holds (C1 is true there).
- But after event4, one allowed next event is event1 (""After event4, either event1, event2, event5, or event7 must happen""). So a possible sequence is: event7 (initial) → event4 → event1.
- In the state where event1 has just happened, event4 does not hold, so C1 is false in that state. Therefore C1 is not true in all states.

Thus C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False. Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Hypothesis C1 is simply that event4 happens (the conjunct is redundant).
- Initially event7 happens (given).
- The rules state: after event7, event4 must happen. Therefore event4 necessarily occurs immediately after the initial event7.
- Because that requirement is mandatory, in every possible run starting from the given initial condition event4 will occur. Hence C1 holds in all possible executions.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Sample responses:
C2 asserts that ""Event3 happens in the next state"" holds always (in every state).

Look at the rules: initially event2 happened, and after event2 either event3 or event5 must happen. That means the next state could be event5, so event3 is not guaranteed. Also, after event7 the next event can be event1 or event5 (neither is event3), so many states do not force event3 next.

Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

False

Goal: determine whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. in every state the next event must be event3.

Examine the transitions. Initially event2 happened. From event2 the allowed next events are {event3, event5}. That means from the initial state the next event might be event5 (not necessarily event3). Thus C1 is not guaranteed in the initial state. Concretely: initial path event2 → event5 is allowed, so C1 is false on that path; therefore C2 (which requires C1 in all states/paths) is false.

Answer: False
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event2 occurs. The rule ""After event2, either event3 or event5 must happen"" makes event3 a possible next event but does not force it (event5 could happen instead). Thus C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is not guaranteed, and so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (counterexample: choose event5 as the next event)."

We want to know whether ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is true.

1) Identify hypotheses:
- C1: If event3 happens, then event5 happens.
- C2 (to evaluate): If C1 holds, then event4 happens.

2) Key facts from the context:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5 one of {event1, event2, event3, event4, event7} must happen.
- After event1 event5 must happen.
(Other rules exist, but these two suffice for a counterexample.)

3) Construct a valid trace consistent with the context and with C1:
- Start: event5 (given).
- From event5 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we must get event5 (given).
- Repeat: event5 → event1 → event5 → ... This infinite loop is allowed by the rules and never produces event4. C1 (which only constrains what happens after event3) is never invoked and causes no contradiction.

Thus even assuming C1 is true, event4 need not happen. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: “Event6 happens and event3 happens” (both occur at some point).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” — i.e., eventually both event6 and event3 will have occurred.

Step 2 — interpret the task
- We check whether, given the initial event and the “after … must happen” rules, C2 is guaranteed on all possible event sequences (universal / inevitability reading).

Step 3 — examine rules and give a counterexample
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4, it is allowed to go to event3.
- From event3, the rules force either event5 or event7. If event5 happens, then “after event5, no other events can happen” — the run terminates.
- Thus the run 4 → 3 → 5 is a valid sequence that ends with event5 and never reaches event6. It contains event3 but not event6, so C1 never becomes true on that run.

Conclusion
- Because there exists at least one valid run (4 → 3 → 5) where C1 does not eventually hold, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 occurs. After event4 one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- Take the branch event4 → event3. After event3 one of {event5, event7} must happen.
- If event5 is chosen, then ""after event5, no other events can happen"" — the run terminates. That run contains event3 but never event6.
- C1 requires both event6 and event3 to have happened. The run event4 → event3 → event5 shows C1 need not hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed by the given conditions. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event4 occurred. From event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- C1 requires both event6 and event3 to happen (at some points).
- Consider the concrete run 4 → 3 → 5:
  - From 4 choose event3.
  - From event3 one possible next is event5.
  - After event5 no other events can happen (terminal).
  - In this run event3 happened but event6 never occurs, so C1 never becomes true.
- Because there exists a possible run (the one above) where C1 never holds, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- From the rules: 2 -> {4,5,6,7}, and 4 -> {1,2,7}, and 1 -> {4,7}.
- Start with the initial event2 and choose 2 -> 4 (allowed).
- From 4 choose 4 -> 1 (allowed), then 1 -> 4 (allowed). This yields an infinite loop 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 ... that never produces event6.
- Therefore it is possible for event4 to happen without event6 ever occurring, so ""If event4 happens, then event6 happens"" is not always true.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1: ""If event4 happens, then event6 happens"" means every allowed continuation after an occurrence of event4 must eventually produce event6.
- From the rules: 2 -> {4,5,6,7}, 4 -> {1,2,7}, 1 -> {4,7}, etc.
- Starting from the initial event2, take 2 -> 4 (so event4 happens).
- From 4 choose 4 -> 1, and then 1 -> 4, and repeat 4 -> 1 -> 4 indefinitely. All these transitions are allowed by the rules.
- In that infinite run event6 never occurs, so event4 does not force event6.

Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, ""After eventX, either A, B, or C must happen"" means one of those next events may occur nondeterministically.
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 one possible next event is event4.
- After event4 a possible next event is event1.
- After event1 a possible next event is event4.
- Thus there is a valid infinite sequence: event2 → event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... that never includes event6.
- Because it's possible for event4 to occur without event6 ever occurring, the implication ""If event4 happens, then event6 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the initial event1 the next event can be 3, 4, or 5.
- From 3,4,5 one can choose transitions that avoid event2 forever (for example: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...), since all those states have successors that stay within {1,3,4,5,6,7} without ever taking 2.
- Thus ""event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed from the next state (it is avoidable), so C2 is false.
---

---
Reasoning

- Initial event is event1. C2 asserts: “In the next state, C1 holds,” where C1 = “event2 eventually happens.”
- After event1 the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- To show C2 is false it suffices to exhibit a possible continuation from the next state that avoids event2 forever.
- Take the next state = event3 (allowed). From event3 you may choose event4 (allowed). From event4 you may choose event1 (allowed). From event1 you may choose event3 again, and repeat the cycle event1 → event3 → event4 → event1 → … indefinitely.
- This infinite cycle never includes event2, so from that next state event2 does not eventually happen on that execution. Hence C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rules state: after event3, event2 must happen. That means the very next state is event2 (no alternative).
- C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state; this contradicts the mandatory 3 → 2 transition, so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and event7 to happen). Since C1 is false, C2 is false as well.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify initial state:
- Initially event3 happened.

Step 2 — look at possible next events after event3:
- The context says “After event3, event2 must happen.” That is deterministic: the next state after event3 is event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 claims event1 happens in the next state. But the next state is event2, so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event7 to happen; since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: C1 holds and event7 happens.

Step 2 — Apply the rules from the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. Therefore the next state after the initial state is event2 (deterministically).

Step 3 — Consequences:
- Since the immediate next state is event2, event1 does not happen in that next state. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold, so C2 cannot be true (regardless of whether event7 can occur later).

Votes: {'False': 2, 'True': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is already satisfied because event1 happened initially.
- C2 requires event6 to happen as well. From event1 the possible next events are {event2, event5, event6, event7}, so event6 can happen but is not forced.
- There exist valid infinite sequences that never include event6 (for example: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ...). All transitions in that cycle are allowed and avoid event6, so event6 is not inevitable.
- Thus although C1 holds, event6 need not occur, so the conjunction in C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False.
---
The hypothesis C2 says: ""Event6 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

- Initially event1 happened, so C1 is already true.
- After event1, one allowed next event is event6 (the rules permit event6 immediately after event1).

Therefore there is a valid sequence (event1 initially, then event6) in which event6 happens and C1 holds. So C2 can be satisfied.

Answer: True
---
First, identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: Event6 happens and C1 holds.

Given the initial condition, event1 happened already, so C1 is true (event1 has occurred). Thus C2 is equivalent to ""Event6 happens"" (because C1 already holds).

Now examine the transition rules and look for a possible execution that avoids event6. From the rules:
- After event1, one of {event2, event5, event6, event7} must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4, event6} must happen.

Consider this allowed infinite trace:
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...
- After each event1 we choose event2 (allowed).
- After each event2 we choose event1 (allowed).
This trace never contains event6, yet it is consistent with all given rules. C1 holds (event1 occurs repeatedly), but event6 never occurs.

Because there exists a valid execution consistent with the rules in which event6 does not happen, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step, with a counterexample trace):

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event7 happens and event4 happens.""
- C2 asserts C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible execution from the given initial condition).

From the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event can be 2, 5, 6, or 7.
- After event2, the next event can be 1 or 3.

Consider the infinite trace that always picks the 2→1 loop:
1 (initial) → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ...
- This trace is allowed by the rules (1→2 and 2→1 are permitted repeatedly).
- In this trace, neither event7 nor event4 ever occurs.

Because there exists a valid execution in which C1 is false, C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 = (event7 happens and event4 happens).

Start: event1 happens. From the rules the system is non-deterministic (each ""after X, either ... must happen"" gives several possible next events). To refute ""always"", it suffices to produce one valid run (sequence) consistent with the rules in which C1 does not hold.

Consider this valid infinite run:
- event1 (initial) → choose event2 (allowed since after 1 one may choose 2)
- event2 → choose event1 (allowed since after 2 one may choose 1)
- repeat: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

All transitions respect the given rules. In this run, neither event7 nor event4 ever occurs, so C1 is false in this run. Therefore C1 does not hold on all possible runs.

Conclusion: C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, one of {event2, event5, event6, event7} must happen. Choose event2.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3} must happen. Choose event1.
- Repeat: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 ... is a valid infinite sequence consistent with the rules.
- In that sequence neither event7 nor event4 ever occurs, so ""Event7 happens and event4 happens"" is not guaranteed in all possible runs.

Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C1 is equivalent to ""Event6 happens"" (it's event6 OR event6). C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., event6 always happens).

From the rules and the initial condition:
- Initially event4 happens, and after event4 event7 must happen.
- From event7 the next event must be one of {2,3,4,5}.
- From those events the allowed successors are among {1,2,3,4,5,7} per the given rules (and the rules are repeated but give no new incoming edges).
- Nowhere in the rules is any event that leads to event6; event6 only appears as a source (after event6 → {1,2,3,4}) and has no incoming transition.

Therefore event6 is unreachable from the initial event4, so C1 does not hold, and hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event6 happens or event6 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event6 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""Event6 always happens (in every possible run)"".

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and transition rules
- Initial event: event4 has happened.
- Transitions given (summarized):
  - after 4 → 7 (must)
  - after 7 → one of {2,3,4,5}
  - after 2 → one of {1,3,7}
  - after 3 → one of {2,4,5,7}
  - after 5 → one of {2,3}
  - after 1 → one of {2,3}
  - after 6 → one of {1,2,3,4}

Step 3 — reason about reachability of event6
- From the initial 4 we must go to 7, then to {2,3,4,5}, and so on.
- None of the listed transitions has event6 as a possible successor; the only rule mentioning event6 is the outgoing rule ""after 6 → …"".
- Because there is no incoming transition to event6 from any reachable event, event6 cannot occur in any run that starts from the given initial event4.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event6 happens"") is false (event6 is unreachable).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event6 happens or event6 happens"", which is just Event6 (a tautological duplicate).
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""Event6 always happens"" (in all possible runs).

Step 2 — examine the rules and reachability
- Initial event is event4.
- After event4, event7 must occur.
- After event7, the next event must be one of {2,3,4,5}.
- None of the rules ever produce event6 as a next event. The only rule mentioning event6 is ""after event6, ..."", which gives outgoing transitions from 6, not incoming transitions to 6.

Step 3 — conclude
- Since there is no transition that can lead to event6 from the initial state (or from any reachable event), event6 is not forced to occur — in fact it cannot occur in any run starting from the given initial event4.
- Therefore C1 is not always true, so C2 is false.

We need to check whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true. C1 is ""event1 happens and event4 happens"", so C2 is equivalent to: whenever event1 happens, event4 also happens (event1 ⇒ event4).

Start is event1. From event1 the rules allow either event6 or event7 next.
- If we choose event6, the rules force event1 next (event6 → event1). That returns us to the same choice (event1 → event6 or event7). Thus there is a possible execution that loops: event1, event6, event1, event6, ... and never produces event4.
- Because such a valid sequence contains event1 but never event4, event1 does not guarantee event4.

Therefore C2 is false.

So starting at event1 we can choose event6, then must return to event1, then choose event6 again, etc. This produces a valid execution that never produces event4. Thus event4 is not guaranteed whenever event1 happens, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We need to evaluate C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event1 happens and event4 happens."" So C2 says: whenever event1 happens, event4 must also happen.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens (given).
- After event1, the rules allow either event6 or event7.
- If event6 happens, then after event6 event1 must happen (6 → 1). So one possible infinite trace is 1 → 6 → 1 → 6 → ... (always choosing 6 after each 1).
- In that trace event4 never occurs (we never choose 7, hence never reach 7 → 4).
- Therefore it is possible for event1 to happen while event4 does not happen.

Because there exists a valid sequence where event1 occurs but event4 does not, the implication ""if event1 then (event1 and event4)"" is not guaranteed. So C2 is False.

False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event3 happened. So the immediate next state must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- C2 asserts that C1 (""event7 eventually happens"") holds in the next state. Interpreting this as requiring that from every possible next state, event7 will eventually occur.
- Consider next state = event1. From event1 we can choose event2; from event2 we can choose event1; and so on. The infinite loop event1 → event2 → event1 → ... never visits event7. Thus from event1 there is a path that avoids event7 forever, so ""event7 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed from event1.
- Because at least one possible next state (e.g. event1) does not ensure eventual event7, C2 is false.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the initial event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- Check each immediate successor:
  - If event1 occurs: event1 → event2 (or event5 or event6) and event2 → event7 is possible, also event5 → event7 and event6 → event7 are possible. So there is a path event1 → ... → event7 (e.g., 1 → 2 → 7).
  - If event2 occurs: event2 → event7 directly.
  - If event4 occurs: event4 → event7 directly (one of its options).
- Thus in every possible next state (1, 2, or 4) there is a future path that reaches event7. Therefore ""event7 eventually happens"" (C1) holds in the next state."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened. The rule ""After event7, event3 must happen"" forces the next state to be event3.
- C1 asserts ""Event6 happens in the next state."" But the next state is event3, not event6, so C1 is false now.
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state (which is event3) C1 is true, meaning that from event3 the following state must be event6. The rules for event3 say ""either event4, event6, or event7 must happen"" — event6 is only one possible outcome, not guaranteed.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — interpret the formulas:
- C1: ""Event6 happens in the next state"" — evaluated at a state s, C1 is true iff the immediate successor of s is event6.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — evaluated at the initial state s0, C2 is true iff in s0's successor s1, C1 is true; equivalently, iff event6 happens in s2 (two steps from s0).

Step 2 — follow the given transitions from the initial state:
- Initially event7 happened (state s0 = event7). The rules say after event7, event3 must happen, so s1 = event3 (deterministic).
- From event3, the rule is: next event is one of {4, 6, 7}. So s2 could be 4, or 6, or 7.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires that s2 is event6 for sure. But from s1 = event3, s2 might be 4 or 7 (not only 6). Thus event6 at s2 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true given the rules. Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:

- Initially event7 happened.
- The rules state that after event7, event3 must happen. Therefore the next state is event3.
- C1 claims ""Event6 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at that next state). But we know the next state is event3, so C1 is false at the current state.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — that means at the next state (which is event3), C1 would have to be true there (i.e., from event3, event6 must happen in the following state). After event3, the allowed next events are event4, event6, or event7, so event6 is possible but not guaranteed. Thus C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is not true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event1. To avoid event3 happening, from event1 choose event6 (allowed by ""after event1, either event2, event3, or event6 must happen"").
- From event6 choose event4 (allowed by ""after event6, either event4, or event5 must happen"").
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed by ""after event4, either event1, event5, or event7 must happen"").
- Repeat the cycle 1 → 6 → 4 → 1 → ... forever.

This infinite run contains neither event2 nor event3, so C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false and event3 does not happen. Thus the disjunction ""event3 happens or C1 holds"" (C2) can be false, so C2 is not true.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 says ""Event2 always happens."" To disprove a universal claim it suffices to give one valid run where event2 never occurs.

- Start at the initial event1. From event1 we may choose event6 (allowed: after event1 → event2, event3, or event6). From event6 we may choose event5 (allowed: after event6 → event4 or event5). From event5 we may choose event6 (allowed: after event5 → event1 or event6). Thus we can follow the infinite (or finite repeating) sequence:
  event1 → event6 → event5 → event6 → event5 → ...
  This run never visits event2 (nor event3). Therefore C1 is false.

- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 would only be true if ""Event3 happens"" were guaranteed in every run. But the counterexample run above also never visits event3, so ""Event3 happens"" is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The rules define nondeterministic transitions from each event. Initial event is event1.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") would require every possible run to include event2. This is false: from event1 you can go to event6, then 6→4, 4→7, 7→6 and repeat the cycle 6→4→7→6 indefinitely. That run never visits event2, so C1 is false.
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is false, C2 would require that event3 necessarily happens in every run. But the same counterexample run above (1→6→4→7→6→...) also never visits event3, so the disjunction is false on that run.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First note C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens or event4 happens"" (since C1 is ""event1 or event4"", and C2 = C1 or event4 collapses to the same).

We need to check whether, given the rules and the initial event2, event1 or event4 must inevitably occur. Construct a valid run that avoids both:

- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event7 must happen: 2 -> 7.
- From event7 choose event3 (allowed): 7 -> 3.
- From event3 choose event2 (allowed): 3 -> 2.
- Now repeat: 2 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2 -> ... indefinitely.

All transitions used are allowed by the rules, and this infinite execution never produces event1 or event4. Therefore event1 or event4 is not guaranteed by the premises, so C2 does not necessarily hold.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C2 is guaranteed by the premises.

First simplify C2:
- C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event4 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event4 happens) = (event1) OR (event4). So C2 is simply ""event1 or event4 happens.""

Now check whether that must hold given the rules and the start event.

- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event7 must happen → sequence: 2 → 7.
- After event7, one of {3,4,5} must happen. It is allowed to choose 3.
- After event3, one of {1,2,5,7} must happen. It is allowed to choose 2.

So there is a legal infinite loop: 2 → 7 → 3 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 2 → ... which never includes event1 or event4. Because such a run exists consistent with all premises in which neither event1 nor event4 ever occurs, C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed).

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C2 is ""(Event1 or Event4) or Event4"", which simplifies to ""Event1 or Event4"" (same as C1).
- From the rules there is a possible infinite cycle that never produces Event1 or Event4: start with Event2 (given) → Event7 (must) → choose Event3 (allowed) → choose Event2 (allowed) → repeat. Also 7 → 5 → 2 or 3 keeps you in the same loop. This sequence (2 → 7 → 3 → 2 → ...) never yields Event1 or Event4.
- Since there is at least one valid evolution where neither Event1 nor Event4 ever happens, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Initially event4 happened, so event4 is true.
- The rules are nondeterministic (""either A, B, or C must happen""), so one of the listed successors must occur but not necessarily all.
- From event4 you can choose event1. From event1 you can choose event4 again. This yields a valid sequence: event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ...
- In that sequence event4 repeatedly happens, but neither event6 nor event3 ever needs to occur.
- Therefore C1 (event4 and event6) is not guaranteed, and so C2 (event3 and C1) is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 has happened, so ""event4 happens"" is true.
- The rules are non-deterministic ""either ... or ..."" obligations: after an event one of the listed next events must happen, but not necessarily all.
- From event4 you can choose event1 (since after 4 one of {1,2,5} must occur). From event1 you can choose event4 (since after 1 one of {2,4,5} must occur). Repeating 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 ... satisfies all rules indefinitely.
- In that run neither event6 nor event3 ever occurs, so event6 is not forced by the premises.
- C1 requires event6 to happen (together with event4), so C1 need not hold. Therefore C2 (which requires C1 and event3) is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reason: From the initial event4 you can produce a trace that contains event6 and event3 (for example 4 → 5 → 6 → 3), so C2 is possible, but it is not forced by the rules. There are valid continuations that never produce 6 or 3 (for example 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → …), so ""Event3 happens and Event4 and Event6 happen"" does not necessarily follow. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed — False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event6 happens."" This requires that whenever event3 occurs, event6 must (eventually) occur.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Both parts must be true.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- From 3 you may go to 4, 5, or 6 (3 -> {4,5,6}).
- From 4 you may go to 3, 6, or 7 (4 -> {3,6,7}).
- From 5 you may go to 2, 4, or 7 (5 -> {2,4,7}).
- From 6 you may go to 1,2,3,4, or 5 (6 -> {1,2,3,4,5}).
- From 1 you may go to 3,6, or 7 (1 -> {3,6,7}).
- From 2 you may go to 3,5, or 6 (2 -> {3,5,6}).
- (Some rules are repeated but give the same choices.)

Step 3 — counterexample to C1
- Starting at the initial 3, take the allowed transition 3 -> 4.
- Then take 4 -> 3.
- Repeat 3 -> 4 -> 3 indefinitely.
- This infinite trace is consistent with the given rules and never produces event6.
Therefore C1 (""if 3 happens then 6 happens"") is not guaranteed by the rules.

Step 4 — C2 evaluation
- C1 is false, and event1 is not forced by the rules (it can be avoided), so ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 requires both: (C1) ""If event3 happens then event6 happens"" and (event1 happens).
- From the context, after event3 one of {4,5,6} must happen — nondeterministically, not necessarily event6.
- Counterexample path starting from the initial event3:
  - Choose event4 after event3.
  - From event4 choose event7.
  - After event7 event4 must happen, and you can repeat 4 → 7 → 4 → 7 … forever.
- This infinite loop never produces event6, so C1 (""event3 implies event6"") is false (event3 can occur without event6 ever occurring). Also event1 can only occur after event6 (no rule produces event1 except after event6), so event1 need not occur either.
- Therefore C2 (event1 happens and C1 holds) is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 asserts both (a) event1 happens, and (b) C1 holds, where C1 is ""if event3 happens then event6 happens.""
- From the context we know: initially event3 happens, and the allowed immediate successors are 3 → {4,5,6} and 4 → {3,6,7}, etc.
- A counterexample trace that satisfies all given conditions but makes C2 false is:
  - Start: event3 (given).
  - Choose after 3 → event4 (allowed).
  - After 4 → choose event3 (allowed).
  - Repeat 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 … indefinitely.
- This trace obeys every ""after X, one of {...} must happen"" constraint, never produces event6 or event1. Because event3 does happen in this trace but event6 never does, C1 (""if event3 then event6"") is false in that model. Also event1 never happens, so the conjunction in C2 is false.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event6 happens"" — i.e., in the next state both event4 and event6 occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules from the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be one of {event4, event5, event7}.

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- From event1, event4 is one possible next event, but so are event5 and event7. Thus C1 is possible but not guaranteed (not entailed).
- Event6 is not listed as a possible immediate successor of event1, so event6 cannot occur in that same next state. Event6 could occur after a subsequent step (for example after event4 you can get event6), but that would be the state after the next one, not the next state itself.

Conclusion
- C2 asserts that both event4 and event6 happen in the next state. That cannot be established from the rules (event6 is not an immediate successor of event1, and only one event occurs in the next state). Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened. From ""after event1, either event4, event5, or event7 must happen,"" event4 is only one of three possible next events — so C1 (event4 happens next) is possible but not guaranteed.
- Even if event4 does happen next, the rule ""after event4, either event1, event3, or event6 must happen"" makes event6 only one possible subsequent event, not certain.
- Therefore C2 (both: event4 happens next AND event6 happens) is not entailed. A concrete counterexample: from event1 → event4 (next), then choose event1 afterward (not event6). That satisfies the given rules but falsifies C2.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" C2: ""C1 holds and event6 happens.""
- From the context: initially event1 happened. The rule ""After event1, either event4, event5, or event7 must happen"" means the next state after the initial event1 can be 4, 5, or 7.
- Therefore event4 in the next state (C1) is possible but not guaranteed (the next state could be event5 or event7 instead).
- Also, event6 cannot occur immediately after event1 (6 is not one of the allowed immediate successors of event1). Event6 could occur later if the sequence goes 1 -> 4 -> 6, but that is only one possible path, not forced.
- Because C1 is not guaranteed and event6 is not guaranteed, the conjunction C2 is not entailed by the given information.

Thus C2 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 = C1 or event5, and C1 = (event5 and event3). So C2 is equivalent to event5 (since (event5 and event3) OR event5 = event5).
- We ask: must event5 happen on every possible sequence starting from the initial event6?
- From event6 you can choose event7, and from event7 choose event3, and from event3 choose event6, returning to event6. Repeating this (6 → 7 → 3 → 6 → ...) yields an infinite execution that never visits event5.
- Therefore event5 does not necessarily occur, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---

---
C2 is equivalent to ""event5 happens"" (since (event5 AND event3) OR event5 simplifies to event5).

Is event5 guaranteed? No — there is a valid sequence that avoids event5 forever. Example:
6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 6 -> ... ,
using the allowed choices 6→7, 7→3, 3→6 repeatedly. This cycle never reaches event5.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- We start with event4 in the current state.
- The rule after event4 says: either event2 or event6 must happen in the next state. So the immediate next state can be event2 or event6, but not both.
- C1 requires that event7 and event2 both happen in the same state. There is no rule allowing both event7 and event2 to occur simultaneously immediately after event4.
- Although event7 can occur after event6 (in the state after the next), that would be two steps away. C2 requires C1 to hold in the next state (one step), which is impossible given the transitions.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
We start at the initial state where event4 happened. The rules say: after event4, the next event must be either event2 or event6. So the immediate next state can be:
- event2, or
- event6.

C1 asserts ""Event7 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., both event7 and event2 occur in that same next state). No single state can be both event2 and event7 simultaneously, and from event4 the next state cannot be event7 at all (only event2 or event6 are allowed). Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state.

So C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is False.
---
Step 1 — understand the claim:
- C1: ""Event7 happens and event2 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate next state after the initial state, both event7 and event2 occur.

Step 2 — use the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, the next event must be either event2 or event6 (exclusive choice from the rule).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state:
- If the next state is event2, event7 does not also happen in that same next state.
- If the next state is event6, neither event2 nor event7 both happen there.
- The rules use ""either ... or ..."" so you cannot have both event2 and event7 occur simultaneously in the next state.

Conclusion: C1 cannot hold in the immediate next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether ""Event4 does not happen"" always holds (C2).

Start: event7 happened.

Rules used:
- After event7, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event1 or event6 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event3, either event2, event4, or event7 must happen.

Construct a valid sequence that leads to event4:
7 → 2 (allowed by after 7)  
2 → 5 (after 2 must be 5)  
5 → 1 (choose 1 from after 5)  
1 → 3 (choose 3 from after 1)  
3 → 4 (choose 4 from after 3)

All choices respect the given conditions, and this sequence produces event4. Therefore event4 can happen in some allowed execution, so ""Event4 does not happen"" does not always hold.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2 says C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible sequence, event4 never occurs).
- From the rules: 7 -> {2,3} and 3 -> {2,4,7}.
- Starting at the initial event7, choose the allowed transitions 7 → 3 and then 3 → 4. This yields a valid sequence in which event4 occurs.
- Because there exists at least one valid sequence where event4 happens, C1 is not always true, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. in every possible sequence starting from the initial condition, event4 never happens.

Step 2 — examine the rules and trace a possible sequence:
- Initially event7 happens.
- From event7 the rules allow event3 (since after event7 either event2 or event3 must happen).
- From event3 the rules allow event4 (since after event3 either event2, event4, or event7 must happen).

So there is a valid sequence: 7 → 3 → 4, in which event4 does happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happened.
- The rules say: after event6, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- C1 asserts event6 happens in the next state — that contradicts the rule (6 → {1,2,5}), so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts event1 happens and C1 holds (i.e., both event1 and event6 occur in the next state). Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true.
---
We start in event6. The rules say: ""After event6, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen."" Event6 is not among those choices, so event6 cannot occur in the next state. Therefore C1 (""Event6 happens in the next state"") is false. C2 requires both ""Event1 happens"" and C1; since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We interpret ""next state"" as the immediate event following the initial event6.

- From the rules: after event6 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5}. Event6 is not allowed as the immediate next event.
- Therefore C1 (""Event6 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 requires both ""Event1 happens"" and C1. Even though event1 could happen next, C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event5 happens and event7 happens"".
- From the conditions: initially event4 happens. After event4, event2 must happen. After event2, one of {event1, event3, event5, event6} must happen. After event1, one of {event2, event4} must happen.
- Starting from the initial event4 we get event2. From event2 we can choose event1. From event1 we can choose event2 again. Thus we can produce an infinite loop: 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
- This infinite run never includes event5 or event7, so C1 (""event5 and event7 happen"") need not ever hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed and is False.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So sequence begins: 4 -> 2.
- After event2, one allowed next event is event5. Choose that: 4 -> 2 -> 5.
- After event5, one allowed next event is event7. Choose that: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7.

Thus there exists an execution in which both event5 and event7 occur, so ""C1: Event5 happens and event7 happens"" eventually holds. Therefore C2 is True.
---
We interpret C2 as the claim that ""eventually both event5 and event7 will occur"" from the given initial condition and transition rules (i.e. that this eventuality must hold on all possible runs). Step-by-step:

- Transitions (from the statements): 4 -> 2; 2 -> {1,3,5,6}; 1 -> {2,4}; 3 -> {2,5}; 5 -> {2,6,7}; 6 -> 4; 7 -> {1,2}.
- Initially we have event4, so the next event must be event2 (4 -> 2).
- From event2 we may choose event1. From event1 we may go to event4, and from event4 to event2 again. So there is a cycle 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 ... that never produces event5 or event7.
- Because such a run avoids events 5 and 7 forever, the statement ""eventually both event5 and event7 happen"" is not guaranteed on all runs.
- (As a note: there are runs where C1 does occur, e.g. 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7, so C1 is satisfiable, but not inevitable.)

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event5 happened. From the rules: after event5, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen next. So event2 is a possible next event.
- C1 says: ""If event2 happens, then event7 happens."" Interpreting that as ""after event2, event7 must happen.""
- But the given rules state: after event2, event5 must happen. That directly contradicts C1 — after event2 is event5, not event7.
- Because there is a possible next-state trace where event2 occurs and event7 does not follow, C1 does not hold in the next state.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret C1:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event7 happens"" means whenever event2 occurs, the immediate next event must be event7.

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context explicitly states: ""After event2, event5 must happen."" That directly contradicts C1 (after event2 the next event is event5, not event7).

Step 3 — interpret C2:
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means that in the immediate successors of the initial state, C1 should be true. But one immediate successor of the initial state (initially event5) is the state reached when event2 happens (after event5, event2 is allowed). In that successor, C1 is false because after event2 the next event must be event5 (per the context).

Conclusion:
- Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is the claim ""If event2 happens, then event7 happens"" (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event7 must occur).
- Initially event5 happened. From event5 the next event may be event1, event2, or event4.
- To test C1 in the next state, consider the concrete continuation where the next event is event2 (this is allowed).
- After event2, the rules force event5. From event5 choose event1 (allowed). From event1 choose event3 (allowed). From event3 choose event2 (allowed). This yields the cycle: ... -> event2 -> event5 -> event1 -> event3 -> event2 -> ...
- This cycle never forces event7, so there is a valid execution in the next state where event2 occurs but event7 never occurs. That is a counterexample to C1 holding in the next state.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

False

Reasoning: Initially event7 happened. The rule ""After event7, either event1, or event6 must happen"" means the next state could have event6. C1 asserts ""event6 does not happen""; C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Because the next state might be the one where event6 happens, C1 need not hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (False).
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The rule ""After event7, either event1, or event6 must happen"" means the next state can be event1 or event6.
- C2 asserts that in the next state event6 does not happen (i.e., event1 must occur).
- But nothing in the rules forces event1 instead of event6; event6 is a permitted next event.
- Therefore C1 need not hold in the next state, so C2 is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False.
---
We start from the fact that initially event7 happened. The rule ""After event7, either event1, or event6 must happen"" therefore forces the next state to contain either event1 or event6. C1 asserts ""Event6 does not happen"" in that next state. But the rule allows event6 to happen (it's one of the required alternatives), so C1 is not guaranteed; there is a valid next-state choice where event6 does occur. Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We can refute C1 by exhibiting a valid sequence that never contains event6.

From the rules:
- Start at event5.
- 5 -> 4 is allowed.
- 4 -> 1 is forced.
- 1 -> 2 is allowed.
- 2 -> 5 is allowed.

Thus the infinite cycle 5 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 5 → ... is permitted and never includes event6. Therefore C1 (""Event6 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 is ""Event6 always happens."" So C2 asserts that event6 inevitably occurs on every possible execution starting from the initial state.

Relevant transitions (condensed):
- Initially: event5.
- 5 → {1, 4, 7}
- 4 → 1
- 1 → {2, 3, 4, 6}
- 2 → {3, 5, 7}
- 3 → {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- 6 → {2, 4}
- 7 → {2, 4, 5}

To show C1 is false it suffices to exhibit one valid infinite execution that never visits event6. Starting at the initial event5, consider this cycle of choices:
- 5 → 4 (allowed)
- 4 → 1 (forced)
- 1 → 2 (choose 2 to avoid 6)
- 2 → 5 (choose 5)
Now we are back at event5 and can repeat the same choices indefinitely: 5→4→1→2→5→4→1→2→5→...
This infinite run never contains event6, so event6 does not always happen. Therefore C1 is false, and C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Start at event5. From 5 you may choose event4.
- From 4 you must go to event1.
- From 1 you may choose event4 (choice set {2,3,4,6}), avoiding 6.
- This yields a loop 5 → 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → ... that never visits event6.
Thus event6 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible execution, so ""Event6 always happens"" (C1) is false, and therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — parse the hypothesis
- C1 is ""event7 happens or event7 happens"", i.e. simply: event7 happens.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event5 happens"", i.e. event7 happens AND event5 happens.

Step 2 — inspect the rules and start state
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event6, event7}.
- There is a rule describing what can happen after event5, but there is no rule that ever produces event5 from any other event.
- No rule in the context leads to event5 starting from the initial event4 (or from any other event listed).

Step 3 — conclusion
- Event5 cannot occur in any sequence that starts from the given initial state, so the conjunction ""event7 and event5"" cannot be true.
- Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event7 happens or event7 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event7 happens"".
- Starting from the initial event4, one allowed next event is event7 (event4 -> event7). So C1 can be satisfied.
- C2 requires both C1 and event5 to happen, i.e. event7 and event5.
- No rule in the context allows any event to lead to event5 (the only rule mentioning event5 is what succeeds event5, not what leads to it). Since event5 is not reachable from the initial event4, event5 cannot occur.
- Therefore C2 (which requires event5) cannot be satisfied.

Conclusion: False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event7 happens or event7 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""Event7 happens"".
- C2 requires both C1 and ""Event5 happens"", so it requires both Event7 and Event5 to occur.
- From the context: initially Event4 happened. The rule ""After event4, either event1, event3, event6, or event7 must happen"" allows Event7 as one possible next event, but it does not force Event7 (other alternatives are allowed).
- There is no rule forcing Event5 to ever happen (there are rules that describe what happens after Event5, but nothing that requires Event5 to occur).
- Therefore we cannot conclude that both Event7 and Event5 must happen. C2 is not entailed by the given information.

Sample responses:
Analysis:
- Initial state: event1 happened.
- From the rules: after event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7}. event1 is not allowed next, so C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 is ""Event7 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is false, C2 would be true only if event7 must happen next.
- But the rule only says one of {2,3,4,5,6,7} must happen; event7 is allowed but not required. There is no rule forcing event7 to occur next.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Initial fact: event1 happens now.
- From the rule ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, or event7 must happen,"" the next state must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7}.
- C1 claims event1 happens in the next state. But event1 is not among the allowed next events, so C1 is false.
- C2 is ""event7 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 would require that event7 must happen in the next state. The rules only allow event7 as one possible next event, not as the guaranteed one (the next state could be any of the listed events). Therefore we cannot conclude event7 necessarily happens.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step-by-step:

1. Initially event1 happened. The relevant rule is: ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, or event7 must happen.""  
2. C1 asserts ""Event1 happens in the next state."" But event1 is not in the list of allowed events after event1, so C1 is false (event1 cannot be the immediate next event).  
3. C2 asserts ""Event7 happens or C1 holds."" After event1, event7 is one of the possible next events, but it is not guaranteed to happen (the rule allows several alternatives). Since C1 is false and event7 is not forced, we cannot conclude C2 must be true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in all states / at all times).

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transitions
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule for after event1: the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event6, event7}. Event1 is not among these options.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- From the initial state (event1), the immediate next state cannot be event1, so C1 is false.
- Since C1 is already false in the initial transition, C1 cannot ""always hold."" Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Hypotheses: C1 says ""Event1 happens in the next state."" C2 says ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible next state, event1 occurs).
2. From the context, initially event1 happened. The rule ""After event1, either event3, event4, event6, or event7 must happen"" lists the possible next events after the initial event1.
3. None of those allowed next events is event1. For example, choose event3 as the next event. Then in that next state event1 does not happen, so C1 is false in that state.
4. Because there exists a reachable next state (e.g., after initial event1 → event3) where C1 fails, C1 is not always true. Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts that event1 occurs in the next state.
- The initial state has event1. The rule ""After event1, either event3, event4, event6, or event7 must happen"" applies, so the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event6, event7}.
- event1 is not among the allowed next events, so C1 is false in the next state.
- Since C1 is not even true for the immediate next state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7, the next state must be one of {event1, event4, event5}.

Step 3 — reason about possibilities:
- From the rule after event7, event1 is explicitly allowed as the next event. So C1 (event1 in the next state) is possible.
- C2 asserts that event1 does not happen in the next state. Since event1 is allowed, we cannot conclude that event1 definitely does not happen.

Conclusion:
- C2 is not supported by the given information; it is false to assert that C1 does not hold.

Final answer: False
---
We are given that initially event7 happened. The relevant rule: ""After event7, either event1, event4, or event5 must happen."" That means in the next state one of {event1, event4, event5} will occur — event1 is a possible next event.

C1 asserts: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That is possible but not guaranteed (it is one of the allowed options).

C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does not happen next). Because event1 is allowed to occur next, C1 is not ruled out, so C2 is not true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event7 happened. The rule ""After event7, either event1, event4, or event5 must happen"" means the next state could be event1, but it could also be event4 or event5. C1 asserts event1 happens in the next state — that is possible but not guaranteed. C2 asserts C1 does not hold (i.e., event1 definitely does not happen), which is not supported by the given rules.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""Event3 happens and Event4 does not happen"") follows from the given rules, starting with event2.

From event2 the next event may be 4, 5, 6, or 7. Therefore event4 can occur (there is an allowed run where event4 happens). That alone shows C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is not guaranteed. Since C2 requires C1, C2 is not guaranteed either.

Thus the hypothesis C2 is False.
---

---
We want to know whether C2 (""Event3 happens and Event4 does not happen"") can be true given the rules.

Step 1 — identify rules (condensed):
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2: one of {4,5,6,7}.
- After event4: one of {1,2,3,5,7}.
- After event5: one of {1,2,3,4,6}.
- After event6: event3.
- After event7: one of {2,3,4,5,6}.
- After event1: event6.
- After event3: one of {1,2,7}.

Step 2 — look for any rule that forces event4 at some point:
- Several transitions allow event4 as an option, but none require event4 unavoidably. All ""must happen"" clauses give multiple alternatives in which a non-4 choice exists (except when event4 itself occurs, but that would be a choice, not forced).

Step 3 — produce a valid sequence that makes C2 true:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Choose after event2 → event6 (allowed).
- After event6 → event3 (forced).
Thus event3 occurs, and we never had to choose event4. From event3 we can continue (for example event1 → event6 → event3 ...) without ever choosing event4.

Conclusion: It is possible to have event3 happen while event4 never happens, so C2 can be true.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event1 does not eventually happen)

Step 2 — use the facts:

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial state where event2 already happened, C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This requires that in every possible immediate successor state after the initial event2, event2 will eventually occur.

From the rules, after event2 the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4}. To make C2 true, each of those next states would have to guarantee that event2 happens at some future time.

But there are counterexamples that avoid event2 forever:
- If the next state is event1, one can follow event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> ... indefinitely. This cycle never reaches event2.
- If the next state is event3, one can take 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... and again avoid event2 indefinitely.
- If the next state is event4, one can pick 4 -> 1 and then loop 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... to avoid event2.

Because there exist successor choices from the next state that never lead back to event2, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (stepwise):
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in every possible immediate successor state, event2 occurs at some future point.

From the initial event2, the immediate successors are event1, event3, or event4.

- If next = event1: 1 → 6 → 2 (or 1 → 3 → 5 → 2). Thus event2 is reachable.
- If next = event3: 3 → 5 → 2 (or 3 → 1 → 6 → 2). Thus event2 is reachable.
- If next = event4: 4 → 2 immediately. Thus event2 is reachable.

Since in every possible next state there exists a future where event2 occurs, C1 holds in the next state. Therefore C2 is True.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the state immediately after the initial one, event2 is guaranteed to occur eventually.
- Initially event2 happened. From that state the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- If the next event is event1, the rules allow event1 → event3 and event3 → event1, so the system can cycle 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 … forever and never return to event2.
- Because such a valid future exists from the next state that avoids event2 indefinitely, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened. C1 asserts ""event4 or event1 happens"" at the current step; that is false at the initial step because event7 is neither event4 nor event1.
- Since C1 fails at the initial state, it cannot ""always hold."" (Moreover, from event7 the next events can be event2 or event3, also neither 1 nor 4, so subsequent steps can fail C1 as well.)

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Transitions (deduplicated): 7 -> {2,3}; 2 -> {3,4,5,6}; 3 -> {1,6}; 4 -> {2,3,5,6}; 5 -> {2,4,7}; 6 -> {1,5}; 1 -> {3,4,6}.
- Start at event7. There exists a cycle that never visits 1 or 4: 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2 -> ...
  - 7 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 3 (allowed), 3 -> 6 (allowed), 6 -> 5 (allowed), 5 -> 2 (allowed), and the cycle repeats.
- This infinite path avoids both event1 and event4 forever, so the property ""event4 happens or event1 happens"" does not hold on all possible executions.
Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 is the statement ""Event4 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 says C1 always holds (i.e., on every possible execution starting from the initial event).

Counterexample from the given transitions:
- Initial event is 7. From 7 we may go to 3 (7 -> 3).
- From 3 we can go to 6 (3 -> 6).
- From 6 we can go to 5 (6 -> 5).
- From 5 we can go to 2 (5 -> 2).
- From 2 we can go to 3 (2 -> 3).

Thus we have an infinite cycle avoiding events 1 and 4:
7, 3, 6, 5, 2, 3, 6, 5, 2, 3, ...

This shows there exists an execution in which neither event1 nor event4 ever happens, so C1 does not always hold. (Also note the initial event7 itself is neither 1 nor 4, so C1 is not true at the start.) Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
We start from the initial condition: event3 happened.

From the context: ""After event3, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen."" So the next event is one of {event1, event4, event6, event7}.

C1 is ""event1 happens or event6 happens."" C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state — i.e., that the next event is event1 or event6.

But since event4 or event7 are allowed after event3, the next event could be event4 (or event7), which would make C1 false in that next state. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed in the next state, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Initial event: event3.

From the rules: ""After event3, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen."" Thus the next event could be event4 or event7 as well as event1 or event6.

C1 is ""event1 happens or event6 happens."" That is not guaranteed in the next state because event4 or event7 are allowed alternatives.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False. 

Final answer: False

False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule for event3 says: after event3, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen.
- C1 is ""event1 or event6."" That holds for some of these next events (event1 or event6) but not for others (event4 or event7).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event6 does not happen (i.e., 6 never occurs).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event6 does happen).

So C2 is true exactly when event6 must occur. We must check whether event6 is unavoidable given the rules.

Step 2 — examine transitions and trace a sequence avoiding event6
- Start: event5.
- From event5 we may choose event4 (allowed: after 5 → {4,6}). Choosing 4 avoids 6.
- From event4 choose event1 (after 4 → {1,3,6,7}). Choosing 1 avoids 6.
- From event1 choose event2 (after 1 → {2,3,4,6}). Choosing 2 avoids 6.
- From event2 choose event1 (after 2 → {1,4,7}). That returns to event1.

Now we have a loop 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 … that never uses event6. Thus there exists a valid infinite sequence starting from the initial event5 that never hits event6.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence that avoids event6, event6 is not forced to happen. Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ ""Event6 does happen.""

So we must decide whether event6 necessarily happens given the rules.

Step 2 — examine transitions (ignore duplicate lines)
- Start: 5
- After 5 → {4, 6}
- After 4 → {1, 3, 6, 7}
- After 1 → {2, 3, 4, 6}
- After 2 → {1, 4, 7}
- After 3 → {4, 5, 6}
- After 7 → {3, 4, 5}
- After 6 → {1, 2, 3, 4}

Step 3 — find a sequence that avoids event6
- From the start: 5 → 4 (allowed).
- From 4 → 1 (allowed).
- From 1 → 2 (allowed).
- From 2 → 1 (allowed).
Thus we can loop 1 ↔ 2 forever: 5, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
This infinite sequence never visits event6 and respects every ""after X"" constraint.

Conclusion
- It is possible for event6 to never happen, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"" / ""event6 happens"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. Event6 does happen)

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event5 happened.
- From event5 the next event must be either event4 or event6.
- There are transitions 4 -> {1,3,6,7}; 1 -> {2,3,4,6}; 2 -> {1,4,7}; etc.

Step 3 — show a valid sequence that avoids event6:
- From the initial event5 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
Now we can cycle 1 -> 2 -> 1 indefinitely. None of these steps requires event6, so it is possible that event6 never happens.

Conclusion:
Because there exists a valid sequence where event6 never occurs, C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the claim
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event6 happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, eventually event3 or event6 must occur)

Step 2 — Understand the rules (as transitions)
- 1 → {5,7}
- 2 → {1,3,5,6,7}
- 3 → {1,4,5,6}
- 4 → {1,2,3,7}
- 5 → {1,2,4,7}
- 6 → {1,2,5,7}
- 7 → {1,2,3,4,5}
- Initially: event1 happened.

Step 3 — Look for a counterexample (a possible execution where event1 occurs but neither 3 nor 6 ever occurs)
- From 1 we may choose 5 (allowed).
- From 5 we may choose 1 (allowed).
- Repeat: 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... ad infinitum.
This infinite execution never visits event3 or event6, so C1 is false along this execution despite event1 having occurred.

Step 4 — Conclusion
Because there exists a valid execution starting from event1 in which neither event3 nor event6 ever happens, the implication ""if event1 happens then (event3 or event6 happens)"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
C1: event3 or event6 happens.
C2: if event1 happens then (event3 or event6) happens.

From the context, initially event1 happens. After event1, the next event must be either event5 or event7. After event5, the next event can be event1 (allowed). So one valid infinite sequence consistent with the rules is:

event1 (initial) → event5 → event1 → event5 → event1 → ...

This sequence never includes event3 or event6, yet it respects all given ""after eventX ..."" constraints. Therefore there exists a model where event1 occurs but C1 is false, so the implication C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context, after event1 the only allowed next events are event5 or event7 (""After event1, either event5, or event7 must happen"").
2. From event5 the allowed next events include event1 (""After event5, either event1, event2, event4, or event7 must happen"").
3. Therefore there is a valid sequence 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... that never produces event3 or event6.
4. C1 asserts that event3 or event6 happens; C2 asserts that whenever event1 happens, C1 holds. The existence of the infinite 1-5 loop shows that event1 can occur without ever reaching event3 or event6.
5. Thus C2 is not guaranteed by the given constraints.

Sample responses:
We interpret C1 as ""Event5 holds in the next state"" (X Event5) and C2 as ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X X Event5), i.e. Event5 happens two steps from now.

Start: event7 happened.
- From event7, the next state must be event4.
- From event4, the next state must be event3.
- From event3, the following state must be either event1 or event5.

So event5 can occur three steps from the start (after 7 → 4 → 3 → 5), not one or two steps from the start. Therefore C1 is false at the start, and C2 (which requires Event5 two steps ahead) is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happens.
- After event7, event4 must happen → the next state (state1) is event4.
- C2 says that in that next state (state1) the statement C1 holds; C1 says “event5 happens in the next state (relative to state1)”, i.e. event5 would have to occur in state2.
- But after event4, event3 must happen, so state2 is event3, not event5.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happens, and after event7 event4 must happen next. So the immediate next state is event4.
- After event4, event3 must happen in the following state. So timeline is: t0: event7 -> t1: event4 -> t2: event3 -> t3: either event1 or event5.
- C1 asserts ""event5 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at t1). But t1 is event4, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at t1, C1 is true, meaning event5 would occur at t2). But t2 is event3, so C1 is not true at t1. Therefore C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""Event6 happens and Event2 does not happen"") follows from the given context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initial fact: event5 happened.
- From event5, the allowed next events include event2 (the context explicitly states: after event5, either event1, event2, event4, event6, or event7 must happen).
- Therefore event2 is possible; the context does not rule out event2 happening.
- C1 (event2 does not happen) is not guaranteed by the context.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold (and also that event6 happens), and C1 is not ensured, C2 is not entailed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Summary: From the given rules, the initial event is event5, and from event5 the next event may be event1, event2, event4, event6, or event7. No rule forbids event2, nor does any rule force event6 to occur. Therefore ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is not entailed, and so ""Event6 happens and Event2 does not happen"" (C2) is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: Event2 does not happen (i.e., no occurrence of event2 anywhere).
- C2: Event6 happens and C1 holds (so event6 occurs at least once and event2 never occurs).

Step 2 — relevant transitions (condensed)
- Initially: event5.
- From 5 → {1,2,4,6,7}
- From 6 → {2,3,4,5}
- From 3 → {1,4,5,6}
- (Other transitions contain no new constraints for this question.)

Step 3 — can C2 be satisfied?
- From the initial event5 we may choose next = event6 (5 → 6 is allowed), so event6 can occur.
- After 6 we can choose 3 (6 → 3 allowed). From 3 we can choose 6 (3 → 6 allowed). Thus the cycle 6 → 3 → 6 … is allowed.
- This gives a valid sequence starting from the initial 5: 5, 6, 3, 6, 3, ... This sequence contains event6 and contains no event2 at any step.

Conclusion
- It is possible to satisfy ""event6 happens and event2 never happens"" given the rules, so C2 can be true.

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible run/state, C1 is true).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions / initial situation:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So there is an execution consisting only of event2 and then termination.

Step 3 — Trace and reason:
- In that execution only event2 occurs; neither event3 nor event4 ever happens.
- Therefore C1 is false in that execution.
- Since C2 asserts that C1 holds in all executions/states, and we have a counterexample execution where C1 is false, C2 does not hold.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event4 happens"" (i.e., at a given point in the execution either event3 or event4 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — meaning at every point in the behavior/execution, either event3 or event4 occurs.

2. Examine the given conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- Crucially: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means the execution stops after the initial event2; there are no subsequent events at all.

3. Trace the sequence
- The only event that actually occurs is event2. Events 3 and 4 never occur in this execution.

4. Conclusion
- At the initial (and only) point where event2 happened, neither event3 nor event4 happens, so C1 is false there.
- Therefore C1 does not hold always, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in all executions/at all times C1 is true).

Step 2 — inspect the initial condition and transitions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — check C1 and C2
- In the actual initial/only execution, only event2 occurs and neither event3 nor event4 occurs. Thus C1 is false in that execution.
- Since C1 is not true in the initial (and only) execution, C1 does not ""always hold."" Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We must check whether in every possible sequence starting from event6, eventually C2 holds (i.e., either C1 holds — event1 or event3 occurs — or event2 occurs).

From the initial event6 the allowed next events are: 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7. Consider each:

- If next is event1 → C1 holds (event1), so C2 holds.
- If next is event2 → event2 holds, so C2 holds.
- If next is event4 → after event4, event3 must happen → event3 occurs, so C1 holds, so C2 holds.
- If next is event5 → after event5 the choices are 1, 2, or 7:
  - If 1 or 2 occurs then C2 holds immediately (1 gives C1; 2 gives event2).
  - If 7 occurs, then after 7 the choices are 1 or 2, so again 1 or 2 will occur and C2 holds.
- If next is event7 → after event7 the choices are 1 or 2, so 1 or 2 will occur and C2 holds.

Every possible branch from the initial event6 leads to either event1, event3, or event2 within one or two steps. Therefore C2 is guaranteed true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — restate hypothesis
- C1 = (event3 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event2 happens) = (event1 OR event3) OR event2 = (event1 OR event2 OR event3).

Step 2 — look at possible immediate successors of the initial event6
- Initially event6 happened.
- After event6 one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event7} must happen.

Step 3 — examine each case
- If event1 happens: C2 holds (event1).
- If event2 happens: C2 holds (event2).
- If event4 happens: after event4, event3 must happen → C2 holds (event3).
- If event5 happens: after event5 one of {event1, event2, event7} must happen.
  - If that next is event1 or event2, C2 holds.
  - If that next is event7, after event7 one of {event1, event2} must happen, so eventually event1 or event2 occurs → C2 holds.
- If event7 happens: after event7 one of {event1, event2} must happen → C2 holds.

Step 4 — conclude
Every possible branch starting from the initial event6 leads to at least one of event1, event2, or event3 occurring. Therefore C2 is necessarily true.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C2 holds given the rules and the fact that event6 happens initially. C2 is (C1) or event2, and C1 is event3 or event1. So C2 is equivalent to (event1 or event2 or event3).

Start at event6. The allowed immediate successors from event6 are {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}. Check each case:

- If 1 occurs, C2 holds (event1).
- If 2 occurs, C2 holds (event2).
- If 4 occurs, the rule says after 4 event3 must happen, so event3 occurs and C2 holds.
- If 5 occurs, the rule says after 5 either 1, 2, or 7 must happen. If 1 or 2 happens, C2 holds immediately. If 7 happens, then after 7 either 1 or 2 must happen, so eventually 1 or 2 occurs and C2 holds.
- If 7 occurs (directly from 6), then after 7 either 1 or 2 must happen, so C2 holds.

Every possible branch from the initial event6 leads to event1, event2, or event3. Therefore C2 is guaranteed true.

Final answer: True"
