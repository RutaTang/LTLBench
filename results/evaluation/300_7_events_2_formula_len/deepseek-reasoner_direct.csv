For example, starting from event5, one can go to event3, then to event5, and continue cycling between event3 and event5 indefinitely without event1 occurring. Similarly, other paths involving events2, event4, event6, and event7 can avoid event1. Therefore, event1 does not always happen, meaning C1 is false. Since C2 states that ""C1 does not hold,"" and C1 is false, C2 is true.

The rules allow for a sequence where event4 happens initially, followed by event5, then event6, and then event3. This sequence satisfies both C1 (event4 and event6 happen) and event3 happens, so C2 holds. Other sequences from event4 can also lead to event3 and event6 occurring, confirming that C2 is possible.
