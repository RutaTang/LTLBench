Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts event7 occurs next.
- The rules include: after event7, event6 must happen.
- After event6, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event7 may happen (it's a nondeterministic choice).
- Thus starting from event7 we get 7 → 6 → 1 → (2 or 7). The transition to event2 is not forced; the system could choose event7 again and loop indefinitely.
Therefore C2 (""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is not guaranteed, so it is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"We must decide whether C2 (""Event7 happens or Event6 does not happen"") is guaranteed by the given transition rules starting from the initial event5.

1) What the hypothesis asks
- C2 is true iff in every allowed sequence starting from the initial event5 either (a) event7 occurs at some point, or (b) event6 never occurs. C2 would be false if there exists at least one allowed sequence in which event6 occurs and event7 never occurs.

2) Relevant transitions (condensed)
- start: event5
- 5 -> {2, 3, 7}
- 2 -> {3, 4, 5, 6}
- 6 -> {1, 2, 7}
- 1 -> {2, 3, 5}
- 3 -> {4, 5}
- 4 -> {1, 2, 3, 7}
- 7 -> {2, 3}

Importantly, each of these transitions always includes at least one successor that is not 7.

3) Construct a counterexample sequence
- From the initial event5 choose 5 -> 2 (avoiding 7).
- From 2 choose 2 -> 6 (so event6 happens).
- From 6 choose 6 -> 2 (avoiding 7).
- Now repeat 2 -> 6 -> 2 indefinitely.

This infinite sequence contains event6 and never visits event7. Thus there exists an allowed sequence where event6 occurs and event7 never occurs.

4) Conclusion
- Because such a sequence exists, C2 (""event7 happens or event6 does not happen"") is not guaranteed by the rules. Therefore C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""Event7 does not happen"". C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", i.e. ""Event2 happens or Event7 does not happen"".
- Start: event4 happened. From event4 we may choose event7 (rule: after 4 either 6 or 7).
- From event7 we may choose event6 (rule: after 7 either 2, 3, or 6).
- From event6 we may choose event7 (rule: after 6 either 1, 3, 4, 5, or 7).
- This gives a valid sequence 4 → 7 → 6 → 7 → 6 → ... that repeats forever, in which event7 does happen (so C1 is false) and event2 never occurs.
- Thus there exists a consistent event sequence where neither event2 occurs nor event7 is absent, making C2 false (it is not guaranteed).

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., event2 occurs in every possible run)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when there is at least one valid sequence (consistent with the rules and start) in which event2 does not always happen.

Step 2 — examine the rules and start
- Start: event4 happened.
- Relevant transitions:
  - after event4 → {event1, event2, event3}
  - after event1 → {event3, event5, event6}
  - after event6 → {event3, event4, event7}
  - other rules exist but we only need to show one valid path avoiding event2.

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence that avoids event2
- From start: event4 → choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 → choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 → choose event4 (allowed).
- This makes a loop: 4 → 1 → 6 → 4 → 1 → 6 → ...
- None of the events in this infinite sequence is event2, so event2 does not always happen.

Conclusion
- Because a valid sequence exists in which event2 never occurs, C1 is false, so C2 is true.

- Initially, event4 happened. So C1 is false in the initial state, but C2 is about the next state.

Step 3 — examine transition rules relevant to event4:
- The rule ""After event4, either event1, or event7 must happen"" (stated multiple times) governs what can occur immediately after event4.
- No rule allows event4 to occur immediately after event4.

Step 4 — conclude:

Interpretation: C1 means event6 is inevitable — every possible future sequence of events (starting from the initial event3) must include event6. C2 is the negation: there is some allowed infinite sequence starting from event3 that never has event6.

Check the transitions (merged and simplified):
- from 3 → {1,2,5,7}
- from 5 → {1,2,3,7}
- from 1 → {4,5}
- from 2 → {1,5,6}
- from 7 → {3,5,6}
- from 4 → {3,6}
- from 6 → {1,2,3,4,5}

Look for a path from the initial event3 that avoids event6 forever. One valid cycle is:
3 → 1 → 5 → 3 → 1 → 5 → ... 
Each step is allowed by the rules (3→1, 1→5, 5→3), and no step uses event6. This gives an infinite sequence that never contains event6.

Therefore event6 is not inevitable (C1 is false), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually the statement ""event3 eventually happens"" is true).

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event7 happened.
- One rule says: after event7, event3 must happen. (So 7 → 3.)
- Other rules create cycles but are unnecessary once we know 3 will occur.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event7 happened initially and 7 → 3, event3 will occur eventually. Thus C1 is true right away.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds. Since C1 already holds (event3 will happen), C2 is also true.

Relevant transition rules (extracted):
- Initially: event4.
- 4 -> {2, 3, 6}
- 2 -> {1, 4, 6, 7}
- 3 -> {4, 6, 7}
- 6 -> {7}
- 1 -> {2, 4, 7}
- 7 -> {1, 2, 4}

Counterexample trace:
- Start at initial event4.
- From 4 choose 6 (allowed).
- From 6 must go to 7.
- From 7 we can choose 1 (allowed by 7 -> {1,2,4}) — this is not event3.

Thus there is a reachable situation where event7 occurs and the next state is event1 (not event3). Therefore the implication ""if event7 happens then event3 happens next"" is not guaranteed.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C2 asserts that whenever C1 (event6 happens next) holds, event1 will occur.
- From the rules: after event6 one possible next event is event3 (event6 -> event2 or event3 or event4).
- From event3 we can go to event2 (3 -> 2), and from event2 back to event3 (2 -> 3) — so there is a valid cycle 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 ... that never produces event1.
- Thus even if event6 happens, it is possible to continue in a way that never leads to event1. That is a counterexample to the implication, so C2 is False."

- “After event3, no other events can happen.” This means the execution ends immediately after the initial event3; no further events (including event2 or event4) can occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- Because no events can occur after the initial event3, event4 cannot eventually happen. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication “if event2 happens then event4 eventually happens.”
- Event2 cannot happen in any allowed execution (no events occur after event3), so the antecedent is impossible. An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" (i.e., C1 ∨ event5)

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- The implication p → p is a logical tautology (always true regardless of whether p is true or false). So C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is C1 ∨ event5. Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event5.

- From event2 we can go to event5.
- From event5 we can go to event7.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- We start at event6.
- From event6 we may choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 we may choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 we must go to event3.
- From event3 we may choose event5.
- From event5 we may choose event6.
- From event6 choose event3 again, and repeat.

That yields an infinite cycle: 6 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 → 3 → 2 → ... In this cycle event2 occurs repeatedly, but event4 never occurs (we always avoid the transitions 6→1 or 6→7 and the choices 1→4 or 7→4).

C1 (""If event2 happens, then event4 happens"") is falsified by this run because event2 occurs without any later event4. Therefore C1 does not eventually hold, so C2 is False."

- C1: Event6 always happens (i.e., in every possible future from the initial state, event6 eventually occurs).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., it is not true that event6 always happens).
Question: Is C2 True or False?

Step 2 — examine the transitions (condensed):
- Start: event2.
- 2 → {1, 3}
- 1 → {2, 7}
- 3 → {1}
- 7 → {2, 4, 5, 6}
- 6 → {1, 4, 7}
- 5 → {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- 4 → {2, 5, 6}

Step 3 — find a path that avoids event6 forever (if one exists, C1 is false and C2 true):
From the start (2) take 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 and repeat:
- 2 → 3 (allowed)
- 3 → 1 (forced)
- 1 → 2 (choose 2 rather than 7)
This forms a cycle 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 that never visits event6. Since the nondeterministic choices can always keep the system in this cycle, event6 is not guaranteed to occur on all paths.

C1 is false, so C2 is True.

We need to decide whether C2 is guaranteed true given the transition rules and initial event6.

Counterexample construction:

- From event6 we may go to event4 (allowed).
- From event4 we may go to event6 (allowed).
- Repeat 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 → ... forever, always choosing transitions that avoid event3.

- To disprove ""If C1 (Event2 always happens) then event3 happens"" it suffices to exhibit a valid run where event2 indeed keeps occurring while event3 never occurs.
- Example valid cycle: 6 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → ... This obeys all successor rules and contains event2 repeatedly but never event3.

- In the next state none of these is event7, so ""event7 happens"" is false in that state.
- An implication ""if event7 then event5"" is vacuously true when the antecedent is false.
- Therefore C1 (If event7 happens, then event5 happens) holds in the next state, so C2 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", i.e. simply ""Event3 happens"".
- C2 asserts: if event2 happens, then event3 happens.
- We need only one valid scenario (consistent with the given rules) where event2 occurs but event3 never occurs to show C2 is false.

Counterexample trace consistent with the rules (starts from the given initial event5):
- Initially event5 happens.
- From event5 choose event6 (allowed: after event5 either event4 or event6).
- From event6 choose event2 (allowed: after event6 either event2 or event3).
- From event2 choose event5 (allowed: after event2 either event5 or event7).
- Repeat: event5 -> event6 -> event2 -> ... indefinitely.

This cycle (event2 -> event5 -> event6 -> event2 -> ...) never produces event3, so event2 can occur without event3 ever happening. Therefore C2 is false."

Reasoning summary:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event3 happens and event4 happens."" C2 is its negation.
- The context states event3 happens initially.
- From event3 you can go to event7 (allowed), and from event7 you can go to event4.
- Thus there is a valid sequence (event3 → event7 → event4) in which both event3 and event4 occur, so C1 can be true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed and so is False."

Reasoning (step by step):
- C1 says ""event5 happens"" (the repetition ""event5 or event5"" is equivalent to event5). C2 says ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. event5 does not happen.
- From the context, initially event1 happened and after event1 either event4 or event5 must happen.
- So there is a path where event5 does happen (choose event1 → event5). Therefore C2 (that event5 never happens) cannot be true in all cases.
- There is also a path that avoids event5 forever (e.g. event1 → event4 → event6 → event1 → event4 ...), so C1 is not guaranteed either.
- Because C2 asserts that event5 does not hold but the context allows event5 to happen, C2 is false."

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is equivalent to ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — check reachability from the context:

- From event2 one possible next event is event3 (rule: after event2 → {event3,event6,event7}).
- From event3 one possible next event is event1 (rule: after event3 → {event1,event2,event4,event5}).

Thus there is a valid sequence 2 → 3 → 1 in which event1 does happen. Therefore C1 can be true; the premises do not force event1 to be false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event2 ever occurs then event2 must thereafter always occur.
- Start from the initial state: event3 happened.
- There is a legal sequence that makes event2 occur: event3 -> event5 -> event2 (after event3 you may choose event5; after event5 you may choose event2).
- After that occurrence of event2, the rules allow transitions that avoid event2 forever: from event2 you can choose event1; from event1 you can choose event3; from event3 you can choose event7; from event7 you can choose event3 again, and then loop 3↔7 indefinitely. This infinite loop never includes event2.
- Therefore event2 can happen at some time but is not guaranteed to always happen thereafter. So the implication in C2 is false."

Counterexample (one possible infinite run showing C2 can fail):
- Start: event7.
- From 7 choose event6 (allowed).

- From 3 choose event4 (allowed).
- From 4 choose event7 (allowed).
- Repeat the cycle 7 → 6 → 3 → 4 → 7 … if desired.

In this run event3 does occur, but event2 never occurs (we always choose successors that avoid event1, which is the only place that can lead to event2). Thus C1 (""if event3 then event2"") is false in this run, and event2 does not happen, so C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds"") is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is: (event2 does not happen) OR (event3 happens).
- To show C2 is not necessarily true, it suffices to give a permitted sequence where event2 does occur and event3 never occurs (so C1 is false and event3 is false).
- Start with the given initial event6. After event6 we may choose event2 (allowed).
- After event2 we may choose event4 (allowed). After event4 event1 must happen (allowed). After event1 we may choose event2 (allowed). After event2 we may choose event5 (allowed). After event5 we may choose event6 (allowed). After event6 choose event1, then event2, then repeat — none of these choices ever require event3.
- This infinite trace is consistent with all the given rules, contains event2, and never contains event3. Thus C1 is false and event3 is false in that trace, so C2 is false (not entailed)."

This sequence yields both event6 and event4 (so C1 holds) while event3 never occurs. Therefore it is not true that C1 necessarily implies event3.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From event7 either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- If event3 happens immediately, then ""event3 or event5"" (C1) is true, so C2 (the negation) is false.
- Although there exist alternative choices (e.g. 7 → 1 → 6 → 4 → 6 → …) that avoid both event3 and event5, that only shows C1 is not guaranteed; it does not make C2 necessarily true.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: event2 or event1 happens.
- Hypothesis C2: If C1 holds, then event6 happens.

From the rules (and initial event3), we have:
- After event3 we may choose event2 (3 → 2).
- After event2 we may choose event1 (2 → 1).
- After event1 we may choose event2 (1 → 2).

Thus a valid sequence is: event3, event2, event1, event2, event1, ... repeating 2 ↔ 1 forever. In that execution C1 holds (event2 and event1 occur) but event6 never occurs. Therefore C2 (""if C1 then event6"") is not guaranteed by the rules. Hence C2 is False."

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event6 occurs, so by the rule ""after event6, event1 must happen"" we get event1.
- After event1, event5 must happen.

Start: event5 happens.
From the rules:
- After event5, event2 is allowed.
- After event2, event4 is allowed.

So there is a valid sequence 5 → 2 → 4 in which event2 happens and event4 also happens. That violates C1, so the implication ""if event2 happens then event4 does not happen"" is false.

Reasoning (counterexample):

- After event5, event1 is allowed, so take event1.
- After event1, event5 is allowed, so return to event5.

Interpretation: C1 means that in every possible allowed sequence starting from the initial event7, event3 must occur at some point (i.e., occurrence of event3 is unavoidable). C2 is the negation: there exists an allowed infinite sequence starting at event7 that never contains event3.

Check the transition graph (condensed):

- 7 -> {2,4,5,6}
- 2 -> {1,3,4,7}
- 4 -> {5,7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,4}
- 6 -> {1,3,4,7}
- 1 -> {2,5,7}
- 3 -> {7}

We need only find one infinite path from 7 that avoids node 3 to show C1 is false (so C2 true). One such cycle is:

7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> ...  

All chosen transitions are allowed and none are 3:
- 7 -> 4
- 4 -> 5
- 5 -> 1
- 1 -> 2
- 2 -> 7

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., whenever event7 occurs, the following state must be event2.
- From the rules: initially event2. From event2 you can go to event3, event5, or event6. From event3 you can go to event1 (among others). From event1 you can go to event7. So event7 is reachable (e.g. 2 → 3 → 1 → 7).
- After event7 the allowed next events are {event1, event2, event4, event5}. That includes event1, so there is an execution 2 → 3 → 1 → 7 → 1 where the state after 7 is event1, not event2.
- Because there exists an execution where event7 occurs but the next state is not event2, the implication ""if event7 then C1"" is not guaranteed.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event5 does not happen"".
- To make C2 false, we need both: Event2 does not happen, and Event5 does happen.
- Start from the given initial event6. After event6, event3 must happen (rule).
- After event3, one option is event5 (rules allow event1, event5, or event6). Choose event5.
- After event5, one allowed successor is event6 (rules allow event1, event2, or event6). Choose event6 to avoid event2.
- That returns to event6 → event3 → event5 → event6 → ... repeating.
- This infinite (or finite) loop contains event5 but never contains event2, and it obeys all given constraints.
- Therefore there exists a valid scenario where Event5 happens and Event2 does not, which makes C2 false."

- C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" So we must decide whether, given the context, C2 is true.

- The context explicitly says ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 happens unconditionally (at the start).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 says: ""If event3 happens, then event1 does not happen.""
- We can refute this by giving a valid sequence (consistent with the ""after"" rules) where event3 happens and event1 also happens.
- Start: event4 (given).
- From event4 we may go to event6 (rule: after event4 → {1,2,5,6,7}).
- From event6 we may go to event3 (rule: after event6 → {2,3}).
- From event3 we may go to event2 (rule: after event3 → {2,5,6}).
- From event2 we may go to event1 (rule: after event2 → {1,6,7}).

Thus the sequence 4 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 1 is allowed; event3 occurs and event1 occurs afterward. That is a counterexample to the implication, so C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the rules: 1 -> {5,7}; 5 -> {4,6}; 4 -> {1,2,6}; 6 -> {2,4}; 2 -> 5; 3 -> 1; 7 -> {1,2,3,6}.
- To show C1 false it suffices to find a possible execution where 5 occurs but 2 never occurs. Possible path:
  1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> ... 
  This loop repeatedly chooses 5 then 4 then 1, never choosing the branches that lead to event2 or event6. So event5 can happen while event2 never happens. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (false).
- Because C1 is false, C2 would be true only if event6 is inevitable. But the same loop above also avoids event6 forever, so event6 is not forced.

Step 3 — evaluate C2

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The only rule that allows event7 to occur is ""After event4, either event2, event3, or event7 must happen.""
- No other event has event7 as a possible next event.
- Therefore any occurrence of event7 must be immediately preceded by an occurrence of event4.

- Initially event2 happened (given). So in every accepted sequence, event2 is true (it has occurred).
- C1 states: ""Event6 happens and event2 happens."" That is equivalent to (event6 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2 states: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds."" This is equivalent to: event6 -> (event6 AND event2). Logically that reduces to event6 -> event2.
- Since event2 has already happened initially, event2 is true in every sequence regardless of whether event6 occurs. Therefore whenever event6 happens, event2 is already true, so C1 holds.
- Thus C2 is true.

C2 is false exactly if there exists a valid sequence in which Event6 happens and Event7 never happens.

Step 2 — examine allowed transitions (deduplicated)

- 1 → 5 (allowed)

This run contains Event6 and does not contain Event7. Thus C1 is false and Event7 did not happen, so C2 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event2 happened."" That is a given fact of the scenario.
- C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen,"" which contradicts the given fact. There is no model of the context in which C1 is true.
- In classical logic, an implication ""If A then B"" is true whenever A is impossible (there are no models with A true); such an implication is vacuously true.
- Therefore, under the given premises, ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"" is true (vacuously, because C1 cannot hold)."

- C1: If event4 happens, then event3 happens (i.e. every time event4 occurs it must be followed by event3).
- C2: If event7 happens, then C1 holds (i.e. whenever event7 occurs, the rule in C1 must be true).

Step 2 — use the transition rules to produce a counterexample
Start at the given initial event1 and follow allowed transitions:
1 -> 7 (allowed: after event1 may be 3 or 7).
7 -> 2 (after 7 may be 1,2,3,5).
2 -> 6 (after 2 may be 1,5,6).
6 -> 4 (after 6 may be 1,2,4).
4 -> 2 (after 4 may be 2,3,5,6,7).

In this sequence event7 does occur (at the second step), and later event4 occurs and is followed by event2 (not event3). That shows C1 is false in this model (an occurrence of event4 is not followed by event3), despite event7 having occurred.

Therefore C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initial event is event2. From event2 the possible next events are {3, 5}.
- If we choose event3 next, from the rule for event3 one possible next event is event7.
- From event7 the rules allow event6, and from event6 the rules allow event7 again. Thus there is a reachable cycle 7 -> 6 -> 7 that can repeat indefinitely.
- Therefore starting from the initial event2 we can reach traces where event7 occurs and indeed can occur infinitely often.
- C1 says “event7 does not happen” (i.e., no occurrence of event7). C2 says “C1 eventually holds” (i.e., eventually event7 will stop happening forever). Because there exist traces in which event7 continues to occur (forever), C2 is not guaranteed and is false."

Reason: Initially event1 happens. Choose the successor event3 (allowed because after event1 one of {event3,event4,event5} must happen). After event3 choose event1 (allowed because after event3 one of {event1,event6} must happen). Repeating 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 ... satisfies all ""after"" constraints and never produces event4.

Start: event2 happened initially. From 2 we can go to 7 (2 -> 7). From 7 we can go to 4 (7 -> 4). That yields a valid sequence 2 → 7 → 4 in which both event7 and event4 occur, and event6 never occurs.

Step 2 — examine the rules and look for a sequence that avoids events 2 and 6
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, one of {4, 5, 6, 7} must happen. To avoid 6, choose event5.
- After event5, event1 must happen. So we get the cycle 1 -> 5 -> 1.

- Find a counterexample path starting from the initial event7:

  Here event6 occurs, and the next state is event1, not event5. Thus C1 (event5 in the next state) is false in this situation.

Because there exists a reachable occurrence of event6 that is followed by an event other than event5, the implication in C2 does not hold in general. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context, the system of transitions is:
  - Initially event1 has happened.
  - 1 -> {4,5,6,7}
  - 3 -> 4
  - 4 -> {1,3,5}
  - 5 -> {3,4,6,7}
  - 6 -> {1,7}
  - 7 -> {3,4,6}
  - 2 -> {1,3,7}

- C1 is the statement ""Event5 eventually happens."" That may or may not occur on a particular run (from 1 you can choose 5, but you can also choose 4,6,7), so C1 is not guaranteed.

- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since event1 is given as having happened initially, any trace in which event5 later occurs already contains event1. Therefore the implication (C1 ⇒ event1 happens) is true.

(If one instead interprets C2 to mean ""if event5 occurs then event1 occurs afterward,"" that stronger claim is not guaranteed — e.g. 5 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... can avoid ever returning to 1. But under the usual reading that ""event1 happens"" anywhere in the trace, C2 is True.)"

1) From the context, after initial event6 the next state must be either event1 or event7.
2) To show C1 fails in that next state it suffices to exhibit a possible future from that state where event3 occurs but event5 never occurs.
3) From event1 we can go to event3 (1 -> 3). From event3 we can go back to event1 (3 -> 1). Thus there is a reachable cycle 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... that never visits event5.
4) Therefore, in the next state = event1 (which is one of the required next states), C1 is false (because event3 can occur without event5 ever happening). The same counterexample also works if the next state were event7 (7 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...).
5) Hence C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 is the statement ""if event5 happens then event1 happens"" (event5 → event1).
- C2 is ""if event1 happens then C1 holds"", i.e. event1 → (event5 → event1).
- In propositional logic the formula P → (Q → P) is a tautology: if P is true, then Q → P is true regardless of Q.
- Therefore whenever event1 occurs, the implication ""if event5 then event1"" is true, so C2 is true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happens (given).
- To get event3, one valid path is: event5 -> event4 (allowed after event5) -> event3 (allowed after event4). So C1 (event5 and event3 happen) can hold.
- After event3, the next event must be event4 or event5. From event5 the choice is again event2 or event4. By always choosing event4 after event5 (and choosing event4 after event3), we can loop through 3,4,5 indefinitely without ever taking the transition to event2.
- Event1 can only occur as a consequence of event2 (after event2 one option is event1). Since we can avoid event2 forever while still having both event5 and event3 occur, event1 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is not necessarily true."

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurred. After event5 the next event must be either event3 or event6.
- If event3 occurs, then the following event can be event2, event4, or event7 — so event4 is possible.
- But after event4 the next event must be event1, event2, or event3 (no option for event5).
- Therefore there are reachable cases where event4 happens but the next state is not event5, so the implication ""if event4 happens, then event5 happens in the next state"" is false."

- C1: ""Event6 always happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" So C2 asserts: whenever event2 occurs, event6 will necessarily occur (in all continuations).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (allowed next events)
- After 2 → must go to 1.
- After 1 → can go to 3, 4, or 7.
- After 3 → can go to 1, 2, or 4.
- After 4 → can go to 2 or 5.
- After 7 → can go to 1, 4, or 6.
- After 5 → can go to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.
- After 6 → can go to 2, 4, or 7.
- Initially event3 happened (so sequences start at 3).

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2
- From the initial 3, 3 → 2 is allowed, so event2 can happen.
- After 2 we must go 2 → 1.
- From 1 choose 1 → 3 (allowed).
- Now 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 … can repeat forever (both 1→3 and 3→1 are allowed).
- This infinite loop contains event2 (it occurred earlier) but never includes event6.

Because there is a valid continuation in which event2 happens yet event6 never occurs, the implication ""If event2 happens, then event6 always happens"" is false.

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 already happened, so ""event5 happens"" (the first part of C1) is true regardless.
- C2 says: if event3 happens then event4 must also happen (since event5 already holds).
- But we can exhibit a valid sequence where event3 happens and event4 never happens:
  - Start: event5 (initial).
  - Choose event3 next (allowed: after event5 -> {1,3,4,6}).
  - From event3 choose event1 (allowed: after event3 -> {1,4,6}).
  - From event1 choose event3 (allowed: after event1 -> {3,4,7}).
  - Repeat the 3 ↔ 1 cycle indefinitely, never choosing event4.
- Thus there is a possible run where event3 occurs but event4 does not, so C1 need not hold when event3 happens. Therefore C2 is false."

- C1 = ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" i.e. (not event4) OR event2.

To show C2 is false it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence (consistent with the rules and the initial condition) in which event4 does happen and event2 never happens.

Step 2 — construct a valid sequence avoiding event2 but including event4:
- Initially event5 (given).
- After event5, event7 must happen → 5 → 7.
- From 7 we may choose 1 (options: 1,2,3,5) → 7 → 1.

- From 4 choose 5 (options: 1,5,6,7) → 4 → 5.
- From 5 → 7 (forced), and repeat the cycle 7 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 7 …

This infinite cycle is allowed by the rules, contains event4, and never picks event2. Therefore C1 is false (event4 does happen) and event2 never happens, so C2 = (C1 or event2) is false in this model.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, transitions are:
  - 1 -> {3,5,6,7}
  - 2 -> {5,6,7}
  - 3 -> {1,2,5,6}
  - 4 -> {1,2,3,5,7}
  - 5 -> {2,3,4,6}
  - 6 -> {4,5,7}
  - 7 -> {3,5,6}
  - Initial event: 2 happened.

- C1 says event7 happens. To test C2 (""if C1 then event5 happens"") we must check whether there is any valid sequence consistent with the rules and initial condition where event7 occurs but event5 never occurs.

- Construct such a sequence:
  - Start: 2 -> 7 (allowed by 2 -> {5,6,7}) — event7 has occurred, still no event5.
  - 7 -> 3 (allowed) — still no 5.
  - 3 -> 2 (allowed) — back to 2, still no 5.
  - Repeat 2 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2 ... indefinitely.
  This cycle contains event7 and never uses event5.

- Therefore, it is possible for C1 to hold while event5 does not happen. The implication C1 => event5 is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False."

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event5 always happens"" means every allowed sequence (starting from the initial event) must include event5 at some point.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., there exists at least one valid sequence in which event5 never occurs.

Step 2 — the rules (edges)
From the given rules we have transitions:
- 6 -> {1,3,5}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,6}
- 2 -> {4,5}
- 4 -> {1,2}
- 3 -> {1,4,5,6,7}
- 5 -> {1,2,3}
- 7 -> {4,5,6}

Initial event is 6.

Step 3 — exhibit a valid sequence that avoids event5
Start at 6 and pick transitions that never go to 5:
- 6 -> 1 (allowed)
- 1 -> 2 (allowed)
- 2 -> 4 (allowed; choose 4 instead of 5)
- 4 -> 1 (allowed)

Now we can repeat 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 forever. This cycle (1,2,4) is fully allowed by the rules and never visits event5.

Conclusion
Because there exists a valid infinite sequence starting from the initial event6 that never contains event5, C1 is false and therefore C2 is True.

Reasoning (counterexample run):
- Initially event1 happens.
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 event3 must happen (forced).
- Repeat the cycle 3 → 5 → 6 → 3 indefinitely.

- C1 is the formula ""if event7 happens, then event7 happens"" (event7 → event7).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the run, event7 → event7 is true).

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- The implication P → P is a logical tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether P (event7) is true or false.

Step 3 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 is true in every state (including the initial state), C1 already holds, so it certainly holds at some point in the future. Therefore C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Identify the hypothesis: C2 asserts that if C1 holds (i.e., event1 does not happen), then event7 happens.
- From the context: ""Initially, event7 happened."" That means event7 has occurred in the sequence from the start.
- C1 only forbids event1; it does not prevent the already-occurring initial event7.
- Therefore whenever C1 holds, event7 still happens (it happened initially), so the implication ""If C1 then event7"" is satisfied.

C2 is the negation: ""neither event3 nor event2 happens.""

We can satisfy C2 by exhibiting a valid event sequence (following the ""after X, one of {...} must happen"" rules) that never includes event2 or event3. Starting from the given initial event6:

- After event6 choose event1 (allowed: 6 -> {1,4,7}).
- After event1 choose event4 (allowed: 1 -> {3,4,5}).
- After event4 choose event1 (allowed: 4 -> {1,2,3,7}).

Repeat 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 ... indefinitely. At no point in this infinite sequence do event2 or event3 occur, and each step respects the allowed successors.

Therefore it is possible that neither event3 nor event2 ever happens, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") can be true.

- After event5 the only allowed next event is event3.

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") would require that at every step from some point onward the event is event2.
- But from event2 the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event6} — event2 cannot follow event2. Thus it is impossible to have event2 at every future step.
- Since C1 can never become true at any point, ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: event5 does not happen.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens (i.e., every valid continuation with no event5 must include event2).

Step 2 — examine transitions (from the context)
- After event4: next ∈ {2,6,7}.
- After event6: next ∈ {1,3,5,7}.
- After event1: next ∈ {2,3,4,7}.
- After event3: next ∈ {1,2,5,6,7}.
- After event7: next ∈ {3,4}.
- After event5: no further events.
(repeated lines in the context do not add new rules)

Step 3 — construct a counterexample where event5 never occurs and event2 never occurs
- Start: event4 (given).
- Choose next = event6 (allowed because after event4 we can pick 6).
- From event6 choose next = event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose next = event4 (allowed).
- Now we can repeat: 4 → 6 → 1 → 4 → 6 → 1 → ... indefinitely.
This infinite (or arbitrarily long) sequence never includes event5 and never includes event2, and every step follows the allowed transitions.

Conclusion
- Because there exists a valid execution where C1 holds (no event5) but event2 never happens, the implication C2 is not guaranteed.

Step 2 — summarize relevant transition rules (deduplicated)

This infinite run is permitted by the rules (3→5 and 5→3 are both allowed) and never visits event4 or event6. Thus C1 does not hold on this run.

Reasoning:
- From the rules the possible transitions (unique) are:
  7 -> {3,4,5}
  3 -> 5
  4 -> {2,6,7}
  5 -> {2,7}
  2 -> {1,6,7}
  6 -> {2,3,7}
  1 -> {3,5,7}

- C1 says ""event6 eventually happens."" To refute that, it suffices to exhibit a valid infinite sequence with no 6.
- Starting at the initial event7, choose 3, then 5, then 7, and repeat: 7 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> ...
  All transitions in this cycle are allowed, and no event6 ever occurs in this run.

Thus C1 is false (event6 need not eventually happen). C2 is ""C1 holds or event6 happens"", which in this counterexample is also false. Therefore the hypothesis C2 is False."

Summary of relevant rules:
- Initially event6 happens.
- After event6, either event1 or event7 must happen.
- After event7, one of event1, event2, event3, or event6 must happen.
- After event3, one of event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event5, one of event3, event4, event6, or event7 must happen.
(Other rules exist but are not needed for the core argument.)

Can C2 occur? Yes — for example:
- Start: event6 (initial).
- From event6 choose event7.
- From event7 choose event3.
- From event3 choose event5.
This produces events 3, 7 and 5, so C2 is possible.

Is C2 guaranteed by the rules (i.e., must be true in every possible run)? No — the choices are nondeterministic. From the initial event6 one could choose event1 instead of event7, and further choices could avoid event3 and/or event5 entirely. Thus C2 is not entailed as necessarily true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e., at every step the event is event5).
- Initially event5 happens, but the rule ""After event5, either event1 or event4 must happen"" forces the next event to be event1 or event4 — neither is event5. So C1 is already violated immediately after the initial event5.
- For C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") to be true there would have to be some future point after which every event is event5. That would require event5 to be able to follow event5 (a self-loop), so you could have two consecutive event5 occurrences and then continue with only event5. But the rules forbid event5 following event5 (after event5 the only options are event1 or event4).
- Therefore it is impossible for the system to reach a point where event5 happens at every subsequent step, so C2 is false."

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context, after event2 the next event must be either event1 or event4.
- After event1 the next event may be event3, event6, or event7.
- These choices are nondeterministic (the rules say ""either ... or ... must happen""), so multiple continuations are possible.

Counterexample showing C2 is not forced:
- Take the trace: event2 (initial) → event1 (allowed after event2) → event6 (allowed after event1).
- This valid trace satisfies the rules but makes ""event6 happens"" true, so C1 (""event6 does not happen"") is false, and thus C2 is false in this trace.

Because there exists at least one valid sequence consistent with the rules in which C2 is false, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

We can satisfy the constraints while avoiding event2. For example:
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1 choose event4 (allowed: event2, event4, or event5).
- After event4 choose event1 (allowed: event1, event3, or event7).
- Repeat event1 → event4 → event1 → ... forever.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says: whenever event5 happens, event6 happens.
- C2 asserts C1 always holds (i.e., C1 is a necessary consequence of the given rules).
- From the rules: after event5 must come event1, and after event1 one may choose event2, event4, event5, or event6.
- There is a valid sequence starting from the initial event4 that produces event5 but never produces event6: for example,
  - Start: event4 -> choose event1,
  - event1 -> choose event5,
  - event5 -> event1 (forced),
  - event1 -> choose event5 again,
  - and so on indefinitely (looping 5 -> 1 -> 5 ...).
- This sequence contains event5 but can avoid event6 forever, so event5 does not entail event6 under the given rules.
Therefore C2 is False."

- From the initial event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event5, event6}.

- C1 is possible but not guaranteed; it is not entailed by the rules.

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 occurs. The immediate next events possible are event4, event5, or event6.
- To have ""C1 holds in the next state"" (C2 true) we would need that in every possible next state, ""event4 eventually happens"" is guaranteed.
- Consider the next state where event5 happens. From event5 the allowed transitions include event1, and from event1 you can go back to event5. So there is an infinite loop 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ... that never visits event4.
- Because there exists a next-state (the one after event5) with a continuation that never reaches event4, C1 is not guaranteed in that next state. Therefore C2 is False."

- C1 is ""event5 happens in the next state."" That is not guaranteed, because event2 or event3 are also allowed next.
- C2 is ""C1 or event6 happens in the next state."" For C2 to be guaranteed, either event5 must be forced next or event6 must be forced next.

We only need one valid execution that violates C2 to show C2 is not guaranteed. From 3 we can choose 7; from 7 choose 1; from 1 choose 3; and repeat:
3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...
This infinite cycle never visits event6 (nor event4). Therefore event6 is not forced to happen (C1 is false), and event4 is not forced to happen either. Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is not satisfied.

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context: 7 happens initially, so 7 -> 2 must occur.
- But after 2 we may choose 2 -> 5. After 5 choose 5 -> 1. After 1 choose 1 -> 3. After 3 we are allowed to choose 3 -> 1 (the rule is 3 -> {1,2}).
- That gives a valid trace 7 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 ... in which event3 occurs but we repeatedly choose the 3 -> 1 branch and never take 3 -> 2 afterwards.
- Therefore ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed by the rules, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

2. C2 additionally requires that Event3 happens. We must check whether Event3 is guaranteed by the transition rules, starting from the initial event6.

3. From event6 the next event must be one of {3,4,7}. If 3 is chosen, then Event3 happens and C2 holds. But the rules allow other choices: from 6 we can choose 4, and from 4 we can choose 6 (since after 4 the options include 6). That yields a cycle 6 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> ... that never produces event3. Because choices are nondeterministic, such a run is allowed by the rules and avoids event3 indefinitely.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event3 happens, so event7 must follow.
- From event7 choose event1 (allowed). From event1 choose event2 (allowed). From event2 choose event3 (allowed). From event3 we again must do event7.
- This yields a repeating cycle 3 → 7 → 1 → 2 → 3 that never uses event4, and all transitions in the cycle are permitted by the rules.
- Because there exists a valid sequence in which event4 never happens, C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. event4 does happen) is not necessarily true. Hence C2 is False."

We can choose a valid continuation that avoids event2: pick event1 after event7. After event1 we may choose event4 (avoiding event2). After event4 we may choose event6 (avoiding event2).

We can disprove that by giving a valid sequence that never includes event4:

- Initially event3 happens.
- From event3 one allowed next event is event6 (rule: after event3 → {4,5,6}).
- From event6 one allowed next event is event1 (rule: after event6 → {1,7}).
- From event1 one allowed next event is event2 (rule: after event1 → {2,4,5,7}).
- After event2 no further events occur (rule: after event2 → none).

  - If event1 occurs, then C1 (and thus C2) is true.
  - But if the choice is event7, then from event7 the rules force either event1 or event4.
    - If event4 is chosen again, we return to the same situation (event4 → event7 → event4 → ...), and can loop indefinitely without ever producing event1 or event3.

- From the rules: 5 -> 4. From 4 we can go to 3 (since 4 -> {1,2,3,7}). From 3 we can go to 5 (since 3 -> {1,5,6}). That yields a cycle 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 that never visits event1 or event6. Therefore it is possible to avoid event1 and event6 indefinitely.

Look for whether event6 is forced by the given rules or whether there is a valid sequence starting from event7 that avoids event6.

From the rules:
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7 one of {2,3,5} must happen.
- After event2 one of {1,3,4} must happen.
- After event1 one of {3,4,5,7} must happen.
- (Other rules allow transitions from 3,4,5,6 to various events; in particular after 5 → 6, and after 3 you may choose 6, but it's optional.)

Exhibit a sequence that avoids event6: 7 → 2 → 1 → 7 → 2 → 1 → ... .
- 7 → 2 is allowed.
- 2 → 1 is allowed.
- 1 → 7 is allowed.
This cycle never requires choosing event6, so there is a valid execution in which event6 never happens. Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""event6 happens"") is not entailed.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules, the initial event3 leads to event7, and from event7 event5 is possible: 3 -> 7 -> 5. So event2 is reachable because after event5 one possible next event is event2: 3 -> 7 -> 5 -> 2.
- C1 says: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" To refute C1 it suffices to exhibit a valid continuation after event2 that does not lead to event5.
- After event2 the allowed next events include event1 (as well as event3,4,5,6,7). So we can pick event1 and then loop between 1 and 2 without ever taking a transition to 5: 3 -> 7 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ...
- This shows a valid execution where event2 occurs but event5 does not follow, so C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event4 (given).
- From event4 we can go to event6.
- From event6 we can go to event3.
- From event3 we can go to event1 (instead of event2).
- From event1 we can go back to event3.
- Repeating the choices 3 -> 1 and 1 -> 3 yields an infinite trace 4,6,3,1,3,1,... that never visits event2.

Thus event2 is not guaranteed to happen in every possible execution (C1 is false). Although event1 can occur in some runs, C2 requires C1 to hold as well, so C2 is false."

- C2 states: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. at every step the current event must be event2 or event6.

- Initially event2 happens, so C1 holds at the start.
- After event2, the rules require either event3 or event5 to happen next.
- If event3 (or event5) happens next, the current event is not event2 nor event6, so C1 is false at that step.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 asserts both (a) event7 happens, and (b) C1 holds where C1 = ""if event1 happens, then event3 happens"".
- From the rules we start at event4. From event4 one possible next is event3, and from event3 one possible next is event1. From event1 one allowed next is event2, and from event2 one allowed next is event1. So there is a valid infinite trace:
  4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ...
  This trace never visits event7 and never visits event3 after the first occurrence (in particular, after the occurrence of event1 there is a continuation with no later event3).
- Therefore (a) event7 does not have to happen (it can be avoided), and (b) C1 is not guaranteed (we can have event1 occur and then never see event3 afterward).
- Since both parts of C2 are not entailed, C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 = ""Event2 happens and Event4 eventually happens."" For C2 to be true it must hold in every allowed sequence starting from the initial event3.
- From the context we have non-deterministic successor rules. Starting at event3, allowed next events are {4,5,7}.
- It is enough to exhibit one valid infinite trace (consistent with all rules) in which either event2 never occurs or event4 never occurs to show C2 is not guaranteed.
- Consider this valid cycle starting from the initial event3:
  3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> ...
  Each step is allowed by the given rules (3→5, 5→7, 7→6, 6→3). This cycle never visits event4 and never visits event2.
- Therefore event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen and event2 is not guaranteed to happen. Hence C1 is not necessarily true and C2 (which requires both) is not necessarily true.

Because C2 is not entailed by the rules from the initial condition, the correct answer is False."

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context, after event2 the possible next events are {1, 3, 5}. After event1 the possible next events are {2, 4, 6, 7}. These choices are nondeterministic (“either ... must happen”).
- To show C2 is not entailed, it suffices to give a permitted infinite run that never hits event5 nor event6.
- Consider the run: 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... . Each step respects the rules (2 can go to 1; 1 can go to 2). This infinite cycle never visits event5 or event6, so C1 (event5 eventually happens) is false on this run and event6 never occurs either.
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds or event6 happens) is not guaranteed by the context.

Hence the correct answer is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 is the conjunction of C1 (""If event4 happens, then event2 happens"") and ""event1 happens"".
- From the context we have an initial event6 and allowed transitions. In particular:
  - After event6 one allowed next is event4 (6 → 4).
  - After event4 one allowed next is event3 (4 → 3).
  - After event3 one allowed next is event4 (3 → 4).
- Thus there is a valid sequence 6 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... that keeps repeating 4 and 3 forever, never producing event2. This is a concrete counterexample to C1 (event4 does not force event2).
- Because C1 is not guaranteed, the conjunction C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") cannot be guaranteed either.

Therefore C2 is False."

  - 2 -> {1,3,5,7}

  - 5 -> {6}

- Starting from the initial event1, we can choose the following valid sequence that contains event2 but never event5:

- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and Event7 does not happen.""

Step 2 — summarize the relevant transition rules (unique ones)
- Start: event1 happened.
- After 1 → {4, 5, 6}
- After 2 → {1, 4, 5, 7}
- After 3 → {2, 4, 5}
- After 4 → {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}

- After 7 → {1, 4, 5}

Step 3 — look for a counterexample (a valid sequence that violates C2)
- From the start: 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ... is a valid infinite loop (after 1 you may pick 5; after 5 you must go to 1).
- In that sequence event3 never occurs and event7 never occurs either. C2 requires that event3 happens; here it does not. So C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Conclusion
- C2 is not necessarily true (we have a valid sequence respecting all rules where event3 does not happen). Therefore:

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event7 always happens"" — this claims 7 occurs in every future state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — claims that, from the immediate successor of the initial state, 7 will always occur thereafter.

From the rules:
- Initially event4 happened, so the next event must be one of {1,3,5}.
- None of 3 or 5 ever force event7 (3 → {1,2,5}; 5 → {3,4}).
- Events 1 and 2 allow event7 but do not require it (1 → {2,3,5,7}; 2 → {1,3,5,7}).

Construct a concrete infinite run avoiding 7:
- Start: 4.
- Choose next = 1 (allowed).
- Then choose 2 (allowed).
- Then 1, then 2, ... alternate 1 and 2 forever.

At no point is 7 forced in that run, so event7 does not always happen. Therefore C1 is false in general, and C1 does not hold in the next state. So C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event is 3.
- From 3 one possible successor is 5; from 5 the only successor is 3. So there is a valid infinite trace 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... .
- That trace never contains event2, so C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- That same trace also never contains event6, so ""Event6 happens"" is false on that trace.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, either event1, event3, event6, or event7 must happen"" means the next state must be one of {event1, event3, event6, event7}.
- C1 is ""event6 or event3 happens"". C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state (i.e., the next event is 3 or 6).
- But since event1 and event7 are also allowed as the next event after event4, there are valid next states where neither event3 nor event6 occurs (for example: event4 -> event1).

- After event6, either event2 or event4 must happen. Choose event2.
- After event2, one allowed option is event7.
- So the sequence 6 → 2 → 7 is permitted, so event7 can occur while event6 has occurred.

Reasoning, step by step:

- Hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event1 always happens."" So C2 claims there is some point in every future execution after which Event1 occurs at every step.

- Examine the rules: From event1 the next event must be one of {event3, event5, event7} — there is no transition from event1 back to event1. Thus you cannot have two consecutive event1 occurrences, so you cannot have a suffix of the run where every future event is event1.

- Because you cannot make every future event equal to event1 from some point onward, C1 can never become true at any time. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

- Therefore the next state could be event4. Since event4 is an allowed immediate successor of event1, we cannot conclude that event4 does not happen in the next state.

- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. C2 is equivalent to ""Event6 happens.""

So we must decide whether event6 is forced to happen (C2 true) or can be avoided (C2 false).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (unique ones):
- Start: event3 happened.
- After event3 → one of {event2, event4, event6, event7}.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event4}.
- After event1 → one of {event5, event7}.
- After event5 → event1.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event3, event5, event7}.
- After event7 → one of {event2, event5, event6}.
- After event6 → one of {event1, event2, event3, event4, event7}.

Step 3 — trace a sequence that avoids event6:
- From initial event3 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 → event1 (forced).
This creates a loop (1 ↔ 5) that never requires event6. Thus there exists a valid sequence in which event6 never happens.

Conclusion:
- Event6 is not forced to occur, so C1 (event6 does not happen) can hold, therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. event6 happens) is not necessarily true.

- C2 asserts two things: (a) event1 happens, and (b) C1 holds, where C1 is ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens.""
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules and the initial event6.

Step 2 — examine the rules and possible traces
- Start: event6 happens.
- From event6: either event4 or event5 must follow.
- From event4: event7 must follow.
- From event5: event7 must follow.
- From event7: either event2, event5, or event6 must follow.
- From event2: either event1, event3, event4, or event5 must follow.
- From event1: event7 must follow.
- From event3: either event1 or event2 must follow.

Step 3 — show event1 need not happen
- Construct a valid infinite trace avoiding event1:
  event6 -> event4 -> event7 -> event6 -> event4 -> event7 -> event6 -> ...
  This is allowed by the rules (after event7 choose event6; after event6 choose event4; after event4 must go to event7), and it never produces event1. So event1 is not guaranteed to happen.

Step 4 — show C1 (""event5 implies event1"") need not hold
- Provide a counterexample trace where event5 occurs but event1 never does:
  event6 -> event5 -> event7 -> event6 -> event4 -> event7 -> event6 -> ...
  After event5 we go to event7 (required), then choose event6 and cycle as above; event1 never appears. Thus event5 can occur without event1 ever happening, so the implication is not guaranteed.

Conclusion
- Since event1 is not guaranteed and C1 is not guaranteed, C2 (""event1 happens and C1 holds"") is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The transition rule for event4 is: after event4, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen.
- The ""next state"" after the initial event4 therefore must be one of event1, event2, or event5.
- C1 is ""event4 happens or event6 happens."" None of the possible next events (event1, event2, event5) satisfy C1.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"Goal: decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is True or False.

1) Interpretations
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" = starting from the initial state (event5) every valid future sequence must at some point include event3 (i.e., event3 is inevitable).
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (so C1 true and event1 also occurs in the sequence).

2) Relevant transition graph (from the statements; start at event5)
- 1 -> {3,5,7}
- 2 -> {3,4,7}
- 3 -> {2,4,5,7}
- 4 -> {1,5,6,7}
- 5 -> {2,4}   (initial state is 5)
- 6 -> {1,3,7}
- 7 -> {1,3,4,6}

3) Counterexample to C1
From the initial event5 we can choose the path:
5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> ...
This is a valid cycle (5->4, 4->1, 1->5 are all allowed). It never visits event3, so event3 is not inevitable.

4) Conclusion
Since C1 is false (we gave a valid infinite path avoiding event3), C2 (which requires C1 to hold) is also false.

- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds"" — a conjunction: event4 happens (at some point) AND event7 is inevitable.

Step 2 — Relevant transition rules (condensed)
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,7}

Initial state: event1 happened.

Step 3 — Can event7 be avoided forever?
- From 1 we may choose 5 (allowed).
- From 5 we may choose 1 (allowed).
- Thus the infinite loop 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... is a valid execution that never visits event7.
- Therefore event7 is not inevitable; C1 is false.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even if event4 could occur on some branches, the conjunction fails because C1 fails).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4, either event2 or event5 must happen next.
- From event2, one of event3, event4, event5, or event6 must follow.
- From event3, one of event4, event6, or event7 must follow.
- If event6 ever happens, then event1 must happen (so to keep event1 from happening we must avoid event6).
- Other transitions allow cycles among 2,3,4,5 that can avoid 6.

Step 3 — construct a satisfying sequence
- Start: event4 (given).
- Choose event2 next (allowed by the rule after event4) — so event2 happens.
- From event2 choose event3 (allowed) to avoid event6.
- From event3 choose event4 (allowed) to avoid event6.
- We can repeat this 2 → 3 → 4 cycle indefinitely, never taking the branch to event6, so event1 is never triggered.

Conclusion
- There exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event2 happens and event1 does not happen. Therefore C2 is satisfiable.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The rules allow 7 to occur initially.
- From 7 one allowed next event is 1 (7 -> 1).
- From 1 one allowed next event is 7 (1 -> 7).
- Thus the infinite trace 7,1,7,1,... is allowed by the rules and never contains event5.
- C1 requires that event5 happens (and event7 happens). Although event7 already occurs, event5 does not occur on the trace above.
- Therefore C1 does not hold on all possible executions, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 the rules allow next = event2, event3, event5, event6, or event7.
- To avoid C2 we must avoid ever having event1, event2, or event7. Choose nondeterministically allowed next events to avoid those: take event4 → event3.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 says “event6 eventually happens.” C2 says “C1 eventually holds,” i.e. “eventually (event6 eventually happens).” Nested eventualities collapse, so C2 is equivalent to “event6 eventually happens.”
- Starting from the initial event7, the rules allow 7 → 1 and 1 → 7. Repeating this choice gives an infinite trace 7,1,7,1,... that never visits event6.
- Because there is a valid infinite execution that avoids event6, event6 is not guaranteed to eventually occur. Thus C1 is not necessarily true, and so C2 is False."

- C1: ""Event6 happens in the next state."" (i.e., immediately after the initial state)
- C2: ""Event7 happens or C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the given conditions.

Step 2 — examine the relevant rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event5, event6}.
So event6 is a possible next event but not forced — event3, event4, or event5 could also occur next. Event7 is not among the immediate successors of event2.

Step 3 — find a counterexample (a permitted sequence that falsifies C2)
- From the initial event2 choose event3 next (allowed by the rules).
- From event3 choose event2 next (allowed by the rules).
This yields the infinite loop 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → … which (a) does not make event6 happen in the next state, and (b) never requires event7 to happen. Thus there is a permitted execution in which neither event6 occurs in the next state nor does event7 ever occur.

- C1 asserts: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 asserts the negation: ""Event2 does not eventually happen.""

We must decide whether C2 is true given the transition rules and the initial event6.

Step 2 — restate the transition rules (deduplicated)
- start: event6
- 1 -> {3,4,7}
- 2 -> {1,3,5,6}
- 3 -> {4,5}
- 4 -> {1,2,3,5,7}
- 5 -> {2,3,4,6,7}
- 6 -> {1,5}
- 7 -> {2,4,5}

Step 3 — look for a possible infinite sequence that never visits event2
From the start event6 we may choose 6 -> 1. From 1 choose 1 -> 3. From 3 choose 3 -> 4. From 4 choose 4 -> 1. That gives the cycle 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 which never includes event2. Thus one possible infinite sequence is:
6, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 1, ... 
This sequence never reaches event2, so ""event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed.

- C1 (event2 inevitably eventually happens) is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. Start: event3 has occurred.

2. From event3 the system can go to event2, event5, or event7. From those it is possible to reach event1 or event4, and from event1 or event4 event6 can occur. So event6 can occur sometimes.

3. But after event6 the rules force the next event to be either event1 or event3 (i.e., event6 → {event1,event3}). Therefore two consecutive event6 occurrences are impossible, and you cannot have every future step be event6.

4. C1 states “Event6 always happens” (i.e., at all future times). That is impossible given step 3, so C1 is false.

5. C2 states “C1 eventually holds” (i.e., there is a time after which C1 is true forever). Since C1 can never be true at any suffix (you cannot have event6 at every subsequent step), C2 is also false.

Therefore C2 is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: Event4 eventually happens (i.e., along every possible run, at some future step event4 occurs).
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" — so C2 is true only if both event3 occurs and event4 is guaranteed to eventually occur.

Step 2 — important transitions (duplicates removed)
- Initially: event6.
- 6 -> {1, 3, 4, 5}
- 1 -> {2, 6}
- 2 -> {3, 4, 6}
- 3 -> {1, 5, 7}
- 4 -> {1, 2, 3, 7}
- 5 -> {1, 2, 6, 7}
- 7 -> {1, 3}

Step 3 — look for a run that avoids event3 and event4 forever
From 6 we can choose 1, from 1 choose 2, from 2 choose 6, and repeat:
6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> ...
None of 1, 2, 6 are 3 or 4, and at each state we always have a choice that stays in {1,2,6}. Thus there exists an infinite run in which neither event3 nor event4 ever occurs.

Conclusion
- Event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen (C1 is not necessarily true).
- Event3 is also not guaranteed to happen.
Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Interpretation used: C1 means that from some point on every step/event is event7 (i.e., event7 holds at all future times). For C2 to be true, there must be a reachable point after which every event is event7.

Start from the given transitions:
- 1 -> {6,7}
- 6 -> {3,4,5}
- 7 -> 4
- 3 -> 6
- 4 -> 2
- 5 -> {1,2,4,6,7}
- 2 -> {4,5,6,7}

Key observation: whenever event7 occurs, the very next event must be event4 (7 -> 4). Thus event7 can never occur twice in a row; there is no transition 7 -> 7. Therefore there is no reachable point after which every event is 7 (you cannot have an infinite tail of only event7).

Hence C1 can never become true, so ""eventually C1"" (C2) is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules, after 6 one may go to 1,4, or 5; after 1 one may go to 2,4,5, or 6.
- There is a valid infinite sequence that never visits event4: for example, 6 → 1 → 6 → 1 → 6 → ... (choose 6→1 and 1→6 repeatedly). All transitions in this sequence are allowed and never involve event4.
- Thus C1 (event4 does not happen) can hold, while event4 still does not happen in that case. So the implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is false (antecedent true, consequent false in this model)."

Reasoning (stepwise):
- Transitions (from the context):
  - 1 → {2,4,5,6}
  - 2 → {3,5,6,7}
  - 3 → {2,4,5,6}
  - 4 → {1,2,3,5,7}
  - 5 → {3,4}
  - 6 → {1,2,3,4,5,7}
  - 7 → {2,3,5}
- Initial event is 4, so we can choose subsequent events freely among 4's successors.
- To show C2 is false, it suffices to exhibit a sequence where event6 occurs but event2 never occurs. One such cycle avoiding event2:
  - 4 → 5 → 3 → 6 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 6 → ... 
  - All steps follow allowed transitions and never include event2, while event6 appears.
- Hence event6 can occur without event2 ever occurring, so ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is false."

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened. From event4 the next event must be either event1 or event5.
- C2 asserts that in that next state C1 holds, where C1 claims “event2 happens in the next state” (i.e., two steps from the initial state).
- Consider the two possible next states:
  - If next = event1, then the following event may be event2 or event5. Event2 is possible but not forced.
  - If next = event5, then the following event may be event2, event4, or event6. Again, event2 is possible but not forced.
- Because there are allowed executions where event2 does not occur at the second step, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed and is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 asks whether ""if event1 does not happen, then event6 happens"" follows from the given rules.
- Only event1 has event6 as a possible successor (""After event1, either event2, event5, or event6 must happen""). No other rule produces event6.
- Therefore, if event1 never occurs, there is no way to reach event6.
- Provide an explicit counterexample (a valid sequence starting from the initial event7 that never uses event1 or event6): 7 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 5 → 2 … (looping). All those transitions are allowed by the rules and contain neither event1 nor event6.
- Since a model exists where C1 (event1 does not happen) holds and event6 does not happen, the implication C1 ⇒ event6 is not valid.

Thus C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event4 happened.
- From event4 the rules allow either event5 or event6 next.
- To show C1 (""If event4 happens, then event2 happens"") fails it suffices to find a permitted continuation from event4 that never produces event2.
- Choose event5 after event4 (allowed). From event5 the rules allow event1 or event4. Choose event4. This yields the cycle 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> ... forever.
- This infinite loop never produces event2, so event4 does not inevitably lead to event2. Therefore C1 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens.
- From event1 one of {event2, event3, event5, event6} must follow — so event6 and event3 are each possible but not forced.
- C2 requires both event6 and event3 to occur. The rules allow sequences where one or both do not occur.
- Counterexample valid sequence: event1 → event2 → event4 → event7. Each step follows the rules and the sequence ends at event7, so event3 and event6 do not occur.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 states ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e., from some point onward every event would have to be event5).
- Check the transition rules: after event5, the next event must be either event1 or event7. There is no rule allowing event5 to follow event5.
- Therefore it is impossible for event5 to occur at every step from some point onward — C1 can never become true.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False."

- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the next must be one of {event2, event4, event7}.
- From event2 next ∈ {event4, event5, event7}.
- From event4 next ∈ {event5, event6, event7}.
- From event5 next ∈ {event4, event6, event7}.
- From event6 next ∈ {event4, event7}.
- From event7 next = event4.
- (Also: after event1 next ∈ {2,4,6,7} but event1 is not reachable from the initial condition.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1: ""If event6 happens, then event3 happens.""
- event3 already happened initially. So in every possible run event3 has occurred (at the start), so the implication ""if event6 happens then event3 happens"" is true in all runs. Thus C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate whether event7 necessarily happens
- From event3 you can choose event4 (or event2 then event4). From event4 you can choose event5. From event5 you can choose event4. So there is a cycle 4 ↔ 5 that can repeat indefinitely without ever taking the branch to event7. That shows event7 is not forced to occur; it may occur on some runs but is not guaranteed on all runs.

Conclusion
- C1 is true, but event7 is not guaranteed, so ""C1 holds and event7 happens"" is not entailed.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initial event is 6. From 6 the allowed next events are {1,2,4,5,7}.
- Event 3 can only occur immediately after event 7 (7 -> {1,2,3,4}). So to ever get a 3 you must at some point take a transition to 7, then take 7 -> 3.
- However, from 6 (and from 1,2,4,5) there are choices that avoid 7: for example
  - 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... is a valid infinite sequence staying within {1,5,6,2,4} and never taking 7.
  - Many cycles exist among {1,2,4,5,6} (e.g. 1↔5, 2→1→5→2, etc.), so one can indefinitely avoid 7.
- Because there exists a valid infinite run that never reaches 7 and therefore never reaches 3, ""Event3 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Thus C1 does not hold, so C2 is True."

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- The system starts at event2. From event2 the rules allow either event3 or event7 next.
- There is a cycle that avoids event5: 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 2 (2 -> 3 is allowed, 3 -> 7 is allowed, 7 -> 2 is allowed). This cycle can repeat indefinitely and never visit event5.
- Therefore ""Event5 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed — there exist executions that never reach event5, so C1 is false.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point from which event5 is inevitable). Because of the above cycle, there is an execution that never reaches any state from which event5 is inevitable, so C2 is also false.

- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" (This is false in general from the start, because the initial event is 7, not 4.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when either (a) event4 occurs always, or (b) event2 occurs at some point.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (edges)
- Start: 7.
- From 7 → {1,2,4,5}
- From 1 → 7
- From 7 can go back to 1, so 1↔7 loop is possible.
- Other transitions exist (e.g. 7→2, 7→4, etc.), but choices are nondeterministic.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample run
- From the initial 7, choose 1. Sequence: 7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → 7 → ...
- This infinite run never visits event2.
- It also does not make ""Event4 always happens"" true (event4 does not occur at all, so ""always"" is false).

Conclusion

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 asserts that the current event is event1 or event5. C2 asserts that C1 holds at all times (in all reachable states).
- The initial event is event4, so C1 is already false at the start.
- Moreover, there is a reachable infinite trace that never hits event1 or event5: 4 → 6 → 2 → 6 → 2 → … (after 4 you can go to 6; after 6 you can go to 2; after 2 you can go to 6), so neither event1 nor event5 ever occurs on that trace.
- Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False."

- With C1 false, C2 is equivalent to ""event4 happens.""

- C1 states: ""If event6 happens, then event3 happens."" (i.e. whenever event6 occurs, event3 must occur afterwards).
- C2 states: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (graph view)
Relevant transitions:
- after event6 → {event1, event2, event3, event5, event7}
- after event1 → {event2, event4, event6, event7}
- after event4 → {event1, event6}
(other transitions exist but these suffice)

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C1 if possible
From event6 we can choose event1 (allowed).
From event1 we can choose event4 (allowed).
From event4 we can choose event6 (allowed).
Thus there is a cycle 6 → 1 → 4 → 6 that never visits event3. So it is possible for event6 to occur and for event3 never to occur afterwards (by repeatedly following that cycle).

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a permissible sequence starting at event6 that avoids event3, C1 is not guaranteed by the rules (C1 is false). Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rule for event2: after event2, either event3 or event5 must happen. So the next state could be event3 but could also be event5.
- C1 asserts ""event3 happens in the next state"" — that is not guaranteed from the initial state because event5 is a valid alternative.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., in every state the next event is event3). This fails immediately from the initial choice (you can choose event5), and you can also construct infinite traces avoiding event3 (for example: event2 → event5 → event1 → event5 → event1 ...), so event3 is not guaranteed at every next-state step.

Therefore C2 is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event5 happens."" (an extra rule we assume holds)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" We must decide whether, assuming C1 is true in addition to the given rules and the initial event5, event4 necessarily happens.

Step 2 — examine the given rules (relevant ones)
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2, event3, event4, event7} must happen.
- After event1, event5 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event3, event5, event7} must happen.
- After event3, one of {event2, event6} must happen.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2} must happen.
- After event6, one of {event1, event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event7, one of {event2, event4, event6} must happen.
- C1 adds: if event3 happens then event5 must (eventually) happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start at event5. From event5 we may choose event1.
- From event1 we are forced back to event5.
- Thus the system can loop: 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ... indefinitely, never visiting event4 (or any other event).
- C1 concerns only what happens if event3 occurs; it does not prevent choosing event1 after event5. So C1 does not force leaving the 5↔1 loop or force event4 to ever occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid execution (5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → …) consistent with all rules and with C1 that never reaches event4, event4 is not forced by assuming C1. Therefore C2 is False.

Start: event4 happened. After event4 one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

Consider the choice event3 next. After event3 the rules force either event5 or event7. If we pick event5, rule says no further events can happen (terminal). The trace 4 → 3 → 5 is valid under the rules. In that trace event3 occurs but event6 does not occur, so C1 never becomes true. Therefore C1 does not necessarily eventually hold.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample (showing C1 need not hold):
- Starting from the given initial event2, one possible sequence is: event2 → event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... .
- After event4 we can choose event1, and after event1 we can choose event4; this loop can repeat forever and never produce event6.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from each possible immediate successor state, event2 is guaranteed to eventually occur.

- Initially we are at event1. The next state(s) (possible immediate successors) are event3, event4, or event5 (because ""After event1, either event3, event4, or event5 must happen"").

- We must check whether from each of those successors event2 is inevitable. It suffices to find one successor from which there exists a path that never reaches event2 to show C2 is false.

- From event3, allowed next events are {event2, event4, event6}. If we avoid event2, we can pick event4. From event4, allowed next are {event1, event2, event6}; again avoid event2 by picking event1. From event1 we can go to event3. Thus there is a cycle 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 ... that never visits event2. Starting from the next state event3, one can follow this cycle forever and thus never see event2.

- Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") does not hold from every next-state possibility, so C2 is false."

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true because event1 happened initially.
- C2 requires that event6 happens (and C1 holds). The rules allow nondeterministic choices after events, so event6 is not forced.
- Counterexample path that never reaches event6: choose the successors 2 after 1, and then 1 after 2, and repeat: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... This sequence respects the rules (after 1 you may pick 2; after 2 you may pick 1) and never includes event6.
- Because there exists a valid run where event6 never occurs, event6 is not guaranteed, so the conjunction in C2 is not necessarily true.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning
- The system starts with event4.
- After event4, event7 must happen. After event7, one of {event2, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- From these rules we can construct executions that never include event6. For example:
  - 4 -> 7 -> 4 -> 7 -> 4 ... (event4 forces 7, 7 can lead back to 4), so event6 never occurs.
  - Or 4 -> 7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> ... (a cycle among {2,1,3}) with no requirement to ever do event6.
- There is no rule forcing event6 to occur at any point, so C1 is not guaranteed in all executions.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says “event7 eventually happens” (i.e., from the current state, 7 will occur at some future point).
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state — i.e., after the initial transition (from event3 to one of its successors), event7 will eventually happen from that successor.
- From the initial event3 the next state could be event1, event2, or event4.
- Consider the successor event1. Transitions allow 1 -> 2 and 2 -> 1, so the system can cycle 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... indefinitely without ever taking the branch to event7. Thus from event1, event7 is not guaranteed to eventually occur.
- Because there exists a next state (e.g. event1) from which C1 can be falsified, C2 is not true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happened, so the immediate next state must follow the ""after event7, event3 must happen"" rule. Therefore the next state is event3.
- C1 asserts ""Event6 happens in the next state"" (i.e., from the initial state). That is false because the next state is event3, not event6.
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning in the next state (which is event3) C1 is true, i.e. from event3 the following state must be event6. From event3 the next state can be event4, event6, or event7; event6 is possible but not forced. So C1 does not necessarily hold in that next state.
- Therefore C2 is not true (it is false)."

From the rules:

Consider the infinite sequence that repeatedly chooses e1 -> e6 -> e4 -> e1 -> e6 -> e4 -> ...

- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 asserts: ""Event4 happens and event6 happens.""
So C2 requires that event3, event4, and event6 all occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event4 happens (given).
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event5} must happen (a choice).
- After event1, one of {event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event2, one of {event3, event4} must happen.
- After event5, one of {event4, event6} must happen.
- After event3, one of {event2, event5, event6} must happen.
- After event6, one of {event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event7, event5 must happen.
(Several rules are repeated but the choices remain the same.)

Step 3 — can C2 be forced by the rules?
- From event4 we may choose event1 next. From event1 we may choose event4 next. That gives the cycle: event4 → event1 → event4 → ...
- This allowed cycle never produces event3 or event6.
- Because the rules allow such choices, event3 and event6 are not guaranteed to occur in every possible sequence.

- C2 is not entailed by the premises (it is not guaranteed). Therefore the correct answer is:

- C2 requires C1 to hold and event6 to happen. Even if we pick the branch where the next state is event4, event6 is not forced immediately: after event4 the next event may be event1, event3, or event6. So event6 could happen later but is not guaranteed.

- C1 = (event5 happens) AND (event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event5 happens). Logically, C2 is equivalent to (event5 happens) (because (P and Q) or P ≡ P).

Step 2 — examine the rules (summary)
- Initially: event6.
- 6 -> {2, 7}
- 7 -> {2, 3, 6}
- 3 -> {1, 6}
- 2 -> 5
- 5 -> {1,4,6,7}
- 1 -> {2,4,6,7}
- 4 -> {1,2,5}

Step 3 — can event5 be avoided?
Yes. From the start 6 take 6 -> 7, then 7 -> 3, then 3 -> 6, and repeat (6 → 7 → 3 → 6 → ...). All transitions are allowed, and this infinite cycle never produces event5. Thus event5 is not guaranteed.

Step 4 — conclusion
Since C2 is equivalent to “event5 happens” and there is a valid run (6 → 7 → 3 → 6 → ...) that never contains event5, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

- From event2 you can choose {1,3,5,6}. Although 5 can be chosen (giving a path 4 → 2 → 5 → 7), it is not forced.
- There is a cycle that avoids 5 and 7: 2 → 6 → 4 → 2 → ... (6 → 4 and 4 → 2 are mandatory). This infinite run never visits 5 or 7.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event7 happens."" (a universal implication about what follows event2)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C1 is true in the state immediately following the initial state.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- Crucial rule: ""After event2, event5 must happen."" That means event2 implies the next event is event5 (not event7).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 claims that whenever event2 happens, event7 happens. But the rules force that after event2 the next event is event5, so event7 is not guaranteed after event2. Therefore C1 is false.

- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate next state event6 does not occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to the next state
- Initially event7 happened.
- Rule: After event7, either event1 or event6 must happen. So the next state must be event1 or event6.

Step 3 — reason about whether C1 must hold in the next state
- Because the rule allows event6 to occur next (it is one of the required options), it is possible for event6 to happen in the next state.
- Therefore it is not guaranteed that event6 does not happen in the next state.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed) by the given information. Counterexample: choose event6 as the next event; then C1 fails in the next state.

</graphml>",0.0,"We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 says ""Event6 always happens."" So C2 claims that in every possible sequence of events (starting from the initial event5) event6 will occur.

From the rules (condensed):
- Start: 5
- 5 -> {1,4,7}
- 4 -> {1}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,6}
- 2 -> {3,5,7}
- 3 -> {1,4,5,6,7}
- 7 -> {2,4,5}
- 6 -> {2,4}

We can exhibit a valid infinite sequence that never contains event6, showing event6 is not inevitable. For example:
5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...
- 5 -> 4 is allowed.
- 4 -> 1 is required.
- 1 -> 2 is allowed.
- 2 -> 3 is allowed.
- 3 -> 1 is allowed.
This yields the cycle 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 repeating forever and never visits 6.

Therefore C1 (""Event6 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initial fact: event2 happens.
- From event2 the allowed next events are {4,5,6,7}. So after event2, event4 may happen, but it is not forced — there are multiple possible continuations.
- Because event4 is an allowed continuation, one valid sequence is: event2 → event4. In that sequence event4 does happen, so C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false, and thus C2 is false in that sequence.
- Since the rules permit at least one sequence where C2 is false, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. (For completeness: there are also sequences where event4 never occurs and event3 does occur, e.g. event2 → event6 → event3, so C2 is possible but not entailed.)

Conclusion: C2 is not logically guaranteed by the context. Final answer: False."

- C2: C1 does not hold. We must decide whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- The very first sentence says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has already occurred at the initial time.
- Also, the rules provide transitions that allow cycles (e.g. after event1 → event3 or event6; after event3 → event5 is allowed; after event5 → event1).

Step 3 — reason about ""eventually happens"":
- Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 (event1 eventually happens) is satisfied immediately.
- Even if one interprets ""eventually"" to mean at some future time after the initial moment, the transition sequence event1 → event3 → event5 → event1 is allowed by the rules, so event1 will occur again.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 occurred, so the next-state choices are event1, event3, or event4.
- Take the successor event1. From event1 you can go to event3; from event3 you can go back to event1. Thus there is a possible infinite run 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... that never visits event2.
- That provides a continuation from the next state in which event2 never occurs, so ""event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed to hold in the next state.

- C1: ""Event1 happens or event6 happens"" (in a state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state after the initial state).
We must decide whether C2 is necessarily true given the rules and the initial event.

Step 2 — relevant rule from the context
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule for event3: ""After event3, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen.""

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- The next state after the initial event3 must be one of {event1, event4, event6, event7}.
- C1 requires the next event to be event1 or event6. But the next event could instead be event4 or event7.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happens.
- From event5 you may choose event4 (since after event5 the next is either 4 or 6).
- From event4 you may choose event1 (since after event4 the next is 1,3,6, or7).
- From event1 you may choose event2 (since after event1 the next is 2,3,4, or6).
- From event2 you may choose event1 (since after event2 the next is 1,4, or7).

Thus you can follow the cycle 5 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... indefinitely without ever selecting event6. Therefore event6 does not have to happen, so C1 (event6 does not happen) can hold, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. event6 happens) is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False."

- From 5 choose 1.
- Repeat 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → … forever.

This infinite run never contains event3 or event6, so the antecedent (event1 occurs) holds but the consequent (event3 or event6 occurs) does not. Therefore the implication is not guaranteed by the rules.

1) Identify initial condition: Initially event2 happened.
2) Examine the rule for event2: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So the execution stops immediately after the initial event2 — there are no further events in any possible sequence.
3) Evaluate C1 in that execution: Since the only event that occurred is event2, neither event3 nor event4 happens. Therefore C1 is false in the actual (and only) execution.
4) C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Because we have an execution where C1 is false, C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happens.
- After event6 the next event must be one of {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}.
  - If it is event1 or event2, then C2 is immediately satisfied (C2 = event1 or event2 or event3).
  - If it is event4, then by the rules event3 must happen next → event3 occurs, so C2 is satisfied.
  - If it is event5, the next event must be in {1, 2, 7}:
    - If that next event is 1 or 2, C2 is satisfied.
    - If it is 7, then after event7 the next event must be in {1, 2}, so again C2 is satisfied.
  - If it is event7 (directly after 6), then the next event is in {1, 2} and C2 is satisfied.

All possible branches from the initial event6 lead to at least one of event1, event2, or event3 occurring, so C2 must hold."
