Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the statement ""Event7 does not happen"" — interpreted as a state formula (i.e., event7 is not true in the current state).
2. The initial state is ""event4 happened"", so event7 is not happening in the initial state. Thus C1 holds in the initial state.
3. C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 already holds in the initial state, C2 holds immediately (regardless of event2).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event3 happens and Event5 happens"" — this requires both event3 and event5 to hold in the same state.
2. The model describes states by which single event happened at that state; exactly one event holds in any given state.
3. Therefore it is impossible for event3 and event5 to be true simultaneously in one state, so C1 cannot hold.

- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state, event4 does not happen).

Given context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event7 must happen.

Reasoning:
1. The initial state has event4 = true.
2. The transition rule for event4 requires the next state to be either event1 or event7.
3. Therefore the next state cannot be event4.

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens in the next state.""  
2. C2 is ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" — equivalently: after event7, event3 must happen (in the immediate next state).  
3. The context gives the allowed immediate successors after event7: either event1, event2, or event4 must happen. Event3 is not listed as a required/allowed immediate successor of event7.  
4. Therefore the context does not force that event3 occurs immediately after event7; the next state after event7 can be event1, event2, or event4 instead.  
5. Hence C2 (""after event7, event3 must happen"") is not entailed by the context.

Reasoning:
- C1 (Event6 always happens) cannot hold: the initial state is event6, but the rules after event6 force the next event to be event3 or event7 (neither is event6), so event6 cannot hold in all future states.
- Since C1 is false in the actual trace, the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is vacuously true."

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 means ""the next state is event6"", which can only happen after a current event7 (since only after event7 may event6 occur).
- From the initial event3 we can reach event7 (e.g. 3 -> 4 -> 7, since after 3 can go to 4 and after 4 can go to 7).
- At that state (current = event7) it is possible to take the transition to event6, so C1 can hold while the current event is event7.
- But event1 does not hold in that state (current = event7 ≠ event1), so the implication (C1 ⇒ event1) is violated.
Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The system starts with event3 in the initial state.
2. The context says: after event3, no other events can happen — so the initial state is terminal and no future events occur.
3. Therefore event2 never occurs on any path from the initial state.
4. C2 is the implication ""if event2 happens, then event4 eventually happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
5. Because event2 cannot happen in this model, C2 is true.

(For completeness: if one hypothetically allowed event2 to occur, there are transitions event2 → (event4 or event7) and event7 → (event2 or event3). A path event2 → event7 → event3 would terminate without event4, so if event2 were reachable the implication would not be guaranteed. But under the given initial conditions it is vacuously true.)"

1. C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state."" That means the current state has a transition whose chosen next event is event2.
2. Which current events can have event2 as a next event? From the context, event3, event5, and event4 have event2 among their allowed next events (after event3 → {2,6}; after event5 → {1,2,4,6}; after event4 → {2,3,5,7}).
3. C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e., whenever the next state is event2, the current state must be event1.
4. That claim is false because there are reachable states where the next event can be event2 while the current event is not event1. For example, the initial state is event7, and after event7 event4 must happen. At state event4, a next event2 is allowed (after event4 includes 2). So at that state C1 can hold (next = event2) while the current event is event4 (not event1).
5. Therefore the implication in C2 does not hold in general.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the conjunction ""Event7 happens and event5 happens"" — interpreted as both events holding in the same state.
2. In this model exactly one event holds in each state (events are mutually exclusive), so no single state can have both event7 and event5 true together.

1. Interpret C1: ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens."" In a single state this implication is true whenever event2 is false in that state (because events are mutually exclusive: at each state exactly one event holds), so C1 is false only in states where event2 is true and event4 is false — which cannot be a state with both true simultaneously. Thus C1 holds in any state whose current event is not event2.

2. The initial state has event6 happened. Therefore event2 is false in the initial state, so C1 holds at the initial state.

3. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial state, C2 is satisfied (there exists a future state — the initial one — where C1 holds).

2. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (the immediate successor of the initial state).

1. C1 asserts: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
2. The context states: ""Initially, event5 happened."" So we consider transitions out of event5.
3. The context also states: ""After event5, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen."" So the next state must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
4. Event3 is not among the allowed next events from event5, so event3 cannot happen in the next state.
5. Therefore C1 is false.

1. C1 is the state formula (event7 → event4). In a model where exactly one event holds in each state, this implication is false only in states where event7 holds (because then event4 is different and false). So C1 is true in any state that is not event7 — equivalently C1 ≡ (not event7).

2. The initial state is event5 (given in the context). In that initial state event7 is false, so C1 holds immediately.

2. In this system a single state denotes exactly one event happening; you cannot have two different events true simultaneously in one state.
3. Therefore no state can make Event6 and Event7 both true at the same time, so C1 is always false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 asserts ""event3 AND event4"" hold in the same state (as in the provided examples, only one event occurs per state).
2. The context starts with event3 in the initial state; no rule makes event4 true simultaneously with event3 in that same state.
3. All transition rules specify a single next event choice after each event; none allow a state where both event3 and event4 are true together.
4. Therefore C1 is never satisfied in any state.
5. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is true."

1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. The context repeatedly states: ""After event1, either event6, or event7 must happen.""
3. Therefore the immediate next state after the initial state must be either event6 or event7.
4. C1 asserts: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" That conflicts with step 3 — event4 cannot be the next state.

1. C1 is ""Event6 does not happen.""  
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, event6 does not happen.  
3. The context says: ""Initially, event6 happened."" So we look at the next state after that initial event6.  
4. The context also says (multiple times) ""After event6, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen."" No rule allows event6 to follow itself.  
5. Therefore the next state after the initial event6 must be one of event1, event2, or event3 — in particular, it cannot be event6.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every future state).
2. C2 is the implication ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""
3. From the context: after event1, event2 may happen; after event2, the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event4, event5, event6} — notably event2 is not allowed immediately after event2.
4. Starting from the initial event3, we can follow a valid trace: event3 -> event1 -> event2 -> event1. In this trace event2 does happen (at the third state), but the very next state is event1 (not event2).
5. Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false on that trace (event2 does not hold at the next state), so the implication in C2 is violated at the state where event2 holds.
6. Hence C2 is not entailed by the context.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. In this formalism each state selects exactly one event (as in the provided examples). There are no rules that make two different events true in the same state.  
2. C1 is the conjunction ""Event4 happens and Event6 happens"" (i.e., both true in the same state). Given (1), that conjunction is impossible — C1 is always false.

1. From the context: initially event3 happens.
2. From event3, one possible next event is event1 (since after event3 -> {1,2,5,7}).
3. From event1, one possible next event is event2 (after event1 -> {2,3}).
4. From event2, one possible next event is event1 (after event2 -> {1,4,5,7}).
5. Thus there is a valid infinite run: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that cycles between event1 and event2 forever.
6. Along this run C1 holds (since event1 or event2 occurs), but event6 never occurs.
7. Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event6 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Reasoning:
1. C1 is ""Event4 and Event5 both hold in the same state.""
2. C2 is ""If Event5 holds, then C1 holds"" — i.e. whenever a state has Event5 true, that state must also have Event4 true.
3. From the context: initially Event6 holds, and after Event6 one possible next event is Event5. So there is a reachable state where Event5 holds.
4. In any single state exactly one event holds, so in a state where Event5 holds, Event4 does not hold. Therefore C1 is false in that state.
5. That gives a reachable state where the antecedent of C2 (Event5) is true but the consequent (C1) is false, so C2 is false."

2. C2 is: C1 holds OR event5 happens.
3. C1 is: event6 happens in the next state.
4. The context says: initially event5 happened. So event5 is true in the initial state.
5. Since event5 is true now, the disjunction C2 (C1 OR event5) is true regardless of C1.
6. (For completeness: after event5 the next state must be event2 or event3, so C1 is actually false — but that doesn't affect C2 because event5 already makes C2 true.)

Reasoning:
- C2 asserts: ""If event7 happens, then event2 happens in the next state.""
- The context rule for event7 is: after event7, either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- That allows successors other than event2 (for example event1), so event2 is not guaranteed after every occurrence of event7.
- Therefore the implication is not ensured by the context, so C2 is False."

1. C1 is the state formula: If event7 happens then event4 happens (i.e., event7 -> event4 in the same state). Since at most one event holds per state, C1 is false in any state where event7 holds (because event4 cannot also hold there), and true in any state where event7 does not hold (vacuously).

2. Initially event7 happened, so C1 is false in the initial state. But C2 is the claim ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1 is true in the immediate successor state).

3. The transition rule after event7 requires the next event to be one of {event1, event3, event5}. In any of those successor states event7 is false, so the implication event7 -> event4 is true vacuously.

4. Therefore in every possible next state C1 is true, so C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is True.

1. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Interpreting as in the examples, this requires a single state where both event1 and event2 are true simultaneously.  
2. The context describes a single event occurring in each state (states are labeled by which event happened). Thus two different events cannot be true in the same state.  
3. Although the system can visit event1 at one time and later event2 (e.g. event7 → event6 → event1 → event2 is a possible sequence), that does not make them true simultaneously in one state.  
4. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event1 occurs. From event1, event6 is one permitted next event.
- From event6, event5 is one permitted next event.
- So there is a reachable run: event1 -> event6 -> event5. In that run event6 happens and event5 does happen afterward.
- C1 is ""event5 does not happen"" — this is false in that run.

1. C2 states: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event5 happens in the next state."" So C2 requires that whenever event1 occurs, the following state must be event5.
2. From the context: ""After event1, either event3, event4, or event6 must happen."" That means the next state after event1 must be one of {event3, event4, event6}.
3. None of those allowed next events is event5, so after event1 the next state cannot be event5.
4. Event1 is reachable (initially event3, and after event3 event1 may happen), so the implication is not vacuously true.

- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state"" (i.e., next(event5)).
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — formally: event3 → next(event5).

From the context:
- After event3, event1 must happen (the next state after event3 is event1).
- After event1, event5 must happen (but that is one more step later).

So if event3 occurs in a state, the immediate next state is event1, not event5. Therefore next(event5) is false in that case, making the implication event3 → next(event5) false.

1. Interpret C1 as a state-level implication: C1 = (event6 → event1) — i.e., in any given state, C1 is true iff either event6 is false or event1 is true.

2. In the initial state event6 holds and event1 does not, so C1 is false in that state. (That doesn't yet decide C2.)

3. C2 is (event7 → C1). That is true in any state where either event7 is false, or C1 is true.

4. In any state where event7 happens, event6 cannot also happen at the same time (exactly one event holds per state). So in any event7 state, event6 is false, hence the implication event6 → event1 (C1) is vacuously true in that state.

5. Therefore, whenever event7 occurs, C1 holds in that state; and in states without event7 the implication event7 → C1 is trivially true.

Conclusion: C2 holds in all states reachable from the context, so C2 is True.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event3 holds, and the context says ""After event3, no other events can happen."" So the system remains at event3 forever.
- Event7 therefore never occurs in any reachable state.
- The implication ""if event7 happens then event5 happens"" is vacuously true in every reachable state (antecedent never holds).

Reasoning:
1. C2 states: ""If event3 happens now, then event3 happens in the next state"" (event3 -> next event3).
2. The context explicitly says ""After event3, event1 must happen."" That forces the next state to be event1, so next event3 is false whenever event3 happens now.
3. Since event3 can occur (e.g., from the initial event1, event3 is an allowed next event), there are reachable states where event3 holds now but not in the next state, making the implication false.

- C1 is ""Event7 happens or event7 happens"", i.e., simply ""Event7 happens"".
- C2 is ""Event7 eventually holds"" (i.e., on every path from the initial state, event7 occurs at some future step).

Step 2 — follow transitions from the initial state:
- Initially event6 happened.
- After event6, the next event must be either event5 or event7.
  - If it is event7, C1 already holds immediately (so C2 is satisfied).
  - If it is event5, then after event5 event1 must happen, and after event1 event7 must happen. So any path that goes 6 → 5 → 1 → 7 reaches event7.

There is no alternative loop or branch from the initial state that can avoid reaching event7: both allowed choices from event6 (5 or 7) lead to event7 in a finite number of steps.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event3 holds.
2. From event3, a next event can be event5 (after event3, one option is event5).
3. From event5, a next event can be event2 (after event5, event2 is one allowed successor).
4. Therefore there is a reachable state where event2 holds.
5. At a state where event2 holds, neither event1 nor event3 holds (exactly one event holds per state).
6. C1 is ""event1 or event3"", which is false in that event2 state.
7. Hence the implication ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is falsified by this reachable state.

1. C1 says: ""Event2 happens or event6 happens.""
2. The context states: ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, either event4, event5, event6, or event7 must happen.""
3. From the initial state (event1), a next state with event6 is allowed (in fact, event6 is one of the mandatory options).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the statement: ""If event6 happens, then event5 happens in the next state.""
2. From the context: after event6, either event1 or event4 must happen (no option for event5).
3. Event6 can occur from the initial situation: initially event7, then choose event3 (allowed after 7), then choose event6 (allowed after 3). So a trace 7 → 3 → 6 is possible.
4. From that event6 state, the next state must be event1 or event4, not event5, so C1 (event5 in the next state) can be false after event6.
5. Therefore the implication ""if event6 happens then event5 happens next"" is not guaranteed and C2 is False."

1. C1 is the formula: event5 -> event1 (if event5 happens then event1 happens).
2. C2 is the formula: event1 -> C1, i.e. event1 -> (event5 -> event1).
3. If event1 is true in a state, then the consequent (event5 -> event1) is automatically true in that state because event1 (the consequent of the inner implication) is true. Thus whenever event1 holds, C1 holds.
4. In particular the initial state has event1 true, so C2 holds there. More generally C2 is true in every state (vacuously when event1 is false, directly as shown when event1 is true).

1. C1 is the proposition ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" As a state formula, this is equivalent to (not event2) OR event5 — so C1 is true in any state that is not event2, and false only in states where event2 holds (because events are mutually exclusive in a state).

2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e., there exists a current or future state where C1 is true.

3. The initial state is event7. In that state event2 is false, so C1 is true there (the implication is vacuously satisfied).

4. Since C1 holds already at the initial state, C1 eventually holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
2. C1 is ""Event5 happens and event3 happens"" — i.e., both event5 and event3 are true in the same state.
3. The context describes a system where each state is labeled by a single event and transitions move to one of the listed next events (e.g., from event5 the next state must be event2 or event4, from event3 the next state must be event4 or event5, etc.). As in the provided examples, events are mutually exclusive in a single state.
4. Therefore there is no state in which event5 and event3 are both true simultaneously, so C1 is never true (C1 is always false).
5. An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Hence C2 is true."

1. C2 states: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"", where C1 = ""event5 happens in the next state"".
2. From the context, initially event5 happens. After event5, event3 or event6 must happen. So a possible next choice is event3.
3. After event3, event2, event4, or event7 must happen. Thus event4 is reachable via the path: event5 -> event3 -> event4.
4. After event4, the allowed next events are event1, event2, or event3 (no event5 option).
5. Therefore at a reachable state where event4 happens, the next state cannot be event5, so C1 is false there.
6. Since there exists a reachable state where event4 holds but C1 does not, the implication in C2 is false.

Reasoning (brief):
- C2 says: whenever event4 happens (in a state), then event6 or event3 holds in that same state.
- From the context, starting at event7 we can go event7 -> event1 -> event4 (after event7 choose event1; after event1 choose event4), so a state with event4 is reachable.
- In a state labelled event4, neither event3 nor event6 holds (the state is event4).
- Thus the implication (event4 → (event6 or event3)) is false in that reachable state."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 says: if event2 happens, then event6 always happens (C1).
2. From the context, starting at the initial state event3, event2 can occur next (after event3 one option is event2).
3. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, one possible choice is event3. After event3, one possible choice is event2. Thus there is a reachable cycle: ... -> event2 -> event1 -> event3 -> event2 -> ...
4. That cycle never visits event6, so on that run event2 occurs but event6 does not ""always happen.""
5. Therefore there exists a run where the antecedent (event2 happens) is true but the consequent (event6 always happens) is false, so the implication C2 is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the claim: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" where C1 is ""event5 and event4"" (both true in the same state).
2. From the context: initially event5 happens, and after event5 one possible next state is event3. So there is a reachable state where event3 holds.
3. C1 requires event5 and event4 to be true simultaneously in a single state. In this model states correspond to a single event occurring, so you cannot have event5 and event4 both true in the same state.
4. Therefore, in the reachable state where event3 holds, C1 is false, so the implication ""if event3 then C1"" is false there.

1. C1 is the proposition ""event3 does not happen"" — interpreted as ""event3 is false in the current state.""
2. C2 is the implication ""if event4 happens (in the current state), then C1 holds"" i.e. event4 ⇒ (not event3) in the same state.
3. By the model's state semantics, at any single state exactly one event holds; if event4 holds then event3 cannot hold in that same state.
4. The initial state has event4 true and event3 false, so the antecedent and consequent of the implication are true there.
5. Therefore the implication (C2) is true (it holds in the initial state). Note that although a subsequent state after event4 could be event3, that does not affect the truth of the current-state implication.

1. Interpret C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — this is a same-state implication: whenever a state has event2, that state must also have C1 (event6 or event3).  
2. By the model (as in the examples), only one event can be true in any single state. So in a state where event2 holds, event3 and event6 cannot hold simultaneously. Thus any state with event2 makes the implication false.  
3. From the initial state (event7), after event7 one allowed next event is event2, so a state with event2 is reachable.  
4. Therefore there exists a reachable state where event2 holds but C1 does not, so C2 is false.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event4 occurs. From event4 the system can go to event5 or event7.
- If we pick event5, then by the rules we may go event5 → event3.
- From event3 the only allowed next is event7, and from event7 we may go back to event3. So there is a reachable infinite loop: ... → event5 → event3 → event7 → event3 → event7 → ...
- Along that trace C1 (event3 or event5) does hold at many states, yet event2 never occurs.
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed; C2 is False."

1. C1 is the proposition (event7 → event5). In a single state this implication is true whenever event7 is false (or when both event7 and event5 are true, but two different events cannot hold simultaneously).
2. The initial state is event6 (so event7 is false in the initial state).
3. Therefore C1 is true in the initial state (because the antecedent event7 is false).
4. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"". Since C1 already holds at the initial state, C1 does eventually hold.

Reasoning:
- C1 is the conjunction ""Event7 happens and Event6 happens"" (i.e., both hold in the same state).
- In this transition system a state corresponds to a single event occurrence, so two different events cannot be true simultaneously in one state.
- Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event6 happens and event2 happens"" — interpreted as both events being true in the same state (same semantics as the provided examples).
2. In this model each state records a single event occurrence and transitions specify the single next event; two different events cannot be true simultaneously in one state.
3. Therefore C1 can never be true in any single state (event6 and event2 cannot hold together).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., from that point onward every state has event2).
2. To satisfy C1 at any point, you would need event2 to occur in the current state and in every subsequent state.
3. The transition rule after event2 is: next event must be one of {event1, event3, event6}. Event2 is not allowed after event2.
4. Therefore you can never have two consecutive states with event2, and so you cannot have a state after which every future state is event2.
5. Hence C1 can never hold at any reachable point, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

1. Initial event is event4.
2. From event4 the allowed next events are {event2, event6, event7}.
3. From event7 the allowed next events are {event3, event4}.
4. Therefore one possible infinite execution is: 4 → 7 → 4 → 7 → ... repeating.
5. In that trace neither event5 nor event2 ever occurs (it visits only events 4 and 7).
6. C1 (""Event5 does not happen"") holds on that trace, but event2 does not happen.
7. Hence the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed by the context.

1. C1 = ""event6 eventually happens"" (F event6).
2. C2 = ""C1 holds or event6 happens now"" = (F event6) OR event6(now). Since event6(now) implies F event6, C2 is equivalent to F event6 (i.e., equivalent to C1).
3. Check whether event6 must eventually happen from the initial state. Initially event7 happened.
4. From event7 one possible next is event3; from event3 the next must be event5; from event5 one possible next is event7. So there is a valid cycle 7 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 that never visits event6.
5. Therefore there exists a valid infinite trace starting at the initial state that never reaches event6, so ""event6 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed.
6. Hence C1 is false at the initial state, and so is C2.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event5 always happens"" (G event5): this requires a state from which every future state is event5.
2. From the context: after event5 the next event must be either event1 or event4 (no transition from event5 to event5).
3. Therefore no state labeled event5 can have all future states be event5 (the very next state after any event5 is not event5).
4. Hence C1 is never true in any state, so C2 (""eventually C1 holds"", i.e. F G event5) cannot become true.

Reasoning:
- States are labeled by a single event; transitions are given. C1 is the state formula ""event5 -> event6"" and C2 says C1 holds in every reachable state.
- From the initial event4 we can go 4 -> 1 -> 5, so a state with event5 is reachable.
- In any single state only one event holds, so in that state event6 does not hold, making C1 false there.
- Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False."

4. C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not happen in the next state). For C2 to be true it would have to be impossible for event3 to be the next state.

3. After event5, one allowed successor is event3 (choices are event1, event2, event3, or event4).

5. So there is a valid run: event2 -> event5 -> event3 (and then stop). In this run C1 holds (event5 occurs), but event6 never occurs.

1. Initial state: event1 is true (and event6 is not true).
2. C2 is (C1) OR (event6 now). Since event6 is false in the initial state, C2 would need C1 to hold in the initial state.
3. C1 is ""event5 happens in the next state.""
4. From event1 the next state may be event2, event3, or event5 (nondeterministically).
5. Because the next state could be event2 or event3, event5 is not guaranteed in the next state, so C1 does not necessarily hold in the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says: in any state, if event3 holds then event2 holds in that same state (event3 -> event2).
2. Only one event can hold in a given state, so event3 and event2 cannot be true simultaneously in one state.
3. From the context: initially event7, then event2 must occur, and after event2 we may choose event3. Thus there is a reachable state where event3 holds (and event2 does not hold in that same state).
4. That reachable state is a counterexample to C1, so C1 is false.

4. Therefore event1 can happen immediately, so C1 holds at the initial state.
5. If C1 already holds now, then ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true.

2. C2 is ""if event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — equivalently, whenever event3 is true in a state, event2 must also be true in that same state (since C1 includes event3 already).
3. The context says ""Initially, event3 happened."" So in the initial state event3 is true.
4. From the context, after event3, event7 must happen; nothing in the context makes event2 true in the same state as event3. These event descriptions are state labels (one event per state), so event2 and event3 cannot be true simultaneously in a state.
5. Therefore in the initial state event3 is true but event2 is not, so C1 is false in that state.

1. C1 says ""Event4 always happens"" — i.e., in every state/event occurrence, event4 must be the active event.  
2. The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" So the initial state has event3 true (and not event4).  
3. Therefore C1 is false in the initial state (event4 does not happen there).  
4. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 cannot be true.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""event6 happens and event5 happens"" (both in the same state).

Step 2 — interpretation used (as in the examples):
- Each state corresponds to exactly one event happening; the ""after eventX, either ..."" clauses select the single next event. Thus two different events cannot be true simultaneously in the same state.

Step 3 — apply to C1:
- C1 requires event6 and event5 to be true in the same single state. That is impossible under the model (only one event per state).

Step 4 — reachability doesn't help:
- Although sequences can include both event6 and event5 at different times (e.g. 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 and earlier or later a 6 could occur), they never occur simultaneously in one state, so C1 can never hold in any state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says: if event2 happens (in a state), then event5 happens (in that same state). Because exactly one event holds per state, any state where event2 holds does not have event5 holding simultaneously; so C1 would require that no state with event2 is ever reachable, otherwise C1 is false.
2. From the context: initially event3. After event3 -> event7. From event7 -> either event3 or event5.
3. From event5 -> one possible next is event2. Thus there is a reachable sequence: event3 → event7 → event5 → event2. So a state where event2 happens is reachable.
4. In that state event5 does not hold, so the implication ""if event2 then event5"" is false there. Hence C1 does not hold.
5. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

1. C1 = (event5 AND event4) — it requires event5 and event4 to be true in the same state.  
2. Initially event4 happened. After event4, event3 must happen — so the immediate next state is event3.  
3. C2 asserts that C1 holds in that next state (i.e., in the state after the initial state). In that next state the event that holds is event3 (not event4 or event5).  
4. Moreover, events are mutually exclusive in a single state, so no state can have both event4 and event5 true simultaneously; therefore C1 can never be true in any single state.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event4 happens"" — at a given state this requires event5 to be false and event4 to be true in the same state.

From the context: initially event6 happened. So in the initial state event6 is true, and all other events (including event4 and event5) are false.

- C1 is true in the initial state (event5 does not happen there).
- But event4 is false in the initial state.

Since C2 requires event4 to be true in the same state where C1 holds, C2 is false in the initial state. (There is no temporal operator in C2 requiring a later state.)

1. The initial state is event6 (given).
2. C2 is ""C1 holds AND event7 happens"", where C1 = (event5 OR event3). So C2 requires a single state where event7 is true and (event5 or event3) is also true simultaneously.
3. By the model used in the examples and the context, exactly one event holds in any given state — events are mutually exclusive in a state.
4. Therefore no single state can have event7 and event5 (or event3) true at the same time.
5. Consequently C2 cannot be true in the initial state, nor in any reachable state.

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 holds.
- The rules after event6: the next state must be one of event2, event4, or event5.
- Therefore the next state can be event2 (C1 can hold); it is not impossible.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state). Since event2 is a permitted next state, C2 is not guaranteed.

2. C2 is the conjunction: C1 holds AND event1 happens — i.e., in the same state we must have event1 true and the implication (event4 → event2) true. If event1 is true in a state, event4 is false there, so C1 is vacuously true in that state; thus C2 is equivalent to ""event1 is true in that state.""

3. The question asks whether C2 is true (interpreted at the initial state as in the examples). The initial state is event6, not event1.

4. Therefore C2 is false in the initial state. (Note: there are transitions from event6 that can lead to event1 in the next state, so C2 can become true later, but as stated C2 is not true initially.)

Final answer: False"

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Interpret C1 as a state-level implication: in any state, if event2 holds then event5 holds (i.e., event2 and event5 would have to be true in the same state).
2. Only one event holds in a given state, so event2 and event5 cannot be true simultaneously in a single state.
3. From the context: initially event1 holds, and after event1 one possible next state is event2 (the choice includes event2).
4. Therefore there exists a reachable state where event2 holds and event5 does not hold, so C1 is false.
5. C2 states ""C1 does not hold"", which is therefore true."

- C2 is the disjunction ""Event6 happens or C1 holds."" Even if ""Event6 happens"" is interpreted as ""event6 occurs eventually,"" it is not guaranteed: from the initial event3 there is a cycle avoiding event6 (for example 3 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → ...), so a run exists with no event6.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 asks whether eventually there is a time from which C1 (""Event1 always happens"") holds forever.
2. For C1 to hold at some time t, every state at and after t must have event1 true — i.e., the system must be stuck in event1 only.
3. Check the transition rules: after event1, the next event can be event3, event5, or event7. No rule forces event1 to follow event1, and no event has the sole successor event1.
4. The only absorbing/terminal event is event6 (it stays event6 forever), not event1.
5. Therefore there is no reachable state from which only event1 can occur forever; C1 never becomes true at any time.
6. Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is False."

1. C1 is ""Event4 does not happen.""
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, event4 does not happen.
3. The context says: Initially, event1 happened. After event1, either event2, event4, event6, or event7 must happen.
4. Therefore from the initial state there is a permitted next state in which event4 happens.
5. Since a next state where event4 happens is allowed, it is not guaranteed that in the next state event4 does not happen.
6. Thus C2 (that event4 does not happen in the next state) is not entailed by the context.

1. C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""  
2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state, the next state must be event5.

From the context: initially event7 happened. The allowed successors after event7 are {event1, event2, event3, event4} (event5 is not among them).

Therefore at the initial state C1 is false (the next state cannot be event5). Since C1 does not hold at least at the initial state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

1. Initially event4 happened. So the current state is event4.  
2. C2 asserts: ""C1 holds in the next state."" So we must check the immediate successor(s) of event4.  
3. From the context: ""After event4, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen."" Thus the next state is one of event1, event2, or event5.  
4. C1 is ""event4 happens or event6 happens."" None of event1, event2, or event5 satisfy C1 (they are not event4 or event6).

- From the context, transitions are:

  - 1 -> {2,7}

  - 4 -> {1,3}
  - 6 -> {3}

- Initially we are in event3.
- From 3 we can choose 2; from 2 we can choose 6; from 6 we must go to 3. That gives the cycle 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3.
- That cycle contains no event1, and it can be repeated forever, producing an infinite path with no occurrence of event1.
- Therefore ""Event1 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed at the initial state (there exists a path where it never happens).
- Hence C1 does not hold at all states, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

1. C1 is ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., event7 holds in every state from the initial state onward).
2. The initial state is event1. Therefore event7 does not hold in the initial state.

4. C2 is ""Event4 happens and C1 holds"". Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true (conjunction false).
5. (Also, event4 does not hold in the initial state either, so C2 is false at the initial state.)

1. Initially event4 happened.
2. After event4, the next event must be either event2 or event5 (this rule appears twice but is the same choice).
3. So there is a reachable state where event2 happens (choose that branch).
4. In any single state only one event happens at a time, so when event2 happens, event1 does not happen in that state — i.e., C1 (event1 does not happen) holds there.
5. Therefore there exists a state where event2 happens and C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event7 happened (the initial state is event7).
2. C1 is the conjunction ""event5 and event7"" — it requires both event5 and event7 to hold in the same state.
3. In the initial state event7 holds but event5 does not, so C1 is false in the initial state.
4. C2 asserts that C1 always holds (in every state). Because C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 cannot be true.

Step 3 — check reachability (can C2 be forced later?):
- From event4 one possible next event is event3 (since after event4, event3 is allowed).
- From event3 a next event can be event4.

Reasoning:
1. C2 = (C1) OR (event4 happens). C1 = ""event3 always happens"" (i.e., event3 holds in the current state and all future states).
2. Initially event6 happened, so event3 is not true in the initial state. Therefore C1 is false (an ""always"" claim that includes the current state cannot hold if the current state already violates it).
3. Event4 does not hold in the initial state (the initial event is event6, not event4).

2. Initial event: 6.

3. From 6 a next event must be 1 or 5. If we choose 5, then from 5 one allowed next event is 2.

4. Thus there exists a valid sequence 6 -> 5 -> 2 in which event2 occurs. Therefore C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true (there is a future where event2 occurs).

5. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 never happens). Since C1 is true, C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 means ""event6 always happens"" — i.e., from some state onward every state must have event6.
2. For C1 to ever hold (at a state), that state must be event6 and every subsequent state must also be event6.
3. But the context says: after event6, the next event must be either event1 or event3. There is no transition from event6 to event6.
4. Therefore it is impossible to have two consecutive event6 states, so C1 can never hold at any state.
5. C2 says ""eventually C1 holds"" — since C1 never holds, C2 is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the model (as in the examples), exactly one event holds in any given state.
2. Initially event4 holds.
3. The context states ""After event4, event5 must happen."" So the next state is event5.
4. The context also states ""After event5, either event1, event2, event4, event6, or event7 must happen."" So from event5 we may move to event2.
5. If we reach a state where event2 holds, then (since only one event holds) event3 does not hold in that same state — so C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is satisfied there.
6. Therefore there is a reachable state where both event2 holds and C1 holds, so C2 is satisfiable.

Reasoning:
1. Initial event is event6.
2. After event6, either event4 or event7 must happen.
3. If we choose event4, then after event4 either event2 or event5 must happen.
4. So there is a reachable sequence: event6 -> event4 -> event5, in which event5 occurs.
5. Therefore ""Event5 eventually happens"" (C1) is true (there exists a reachable future state with event5).

- C2 is the implication C1 -> (event4 happens). This is false if there exists any valid run where C1 holds but event4 never happens.
- Start at the initial event6. Choose transitions that avoid event4:
  - After event6 choose event1 (allowed).
  - After event1 choose event2 (allowed).
  - After event2 choose event3 (allowed).
  - After event3 choose event7 (allowed).
  - After event7 we must go to event6.
  - This returns to event6 and the cycle can repeat: 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> ...

- From 6, choose 6 -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> ... repeatedly. Both 6->1 and 1->6 are allowed, so this infinite loop never visits event2.

- If s1 = event1, then the following state s2 can be event2 or event5 (after event1, either event2 or event5 must happen). So s2 could be event5, in which case ""event2 happens in the next state"" (C1 at s1) is false.
- If s1 = event5, then s2 can be event2, event4, or event6; again s2 is not guaranteed to be event2.
- Because there exists an allowed choice (e.g. initial event4 → event1 → event5) where C1 does not hold at s1, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed by the context.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event4 holds.
2. C1 is the proposition ""if event4 happens, then event2 happens"" interpreted as a same-state implication: event4 -> event2.
3. In the initial state event4 is true but event2 is not, so that implication (C1) is false in the initial state.
4. C2 is C1 AND event3. Even ignoring C1, event3 is not true in the initial state, so C2 is false.
5. (Note on ambiguity: if C1 were intended to mean ""whenever event4 happens then eventually event2 happens,"" that is a different temporal claim. That temporal claim is also not guaranteed on all runs because one can loop between event4 and event5 forever, avoiding event2. So under the usual readings C2 is false.)"

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""Event5 always happens"" — this requires that from some state onward, every state in the future has event5 true (i.e., event5 holds now and at every subsequent step).

2. From the context, after event5 happens the next event must be either event1 or event7 (no transition from 5 to 5). Therefore event5 cannot hold in two consecutive states.

3. Because event5 cannot follow itself, there is no point in any run from which event5 holds at every future state. In particular, C1 is never true in any state.

4. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists a future time after which C1 holds). Since C1 can never hold, C2 is false.

- C1: ""Event6 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state, the next event is event6.

Reasoning:
1. Initially event4 happened.
2. The context says: after event4, one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6} must happen. Event6 is allowed but not the only option.
3. Therefore from the initial state a next event of event1 (or event2, event3, or event5) is possible.
4. That means C1 does not necessarily hold in the initial state (the next event need not be event6).
5. Since C1 fails in at least one possible state/run, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

1. C1 says: ""Event3 eventually happens.""  
2. From the context: initially event6. After event6 one possible next event is event7.  
3. After event7, event3 is allowed (after event7, either event1, event2, event3, or event4 must happen).  
4. Thus there is a valid execution 6 -> 7 -> 3 in which event3 does eventually occur, so C1 can hold.  
5. C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 never happens). That claim is false because we just exhibited a possible future where event3 does happen. (Although there are also executions that avoid event3, that does not make C2 true.)

Reasoning:

- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") requires every state to be event4; that fails immediately because the initial state is event7 (and there is no transition 7→7 forcing 4 everywhere). For example, 7 → 1 → 7 is a valid run with no event4, so C1 is false.

1. C1 is the proposition: ""If event6 happens, then event3 happens.""  
   Interpreting this as a state-wise implication: any state where event6 holds must also have event3 hold in that same state. (As in the examples, events are mutually exclusive in a state, so this requires that event6 never occurs, otherwise the implication is violated.)

2. Start from the initial state: event3 happened.

3. From event3 the rules allow either event1 or event5 next. So event1 is reachable.

4. From event1 the rules allow event2, event4, event6, or event7 next. Thus event6 is reachable (via 3 -> 1 -> 6).

5. There is therefore a reachable state where event6 holds. In that state event3 does not hold (events are exclusive), so the implication ""if event6 then event3"" is false.

6. Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event5 happened (so event3 is false, event4 is false in the initial state).
2. C1 is the propositional implication ""if event3 happens then event5 happens."" In the initial state event3 is false, so C1 is true there (false implies anything).
3. C2 is ""if C1 holds, then event4 happens."" In the initial state C1 holds, so C2 would require event4 to hold in the initial state.
4. But event4 does not hold in the initial state (event5 does), so the implication in C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False."

1. The system starts with a single event true in each state (e.g., ""Initially, event4 happened"" and every ""After eventX, either ... must happen"" gives a single next event). So at any state exactly one event holds.

2. C1 is ""Event6 happens and event3 happens"" — this requires event6 and event3 to be true in the same state (a simultaneous conjunction).

3. Given the model (one event per state), no state can make both event6 and event3 true simultaneously.

4. Therefore C1 can never be true in any state, so C1 never holds.

5. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 never holds, C2 is false.

Reasoning:

2. Initially event2 holds. After event2, one of {event4, event5, event6, event7} must occur, so a state with event4 is reachable.
3. In a state where event4 holds, event6 does not hold (only one event true per state), so the implication ""if event4 then event6"" (C1) is false in that state.

1. C1 is true immediately because the context says ""Initially, event1 happened.""
2. So C2 reduces to the requirement that event6 occurs at some point.
3. From event1 you may choose event5 (allowed by ""After event1, ... event5 ... must happen"").
4. From event5 you must go to event4, and from event4 you may choose event5 again. Thus the infinite trace 1 (initial) → 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → ... is allowed.
5. In that trace event6 never occurs, even though C1 holds from the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = ""Event7 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the immediate successor state (after the initial event3) event7 must eventually occur on every possible future path.
2. From the initial state (event3), the next state must be one of: event1, event2, or event4.
3. Check whether, from each of these possible next states, event7 is unavoidable:
   - From event1 you can go to event2 (choices from event1: event2, event5, event6).
   - From event2 you can go back to event1 (choices from event2: event1, event5, event7).
   - Thus there is a cycle event1 → event2 → event1 → ... that avoids event7 forever.
4. Because from event1 (and likewise from event2) there are choices that keep you looping between event1 and event2 and never reach event7, C1 does not necessarily hold at those states.
5. From event4 you can go to event5 or event6 (or event7). From event5 you can go to event2, and then follow the same event2↔event1 loop to avoid event7. So event4 also has a path that avoids event7.
6. Therefore, in the next state (which may be event1, event2, or event4) it is not guaranteed that event7 will eventually occur. C2 is false."

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" means event2 holds in every state (a global/invariant property).
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" is a state formula true at the initial state iff either event3 holds now (in the initial state) or C1 holds.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- Initially event1 happened, so event2 does not hold in the initial state. Therefore C1 (event2 holds in every state) is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 at the initial state:
- Event3 does not hold initially (initial is event1).
- C1 is false (from Step 2).
- So the disjunction ""event3 or C1"" is false at the initial state.

(If ""event3 happens"" were interpreted as ""eventually event3 happens"", C2 would still not be guaranteed: there is a run 1 -> 6 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 ... that never visits event3, so ""event3 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed and C2 would still be false.)

Reasoning (brief):
- The formulas C1 and C2 are plain state propositions (no ""next"" or ""eventually""). They require events to hold in the same state.
- At any single state exactly one event occurs, so a conjunction of two distinct events (e.g., event4 AND event6) cannot be true in any state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the conjunction ""event5 and event7"" — it requires both events to hold in the same state.
2. The event model here (as in the examples) treats states as single events: after any event exactly one of the listed next events happens. Thus two different events cannot be true simultaneously in one state.
3. Therefore C1 can never be true in any state (you can have event5 in one state and event7 in another, but not both together).

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 holds. After event5, the next state can be event1, event2, or event4.
- C1 is the state formula ""if event2 then event7"". This is true in any state where event2 is false (vacuously), and false exactly in a state where event2 is true and event7 is false.
- Check C1 in each possible next state:
  - Next = event1: event2 is false → C1 true.
  - Next = event2: event2 is true but event7 is false in that same state → C1 false.
  - Next = event4: event2 is false → C1 true.
- Because there is a possible next state (event2) where C1 is false, C1 does not hold in all next states. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

1. C1 is ""Event6 always happens"" — i.e., in every state/event, event6 holds.
2. The context states: ""Initially, event5 happened."" So in the initial state the event is event5, not event6.
3. Therefore C1 is false in the initial state (event6 does not hold there).
4. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — that requires C1 to be true in every state (in particular, true at the initial state).
5. Since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 cannot hold.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event7 happens or event7 happens"", which is simply Event7.
2. C2 is ""C1 holds and event5 happens"" → Event7 AND Event5 (both in the same state).
3. By the model semantics (one event true per state), two different events cannot be true simultaneously, so Event7 and Event5 cannot hold in the same state.
4. Additionally, the initial state is Event4 and there are no transitions in the context that lead to Event5, so Event5 never happens at any time.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = ""Event4 does not happen"" — i.e., in the current state event4 is false.
2. C2 = ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" — i.e., the current state must be event3 (so event3 true) and event4 false.
3. The initial state is event2 (given).
4. In the initial state event3 is false, so C2 is false at the initial state.
5. (Side note) Although event3 can occur later on some paths (and in an event3 state event4 is indeed false, so C2 could hold at a future state), the proposition C2 is not true in the initial state, so the answer is False."

Reasoning:
- C1 is the proposition ""Event6 does not happen"" (a state formula).
- Initially event5 happened, so Event6 is not happening in the initial state; thus C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. the negation of C1 (equivalently ""Event6 happens"" in the current state). Since C1 is true initially, its negation is false.

1. C2 says: ""If event1 happens, then (event3 or event6) holds"" — interpreted as: in any state where event1 is true, event3 or event6 must also be true in that same state.  
2. From the context, the initial state has event1 true.  
3. In this model only one event can hold in a single state, so when event1 is true, event3 and event6 are false in that state.  
4. Thus at the initial state the antecedent (event1) is true while the consequent (event3 or event6) is false, making the implication false.

- C1 = ""Event2 does not happen."" At the initial state event2 is indeed false, so C1 holds initially.
- C2 = ""Event6 happens and C1 holds."" That requires event6 to be true in the same (initial) state. But event6 is false initially (event5 is true), so the conjunction is false at the initial state.

</graphml>",0,"Let's reason step by step.

1. Initial condition: event6 happened (so in the initial state event6 is true, and event1, event2, event3 are false).
2. C1 = (event3 or event1). In the initial state neither event3 nor event1 holds, so C1 is false initially.
3. C2 = (C1 or event2). Since C1 is false and event2 is false in the initial state, C2 is false in the initial state.
4. (Note: although from event6 the next state could be event1 or event2, C2 as given is not prefixed by any temporal operator — it is evaluated at the current state.)

Conclusion: False"
