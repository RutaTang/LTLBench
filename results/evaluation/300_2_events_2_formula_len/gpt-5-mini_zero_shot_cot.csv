- We must decide whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the context.

- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (e1 → next e2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (e2 → next e1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- t0: event2 (given).
- t1: because of t0, event1 must happen.
- t2: because of t1, event2 must happen.
- t3: because of t2, event1 must happen.
- And so on — they alternate forever: e2, e1, e2, e1, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): true in this system — e2 occurs at t0 and then at every even step thereafter, so it never stops occurring.
- C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds""): since C1 is true regardless, the implication is true. Moreover, whenever e1 does happen it leads to e2 and the alternating pattern ensures e2 continues to occur.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every reachable state (on every path) it is true that event2 eventually happens.
You must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So in the initial state event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So any state where event2 has happened is terminal (no further events).
- (The ""after event1, no other events can happen"" clause is irrelevant because event1 does not occur initially and cannot occur after event2.)

Step 3 — trace the possible executions
- The initial state already has event2. From that state no further events can occur (because after event2 nothing can happen). There are no other reachable states in which event2 has not happened.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 holds in the initial (and only) reachable state because event2 has already occurred — so ""event2 eventually happens"" is true.
- Since there are no other reachable states where C1 could fail, C1 holds in all states. Therefore C2 is True.

We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the background facts.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has happened (at least at the initial time).
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event1 cannot occur after that initial event2.
- (Also: if event1 were to happen, event2 must happen afterward — but that is irrelevant because event1 cannot happen after the initial event2.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and then C2
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Because event2 has happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of event1.

- Initially, event1 happened.
- The context also says: after event1, no other events can happen. That forbids any events in any state after the initial one (including event1 happening again in the next state).

- Given the context, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false in every model consistent with the context.

- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Because C1 is impossible under the context, (C1 → event1) is true in all models consistent with the context. (Also note event1 in fact happened initially, so the consequent is true too, but vacuous truth is enough.)

- C2 (at s0) requires C1 to be true when evaluated at s1; that is, it requires event1 to happen in s2. But s2 cannot have any events because event1 in s1 forbids any further events. Therefore C1 is false when evaluated at s1, so C2 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The hypothesis C1 states: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" The antecedent of C2 is exactly C1, and the consequent is the same atomic claim C1 asserts.
- An implication of the form (C1 → C1) is always true (either because the antecedent entails the consequent, or vacuously true if the antecedent is false).
- Note: from the given context C1 is not guaranteed (there are models with alternating events where event1 does not occur in the immediate next state), but that does not affect C2’s truth — the implication is still true in all models.

Therefore C2 is True."

- C2 says ""C1 always holds"", where C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" The question: Given the context, is it necessarily true that Event2 never happens (i.e., C2 is True or False)?

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So the trace starts with event1 already having occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, the execution is terminal: no further events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant if event2 can never occur, but it would constrain traces where event2 precedes event1.)

Step 3 — trace reasoning
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any point in any allowed execution.
- The only way to allow event2 would be for it to occur before event1, but the scenario starts with event1 already happened (no prior events are allowed), so that is not possible.

Conclusion
- Event2 does not happen in any allowed execution, so C1 always holds.

- “After event2, no other events can happen” means there is no successor state after the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C1 itself would be true in any state, but C2 quantifies over the next state.
- Because there is no next state (the trace terminates immediately after the initial event2), the claim “C1 holds in the next state” is not satisfied under the usual semantics where “next” requires an existing successor state.

- C2 is False."

- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, the system permits no further events.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" This is irrelevant unless event2 occurs, since it only constrains what happens after event2.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no events that can occur at any later time. In particular, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Event2 also cannot have happened before the initial state, because the initial state is specified as event1 happened (so the actual execution begins with event1 having occurred).
- Therefore, event2 never occurs in the execution.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a reflexive implication (A → A).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That claims the implication in C1 is true at all relevant points/times.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2 no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about C1 in this context
- An implication of the form A → A is a logical tautology: whenever A is true, A is true; and when A is false, A → A is still true (in standard logic). So C1 is true in every possible state/point regardless of which events occur.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 is true at every point, ""C1 always holds"" is true.

- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true in the actual history.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 already happened initially, there is no time for any other events to occur afterwards.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only forbids events after event1, but it does not contradict that event2 already happened initially.

Step 3 — reason about event sequences:
- Because event2 happens initially and no events can occur after it, there is no model in which event2 fails to happen. So event2 is true in every permissible history.
- C1 (""if event1 then event2"") is therefore true: either vacuously (if event1 never happens) or because event2 already happened regardless. In all cases, whenever event1 happens, event2 also happens (since event2 occurred initially).

- Initially event1 happened: at time 0, event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen: once event1 has occurred, no events occur at any later times (so for all t>0, event1 and event2 are false).
- After event2, event1 must happen: if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterwards. This is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- At time 0, X(event1) (C1 at time 0) asks whether event1 is true at time 1. But by ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no events occur at time 1, so event1 is false at time 1. Thus C1 is false at time 0.
- For C2 to be true, there must be some time t where X(event1) holds (i.e. event1 is true at t+1). But once event1 has occurred initially, no events happen at any later times, so event1 never becomes true again at any future time. Hence there is no t with X(event1) true.

- C2 is the claim ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. at some future point Event1 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (this only stops further events; it does not prevent event1 from occurring when required).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- event2 has already occurred.
- By the rule, event1 must occur after event2, so event1 will occur next.

- Since event1 will occur after the initial event2, C1 becomes true at some point; therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That is a propositional tautology (p → p). A formula of the form p → p is true in every state regardless of whether p is true or false.

Step 3 — the next state in the scenario
From the context: initially event2 happened; after that event1 must happen, so the ""next state"" contains event1 (and, by the third rule, no further events happen after event1). Whether event2 holds in that next state or not does not matter for C1 because C1 is always true.

Step 4 — conclusion
Since C1 is true in every state, it also holds in the next state. Therefore C2 is True.

- Initially (state S0), event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies in the next state (S1) after S0, event2 must occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" implies after any state where event2 occurs, the following state must have event1.

- By the rule after event1, S1 must have event2.

- C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is true in the next state S1, so C2 is True.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens.""

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happened — so at the initial moment C1 is true (because event1 happens then).
   - ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred there are no further events.
   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (no events can occur after the initial event1).

3. Interpret ""happens"" as an instantaneous occurrence at a time, and ""always"" as quantifying over all times. Under that standard reading:
   - At times after the initial moment neither event1 nor event2 ""happens"" (they are instantaneous and already occurred or impossible), so C1 is false at those later times.
   - Therefore C1 is not true at all times.

4. Conclusion: C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the formula P → P (with P = ""event1 happens""), which is a logical tautology — it is true in every state (true whether P is true or false).

Step 3 — trace relevance of the context

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event1 occurs and no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is false in this situation: event1 happens but event2 does not.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: The implication ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" means: whenever event2 occurs, it follows that event2 occurs at some (possibly the same) time in the run.

Step 3 — reasoning:
- If event2 happens at some point in a run, then by definition there exists a time in that run when event2 happens — that is exactly what C1 asserts. So the antecedent implies the consequent.
- Even in general logic, ""p implies 'eventually p'"" is true whenever p occurs (and is vacuously true if p never occurs). In our specific context p (event2) does occur initially, so the implication certainly holds.

- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False. C1 is ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — restate the context conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 has already occurred at the start.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (No events can occur at any time after that initial event1.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then some event1 must occur after it.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, no further events can ever occur in the timeline. In particular, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No — the initial condition says event1 happened initially (there is no earlier time where event2 could have occurred).
- Could event2 occur simultaneously with event1, or could event1 occur again after event2? The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" forbids any events after the initial event1, so simultaneous occurrence or a later event1 would violate that rule or is not allowed by the stated ordering.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur in any allowed timeline. That makes C1 true in all possible evolutions.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is necessarily true given the context, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur in any subsequent state.
- After event2, no other events can happen (this makes event2 also terminal if it could occur).

Examine the conditions and trace possibilities:
- C1 states: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context that event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur in any next state. So C1 is false in the actual (and all allowed) traces of the context.
- C2 is the implication: if event2 happens (antecedent), then C1 holds (consequent: event2 happens in the next state). But in every model consistent with the context, event2 never happens (because event1 has already occurred and forbids further events). Therefore the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is impossible in all allowed traces, making the implication vacuously true.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after every event1).
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after every event2).

Step 3 — Trace the forced sequence
- At time 0: event1 happened (given).
- Because after event1 event2 must happen, event2 will occur at some later time.
- After that event2, event1 must happen again.
- After that event1, event2 must happen again.
- This enforces an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") cannot become true permanently, because event2 is required to occur after each event1, and event1 keeps being required after each event2.
- Therefore there is no future point after which event2 never occurs; C1 never comes to hold permanently.

- C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (G (F event1)): at every point in time, event1 will eventually occur.
You are asked whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial time point event1 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then some later event1 must occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal; once it has happened, there are no further events).

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Because event1 happened initially, the system is already in a state after event1; by ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" there are no further events in this execution. So event1 does not occur again later.
- C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true at the initial time (it has already happened).
- But C2 requires that at every time point, event1 will eventually happen. Consider the time point immediately after the initial event1: from that point on there are no events, so there is no future occurrence of event1 — thus F event1 is false at that time point.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- Since there exists a reachable time point (immediately after the initial event1) where ""event1 will eventually happen"" is false, C2 (that C1 always holds) is not satisfied.

- Could event2 have happened before event1? No: if event2 had happened before, then after event2 no other events could happen, so event1 could not have happened afterward. That would contradict the given that event1 happened initially. So event2 never happens in this scenario.

- C2 asserts that C1 always holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen (so in the actual execution, event2 cannot occur).
- Also, after event2 no other events can happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — reason about C1
- The formula p → p is a logical tautology: it is true whenever p is true, and also true whenever p is false (an implication with the same antecedent and consequent is always true).
- So C1 is true in every possible state/trace: if event2 happens then (trivially) event2 happens; if event2 does not happen, the implication is vacuously true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 is a tautology, it holds in all situations allowed by the context. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

You are asked whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- The context states that event1 happened initially and that after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur after event1. That may make C1 (both events occur) impossible in the given scenario, but it does not change the logical form of C2.

Step 3 — logical reasoning
- C2 is the implication (event1 ∧ event2) → event2. This is a tautology of propositional logic: from a conjunction you can always infer either conjunct. Even if the antecedent (C1) is impossible/false, a material implication with a false antecedent is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says “event2 always happens” (i.e. at every future point event2 holds).
- The context fixes the initial step: event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen — the execution is terminal immediately after the initial event2.
- C1 can be true at the initial state (event2 has happened and nothing contradicts “always” from that starting point), but C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state.
- There is no next state (no successor) after the initial event2, and under the standard “next” semantics (Next φ requires an actual successor state where φ holds), Next(C1) is false.

Therefore C2 is False."

Examine C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in any situation where the antecedent and consequent are the same proposition.

Context doesn't change that:
- Initially event1 has happened (so C1 is vacuously satisfied there).
- The other rules (after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen) do not create any counterexample to p → p.

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no further transitions).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here since event2 never occurs given the initial event1 and its blocking property).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- The system starts with event1 already happened. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen"", there are no subsequent states in which any event (including event1) can occur.
- Therefore there is no state that has a next state where event1 occurs. C1 is false in every state (there is no future occurrence of event1).

Step-by-step reasoning
1. Hypothesis target: determine whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true or false. C1 is ""Event2 does not happen.""
2. From the context: initially event1 happens. The rules say after event1, event2 must happen; and after event2, event1 must happen. So starting from the initial event1, an event2 is required to occur afterwards.
3. Since an event2 must occur after the initial event1, the proposition C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false (event2 does happen).
4. C2 asserts that at some future point C1 becomes true (i.e., eventually event2 does not happen from that point on). That is impossible here because the rules force event2 to occur (and to alternate with event1) repeatedly.

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, both event2 and event1 occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 has occurred).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — no events can occur in any later state).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event2 is terminal, no events can occur after the state where event2 happened. Thus event1 cannot occur in any state after event2.
- The initial state already has event2; there is no earlier state in which event1 could have occurred (initial is the start). Therefore event1 does not occur at any point in the timeline.
- Hence C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is false in the initial state and will not become true later.

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" (in temporal logic: G event2).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (F (G event2)): at some future point, from then on event2 holds at every step.
- From the context: initially event2 happened. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur after that initial event2. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes event1 a terminal event — after it, event2 cannot occur again.
- Therefore there will be a future moment (when event1 occurs) after which event2 never happens. That prevents G event2 from holding at any point (there is no time from which event2 holds forever).

- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means at every future point (from the point the claim is evaluated) event1 holds; i.e., event1 holds at all times (a global/always property).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means there is some time from which onward C1 is true (i.e., from some point on, event1 holds at every time).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happened (so at the initial moment event1 did not hold).
- Rule A: after event2, event1 must happen (so sometime after any occurrence of event2 there must be an occurrence of event1).
- Rule B: after event1, event2 must happen (so sometime after any occurrence of event1 there must be an occurrence of event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequences
- Starting with initial event2, rule A forces an event1 later.
- After that event1, rule B forces an event2 later.
- Repeating, the system must alternate: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- So event1 occurs infinitely often, but there are times where event2 occurs instead of event1. In particular, event1 is not true at every moment.

Step 4 — can C1 eventually hold?
- Suppose for contradiction that C2 were true: at some time t0, C1 holds forever after (i.e., from t0 onward event1 always holds).
- Then at time t0 (or immediately after) event1 must hold. But rule B then requires a subsequent event2 after that event1, contradicting that event1 holds at every future time.
- Therefore it's impossible for there to be a time after which event1 holds at all times.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The claim C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens."" In the initial state that is true because the context says event1 happened initially.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, i.e., from the next state onward ""event1 eventually happens.""
- ""Eventually"" is a future operator: it requires event1 to occur at or after the considered state. Once initial state has passed, event1 has already occurred in the past, so it does not count for the future from the next state.
- The context forces the sequence: event1 (initial) → event2 → no further events. There is no opportunity for event1 to occur again after the next state.
- Therefore, from the next state onward event1 will not eventually happen, so C1 is false in that state.

- After any Event1, Event2 must happen later (whenever Event1 occurs, a later Event2 is required).
- After any Event2, Event1 must happen later (whenever Event2 occurs, a later Event1 is required).

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- Because Event2 happened initially, the rule ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"" forces that an Event1 will occur at some later point.
- Once that Event1 occurs, the rule ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"" forces another Event2 later.
- This produces an alternating sequence starting from the initial Event2: Event2 (initial) → Event1 → Event2 → Event1 → ... .
- Therefore Event2 does indeed eventually happen (it already did initially and continues to recur), so C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2 (""C1 always holds"")
C2 requires that C1 be true at every point in time along every execution. Consider the state after event2: no further events occur, and from that point forward event1 does not happen. If C1 is interpreted as “event1 will always happen from now on,” then C1 is false after event2. Therefore C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 is false.

- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"". So we must decide whether there is any possible future (or present) point where both event2 and event1 have happened.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes event2 terminal: once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (This makes event1 terminal too, but it only matters if event1 were to occur.)

Step 3 — reason about event order
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial moment.
- There is no information allowing event1 to have happened before the initial moment; ""initially"" denotes the earliest state, so event1 cannot have occurred earlier.
- Simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment is not provided by the context; given the usual temporal interpretation, event1 is not true initially.

Step 4 — conclusion
- It is impossible for both event2 and event1 to have happened in any reachable state. Therefore C1 never holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.

- You must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate thereafter).

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", C1 is true at the initial state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication: if C1 holds then event1 happens.
- Since C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state, whenever C1 holds the consequent (""event1 happens"") is also true. In the given scenario C1 does hold and event1 does happen.

Step 2 — conditions

- After event1, no other events can happen (the execution terminates after event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially (in the current state) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs in a later state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the sequence of states:

- State1 (next): event1 happens (and because event1 is terminal, no further events after State1).
- In State1, event2 does not happen (it happened originally in State0).

- Since event2 happened initially, the very next state is after event2. By ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the next state cannot have any events occur there. Therefore event1 cannot occur in the next state.

- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen (at the start).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Symmetric constraint, but irrelevant once event1 occurs first.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 nothing else can happen, event2 cannot occur after event1.
- There is no earlier time for event2 to have happened because event1 is stated to have happened initially (the start). Thus event2 does not happen at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The antecedent (""event1 happens"") is true (it did happen).
- The consequent (""event2 eventually happens"", i.e. C1) is false (event2 cannot and does not happen).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts: event2 happens and event1 happens.
- Context says: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterward.
- Could event1 occur before event2? No — if event1 occurred, then after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 could not occur afterward.
- Therefore there is no possible sequence in which both event1 and event2 occur. C1 is false, so the claim C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false."

Given the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event2 would require a later event1). But event1 already occurred initially, so a later event1 would be required if event2 were to occur — and that is impossible because no events can occur after the initial event1.

Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time. C1 (""event2 happens and event2 happens"") is false, and C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is also false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every point in every run, event2 will occur at some future point).
- From the context: initially event2 happened. The rules say (a) after event2, event1 must happen, and (b) after event1 no other events can happen.
- Therefore the only possible sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 → no more events.
- C1 is true at the start (event2 has happened). But C2 requires that at every state along every run, event2 is guaranteed to occur later. After event1, there are no further events, so from that state ""event2 eventually happens"" is false.
- Thus C2 does not hold in all states/runs.

- Because event2 happened initially, the next state must have event1.
- Therefore in the next state: event1 is true; event2 is not required to be true there (indeed C1 is false).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule A: After any event1, an event2 must happen later.
- Rule B: After any event2, an event1 must happen later.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- Since event2 happened initially, by Rule B an event1 must occur afterward. So event1 does occur (at least once).
- After that event1, Rule A forces another event2, and then Rule B forces another event1, etc. So events alternate indefinitely: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Because event2 occurs (initially and repeatedly), event1 is not true at every moment; C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- However, the plain claim ""Event1 happens"" (there exists at least one occurrence) is true.

Step 2 — the given conditions

- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Starting from the initial event2, the rules force an alternating sequence: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … So event1 occurs at t1, t3, … but not at t0 (and not at every time point).

C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would mean event1 holds at every time point. That is false because at t0 event2 occurred and event1 did not. So C1 is false.

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 occurs, it prevents any subsequent events.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs, it prevents any subsequent events.)

Step 3 — trace possible orders
- Could event1 occur after the initial event2? No, because after event2 no other events can happen.
- Could event1 have occurred before the initial event2? No, because ""initially"" means event2 is already the starting occurrence; there is no earlier time in this model. Even if one tried to place event1 before, that would contradict the fact that event2 occurs afterwards, because after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 could not then occur.

Given premises:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Analysis (concise, non-sensitive):
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur (it would be ""after event1"").
- C1 is the claim ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 did happen but event2 cannot, C1 is false.

Even if one tried to place event1 at the same instant as event2, the requirement ""after event1, event2 must happen"" would not be satisfied unless ""after"" allowed the same instant — the natural reading forbids that.
- Therefore event1 does not occur at any reachable state.

Step 3 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 asserts both event2 and event1 happen. Given the above, event2 happens but event1 does not, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. The next state has no events (by ""after event2, no other events can happen""), so C1 is also false there.

Step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1 is just ""event1 happens"" (the conjunction ""event1 and event1"" is equivalent to event1).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. that event1 holds in the next state.
- From the context: initially event1 holds (so C1 holds now). The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to hold in the next state, but it does not require event1 to hold there.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" then forces event1 in the following state (two steps ahead), not necessarily in the immediate next state.

Thus event1 in the next state is not guaranteed (a valid trace is: S0: event1; S1: event2; S2: event1). Therefore C2 is not entailed — False."

- C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"".
- C1 is ""Event2 always happens"".
So C2 is true exactly when (a) Event2 does occur, and (b) Event2 necessarily always occurs (i.e. C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. So from the initial event1, a (future) event2 is required.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. So any event2 is followed by another event1.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Starting with the initial event1, Rule A forces an event2 to occur.
- That event2, by Rule B, forces another event1, which again forces another event2, and so on ad infinitum.
- Therefore event2 does occur, and it occurs repeatedly (so in every continuation following the rules, event2 will occur).

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true under these rules (event2 is inevitably required and recurs).
- Event2 happens is also true.

- C1 is the statement ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — effectively this just requires that Event1 happens.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., in the given situation, Event1 happens).

From the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, no other events can happen (so once Event2 has occurred, nothing else can occur).
- After Event1, no other events can happen (Event1 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Because Event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after Event2, Event1 cannot occur (afterwards). The initial facts do not state that Event1 has happened as well, so Event1 is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 is not true in the given situation, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Trace the sequence:

- Thus the system alternates forever: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") means from some point onward, at every step event1 is true.

- C2 claims C1 eventually holds. Because C1 is already false (there is an occurrence of event1 without event2) and nothing in the future can make C1 true, C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 occurs.
- The rules force alternation: after event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1. So from the initial event1 we get event2, then event1, then event2, … forever alternating.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would mean event1 holds at every moment (or at every step). That is false here because at the steps when event2 occurs, event1 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

- C1 = ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (equivalently, C2 just says ""Event1 happens"" since C1 is implied by event1.)

Step 2 — examine conditions from the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So given the initial event2, event1 will (must) happen later.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That simply makes event1 terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Time 0: event2 occurs (given).
- Because after event2 event1 must happen, event1 occurs at some later time.
- After event1 nothing else happens.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event2 or event1"") is true (event2 did happen, and event1 also happens).
- C2 requires event1 to happen (and C1 to hold). Since event1 does happen, and C1 holds, C2 is true.

C2 asserts that C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") holds at all times (in every reachable state).

Step 2 — examine the system states
- Initial state S0: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred at S0.
- From S0, event2 must happen, leading to a state S1 after event2.
- After S1, no other events can happen (terminal state).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in each state
- In S0, C1 is true (event1 has happened already, so ""eventually event1"" holds at S0).
- In S1, no further events will occur and event1 is not going to happen again, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is false at S1.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
Because C1 is not true in every reachable state (it fails at S1), C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

</graphml>",1.0,"First: hypothesis C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — we must decide if C1 is true in every possible behavior consistent with the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred in the initial state.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So some time after the initial event1, event2 will occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).

Trace reasoning:
- Because event1 happened initially, any later occurrence of event2 will have event1 already having occurred (at the initial time).
- The rules do not allow event2 to happen before the initial event1 (there is no earlier time than the initial state where event2 could occur), and the context actually enforces that event2 follows event1.
- Therefore in every allowed trace, whenever event2 happens, event1 has happened (earlier).

Conclusion: C1 holds in all possible behaviors allowed by the context, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True"
