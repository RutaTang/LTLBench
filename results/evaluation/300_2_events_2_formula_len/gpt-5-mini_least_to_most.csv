Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (that is given as true at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 occurs, the system becomes stuck).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 occurs, the system becomes stuck).
- Because event2 happens initially, no subsequent events can occur in the future of the initial state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Interpreting standard temporal ""eventually"" (F), this means: at the current time there exists some time now or in the future at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting standard ""always"" (G), this means: at every time point along the execution, C1 is true. Equivalently, for every time t, there is some time ≥ t at which event2 occurs (G F event2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Evaluate C1 at the initial time: true, because event2 has already happened (F(event2) holds now).
- Evaluate C1 at a later time (any time after the initial time): false, because after the initial event2 no other events can happen, so there is no occurrence of event2 at or after that later time.
- Therefore G F(event2) (C2) is false: although C1 is true at the initial time, it does not hold at all later times.

Conclusion: C2 is False (counterexample/time witness: any time strictly after the initial moment — there is no future occurrence of event2, so ""event2 eventually happens"" is false there). 

Note on alternative readings: If you instead interpret C1 as the state proposition ""event2 has occurred at least once in the past or now"" (a past-looking property), then that variant would be true at the initial time and remain true thereafter, and the corresponding ""always"" version would be true. Under the usual forward-looking interpretation of ""eventually,"" however, C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, event2 must follow.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred, no further events may occur — event2 is terminal.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreted as: event1 does not occur in the current (or in all) states being considered.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted as: in the next state (the immediate successor state), event1 does not happen.

(There is no C3 given in the problem statement; only C1 and C2 need evaluation.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true or false?
- Because the system starts after event2 and Rule B says no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur in any state that follows the initial state.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is true for the initial and all subsequent states.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also true: in the next state event1 does not happen.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Note on assumptions: this uses the natural reading that ""after event2, no other events can happen"" prohibits event1 in any subsequent state. If instead the phrases had a different technical meaning (for example, ""after"" meaning only “at some unspecified future moment”), you should state that interpretation, but under the usual reading above C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 has occurred and Rule B forbids any further events, so event1 cannot occur in the next state; therefore C1 holds in the next state, making C2 true."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 has happened.

(I'm reading ""initially, event2 happened"" as: event2 is true at the initial time.)

2) Transition rules (formalized)
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpret as: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur sometime later. In temporal logic: G( event1 -> F event2 ).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — similarly: G( event2 -> F event1 ).

(Here ""after"" is interpreted as ""eventually after"" (F), and G means the implication holds whenever the antecedent holds.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — formal: F(event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — formal: F(C1) = F( F(event1) ).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the initial event2 and the rule G(event2 -> F event1), at time 0 we get F(event1). Thus C1 holds at the initial time, so C1 is true.
- C2 is F(F(event1)). In standard linear-time semantics F(F p) is equivalent to F p (if p holds at some time t, then there is some time ≤ t where F p holds, and vice versa). Therefore F(F(event1)) is equivalent to F(event1). Since C1 is true, C2 is true as well.

So C2 is True (given the usual interpretation of ""after"" = eventually and ""initially"" = true at time 0).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Explanation: at time 0 event2 holds, so by G(event2 -> F event1) we have F(event1) (C1) at time 0; therefore F(C1) (C2) holds. (Also F(F p) ≡ F p.)"

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"": whenever event2 occurs, event1 will (later) occur.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"": whenever event1 occurs, event2 will (later) occur.
- Together with the initial event1, these rules produce a sequence event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (so both events do occur, repeatedly).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Logically this is an implication A → A, which is always true (a tautology). Even without the dynamics, A → A is true for any proposition A; with the dynamics, event1 does occur anyway, so the implication is satisfied.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" This is a disjunction: C2 is true if at least one of (C1 holds) or (event2 happens) is true.

4) How they relate and final truth values
- C1 is true (A → A is always true, and here event1 does occur).
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" is true regardless of whether event2 occurs. (In this scenario event2 also does occur, but that is unnecessary once C1 is true.)
- Therefore C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: initially E2 happened (E2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After E2, E1 must happen: E2 ⇒ E1 (i.e., because E2 occurred, E1 will occur).
- After E1, no other events can happen (ends the sequence). This does not prevent E1 from occurring, it only forbids further events after E1.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event2 happens” = E1 ∨ E2.
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds” = E1 ∨ C1, i.e. E1 ∨ (E1 ∨ E2). (No other Ci given.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition and the rule E2 ⇒ E1, both E2 and E1 occur. So E2 = true and E1 = true.
- Therefore C1 = E1 ∨ E2 = true.
- C2 = E1 ∨ C1 is then true (indeed C1 is true, and E1 is also true). Note C2 is logically redundant here because C1 ⇒ C2; with C1 true, C2 must be true.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: E2 is true and E2 ⇒ E1, so E1 is true. Thus C1 = E1 ∨ E2 is true, and C2 = E1 ∨ C1 is therefore true (indeed C2 simplifies to E1 ∨ E2)."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So starting from the initial event2, event1 will occur next, then event2 again, and so on (alternating).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens"" (a redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 4 — how they relate and the truth value of C2
- From the initial condition and the transition rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 does occur (at least once immediately after the initial event2).
- Therefore C1 (Event1 happens) is true.
- C2, being the negation of C1, is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial moment).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur later).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is ambiguous:
  - Reading 1 (strong): event2 holds at all times (every moment) — unlikely and false here because initially only event1 happened, not event2 at that same instant.
  - Reading 2 (typical in these puzzles): event2 is guaranteed to occur (i.e. it will happen at least once, or even infinitely often thereafter). Under the rules and the given initial event1, this reading is true: event1 forces a later event2, and rules cause them to alternate.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" A disjunction: either event1 occurs (which it does already initially) or C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event1 has already happened (given), the disjunction C2 is true immediately, regardless of how you read C1. 
- (If you adopt Reading 2 for C1 then C1 is also true under the rules and initial event1, so C2 is true in that sense as well. Under the strong Reading 1 for C1, C1 is false but C2 is still true because event1 did happen.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).
Given that event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur in this scenario.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; logically C1 ≡ (event2). (It asserts that event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally C2 is the implication C1 → event2. Since C1 ≡ event2, C2 is the formula (event2 → event2).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- In the given scenario event2 does not actually occur (because event1 occurred and forbids any other events), so C1 is false in the scenario.
- The implication C2 is either seen as (event2 → event2), which is a tautology (always true), or seen as an implication with a false antecedent (C1 false), which makes the implication true vacuously in classical logic.

Short answer: C2 is True when evaluated in the initial state. Below is the stepwise reasoning.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it t0), event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- If event2 happened in a state, then in the next state event1 must happen.
- If event1 happened in a state, then in the next state event2 must happen.
(So states alternate: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, ….)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” — a proposition about a single state (true in a state iff event2 did not occur in that state).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e. in the successor state, event2 does not happen.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At t0 (initial): event2 happened, so C1 is false at t0.
- C2 evaluated at t0 asks: does C1 hold at t1? By the transition rule, t1 must have event1 (since t0 had event2), so event2 does not happen at t1. Therefore C1 is true at t1, so C2 is true at t0.

(If you instead evaluate C2 at t1, it would be false there, because t2 must have event2. The truth of C2 depends on which state you evaluate it in; in the initial state it is True.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: In the initial state t0 event2 occurred, so the next state t1 must have event1 (and thus not event2). Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") holds at t1, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true at t0."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- Let p = ""event1 happens.""
- C1 is ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" = p ∧ p. This is equivalent to p (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" = (p ∧ p) → p.

4) How they relate and truth value of C2
- Logically, p ∧ p ≡ p, so C2 simplifies to p → p, which is a tautology (always true).
- In the given context p is indeed true (event1 happens because event2 happened), so the antecedent of C2 holds and the consequent holds — again making the implication true.
- Even if p were false, (p ∧ p) → p would still be true (vacuous truth). Thus C2 is true in every case.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Answer: C2 is False (it does not hold). Explanation step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen.
Interpretation of these rules: when a state has event1 (or event2), there is no successor state in which any (other) event occurs. In other words, a state that has event1 (or event2) is terminal with respect to further events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This asserts that in the state immediately following the current one, event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that in every future state, the next-state property C1 is true — equivalently, at every point we look, the very next state has event1.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and why C2 is false?
- From the initial condition we know event1 happened now. The transition rule “after event1, no other events can happen” implies there are no further event occurrences after this state (the state is terminal w.r.t. events). Therefore the next state does not contain any event occurrences, so C1 (that event1 happens in the next state) is false.
- If C1 is false at the initial point, then C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false as well.
- Even under a more permissive reading of “no other events” (interpreting “other” to mean “different events” so event1 might repeat), nothing in the premises guarantees that event1 will occur in the next state or in all future states. Thus C1 is not guaranteed, and C2 is not guaranteed.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterward (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- If event2 occurs, no other events can occur afterward (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state—no further events can occur after that.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (logical OR).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" i.e. C2 = C1 ∨ event1.

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- From 1, event2 has happened, so the disjunct ""event2 happens"" is true. Therefore C1 = (event1 ∨ event2) is true.
- Since C1 is true, C2 = (C1 ∨ event1) is also true (true ∨ anything = true).

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so if event2 occurs, the run is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

(From the rules and the initial condition we know in the actual scenario event2 occurred and event1 did not occur — but that fact will not matter for the logical evaluation below.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally, C1 is (event1 → event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Formally, C2 is (C1 ∨ event1), i.e. (event1 → event1) ∨ event1.
(There is no C3 given.)

4) How they relate / truth evaluation
- In classical logic, p → p is a tautology (always true) for any proposition p. So C1 is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens.
- Therefore C2 = (C1 ∨ event1) = (True ∨ event1) = True.

Short answer: C2 is True (assuming ""must happen"" expresses a liveness requirement that is enforced).

Step‑by‑step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (call that time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e., whenever event2 happens, event1 will later happen).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., whenever event1 happens, event2 will later happen).

I read “must happen” as a liveness requirement: whenever the antecedent event occurs, the consequent event will eventually occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is equivalent to just “event2 happens” (the conjunction repeats the same claim).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” That is, “eventually (event2 happens).” In plain terms: at some future time there will be an occurrence of event2.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / evaluation of C2?
- Since event1 already occurred initially, apply Rule B: after that occurrence of event1, event2 must (eventually) occur. Therefore there will be some time after the initial moment when event2 occurs, so C1 becomes true at that time. Hence C2 — “eventually C1” — is satisfied.
- Furthermore, once event2 occurs, Rule A forces event1 again, and by Rule B event2 again, yielding an infinite alternation (event1, event2, event1, event2, ...). That also guarantees event2 occurs (indeed infinitely often), so C2 holds.

Caveat: this conclusion depends on interpreting “must happen” as an enforced eventuality (a liveness guarantee). If instead the rules are merely declarative constraints that could be violated in an execution and nothing forces the system to comply, then satisfaction is execution-dependent. Under the usual reading that these rules enforce the required transitions, C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event2, event1 must happen” means: because event2 happened, event1 will (necessarily) happen later.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means: once event1 occurs it’s terminal — nothing happens after it.
- Combined timeline consistent with both rules: event2 happens first (initially), then event1 happens, then nothing else.

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event2 happens.” Given the timeline, event2 has happened and event1 must happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens.” Logically C2 = (event1 or event2) or event1 = event1 or event2, so C2 is equivalent to C1.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Since event2 happened initially and event1 must happen afterward, both event1 and event2 occur. Therefore C1 is true.
- Because C2 is logically equivalent to C1 (and/or event1), C2 is also true.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (call that time t0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. sometime after any occurrence of event2, event1 will occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. sometime after any occurrence of event1, event2 will occur).
These rules force an alternation of occurrences: starting from an event2 at t0, there will be an event1 later, then an event2 later, and so on (infinitely repeating).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Interpreted as a state formula: at a given time, either event2 occurs or event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted temporally: there exists some time (now or in the future) where C1 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / conclusion?
- Because event2 happened at t0, C1 is already true at t0 (event2 holds). Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied immediately. Even under a weaker reading where ""must happen"" means “will happen later” (not necessarily instantly), the alternation guarantees that at t0 or at some future time one of the two events occurs—indeed both will occur infinitely often. Thus C2 is True.

True

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (that is, at the start or in the actual run, event1 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is also terminal.
- Together, these rules mean you cannot have a run where event1 is followed by any other event, and likewise for event2. Because event1 has already occurred initially, no later events can occur in the actual run.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is simply the claim that event1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 ⇒ (not event1). Equivalently: whenever event2 occurs, event1 does not occur.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- From (1), event1 did happen, so C1 is false in the actual run.
- From (2), because event1 happened initially and is terminal, event2 cannot occur in the actual run (the antecedent of C2 is false).
- In standard (material) logic an implication with a false antecedent is true. Since event2 cannot happen in any continuation of the actual run, the statement ""if event2 happens then event1 does not happen"" is vacuously true in that run.
- Therefore, under the usual interpretation of ""if ... then ..."" (material implication) and given the stated facts, C2 is True.

Notes/alternatives:
- If you meant the conditional as a counterfactual or some stronger modality (e.g., “in any possible world where event2 happens, event1 does not happen”), you’d still get it true here because there is no possible continuation of the actual run where event2 happens. Only under nonstandard readings (e.g., treating the conditional as requiring a causal or explanatory relation independent of actual occurrences) might one reach a different judgment.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 has occurred in the actual run and, given the terminal rules, event2 cannot occur there, so the antecedent of ""if event2 happens then not event1"" is false. Under standard (material) implication a false antecedent makes the implication true (vacously true)."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 happens, no other events can happen (the state after event2 is terminal/no further events).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, event2 must happen at some later point.

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (i.e. event2 occurs in the state immediately following the current/initial state.)
- C2: “Event2 happens or C1 holds.” This is the logical OR of “event2 happens” and C1. (No C3 was given in the problem; only C1 and C2 are defined.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the truth values
- From the initial condition, event2 already happened in the current (initial) state.
- From Rule A, once event2 has happened the system is terminal, so nothing (including event2) can happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C2 is the disjunction “event2 happens OR C1”. Under the natural reading that the left disjunct “event2 happens” refers to the current/initial state (where event2 did happen), that disjunct is true, so C2 is true (true ∨ false = true).
- Note the possible ambiguity: if the phrase “Event2 happens” in C2 were intended to mean “event2 happens in the next state” (i.e. both disjuncts talk about the next state), then both disjuncts would be false and C2 would be false. But with the usual reading (one disjunct is the fact that event2 already happened initially), C2 is true.

Short answer: C1 is false. C2 is true under the natural interpretation (but would be false under the uncommon interpretation that both disjuncts refer to the next state).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 already occurred in the initial state, so the left disjunct of C2 is true (true ∨ false = true)."

Short answer: C2 is True (under the usual reading). Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (the negation of C1).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened and “after event2 no other events can happen,” no further events (including event1) can occur after event2.
- Assuming events are ordered and there is no earlier moment than the initial state (i.e., event1 cannot have happened before the given initial state, and we do not allow simultaneous occurrence unless stated), it is impossible for both event2 and event1 to have happened. Thus C1 is false, so C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

Note: If you allow event1 and event2 to occur simultaneously at the initial instant, then C1 could be true and C2 false. The conclusion above follows the typical temporal reading where “after X” forbids any later occurrence.

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual meaning of a ""next"" state).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Both rules say a terminal behavior: after event2 no other events can happen; likewise after event1 no other events can happen. So once either event occurs the system has no further event transitions (no successor states with further events).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — a proposition true in any state where either event1 or event2 has (already) happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the formula that C1 is true at the immediate successor state of the current state (the standard next-time operator).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- In the initial state C1 is true because event2 has happened.
- But because event2 makes the state terminal, there is no successor state in which to evaluate C1. Under the standard semantics for the next operator (which requires an actual successor state), ""next C1"" is false at a terminal state.
- Therefore C2 is False.

(If you use a nonstandard semantics where ""next"" is interpreted differently — e.g., vacuously true at terminal states or interpreted as ""in the current/unique continuation"" — the answer could change. Under the common semantics above, it is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 is true in the initial state (event2 has happened), but the state is terminal (no successor). Under the standard ""next"" semantics, ""next C1"" is false at a state with no successor."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur in the next state.
(Implicit assumption: events occur in discrete steps and we consider “after X” to mean “in the next state X′ must occur.” Also assume events are atomic per state, i.e. both don’t necessarily occur simultaneously unless stated.)

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — i.e. in the current state event1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e. in the state immediately following the current one, event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- In the initial state event1 did happen, so C1 is false in the initial state.
- Because “after event1, event2 must happen,” and event1 did happen initially, the next state must contain event2. Under the atomic-step assumption that event1 and event2 do not both occur in the same state, that means event1 does not happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Note: If your model allows event1 and event2 to occur simultaneously in a state, the conclusion could change; with the usual “next-state/alternation” reading, C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 happens, no further events can happen (the system is terminal after event1).
- After event2 happens, no further events can happen (terminal after event2 as well).

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e. in the state immediately after the initial one).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (a conditional: C1 ⇒ event1 happens).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the transition rule “after event1 no other events can happen” and the fact event1 already happened initially, the next state cannot have any events. So C1 is false: event1 does not happen in the next state.
- C2 is a material implication of the form (C1 ⇒ P) where P is “event1 happens.” In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Therefore C2 is true (vacuously), given C1 is false.

Note on interpretation: if you meant a different kind of implication (e.g., a causal/temporal guarantee rather than material implication) or intended the consequent to refer to a different time than the antecedent, clarify that and I can re-evaluate. Under the usual logical reading, C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0), event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — interpreted as: if event2 holds at state t, then event1 holds at the next state t+1.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — interpreted as: if event1 holds at some state t, then at the next state t+1 no events occur (neither event1 nor event2).

(Assuming a discrete-step semantics where ""after"" = ""in the next state"".)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Formally C1 = X(event1): at s0 this means event1 holds at s1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally C2 = X(C1) = X X(event1): at s0 this means event1 holds at s2.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From s0: event2 holds (given). By Rule A, event1 must hold at s1. Therefore C1 is true at s0.
- From s1: event1 holds. By Rule B, at s2 no events occur, so event1 does not hold at s2. Thus X X(event1) is false at s0.
- Therefore C2 is False.

(If you interpret ""no other events can happen"" differently—e.g., as banning only different events but allowing event1 to repeat—then the truth of C2 would be model-dependent. Under the natural reading above, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules?
- From event1: event2 must happen (i.e. if event1 occurs, the next step must include event2).
- From event2: no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So the possible execution/trace is: event1 (initial) → event2 → stop.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in every state/step regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This says that at some point in the future the formula C1 is true.

4) How do they relate and is C2 true or false?
- Because C1 is true at every point (it is a tautology), it already holds at the initial state. Therefore ""eventually C1"" is true (there exists a time — in fact every time — where C1 holds).
- Conclusion: C2 is True.

(If you intended a different reading of C1 — e.g. ""if event1 happens then event1 will happen later"" — say so and I’ll re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the current/initial state) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules:
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur in the next state.
These rules force the events to alternate from state to state.

3) What the sub-conditions mean:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — read as “in the current state, event2 does not occur.”
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state one step after the current state, event2 does not occur.

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- Timeline given the rules and the initial condition:
  - t0 (initial): event2 happens (given).
  - t1 (next): by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 happens at t1, so event2 does not happen at t1.
  - t2: event2 would happen again, and so on (alternation).
- Therefore C1 is false at t0 (because event2 does happen at t0).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds at t1; since event2 does not happen at t1, C2 is true.

Note: This conclusion assumes the rules enforce exclusive events per state (i.e., a state cannot simultaneously contain both event1 and event2). If simultaneous occurrence were allowed, you would need extra assumptions to decide.

Short answer: C2 is True (assuming the usual temporal reading that events are ordered and ""after"" means strictly later, not simultaneous). Now the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start (call that time t0).

2) What are the transition/temporal rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreted as: if event1 occurs at time t, then for any later time t' > t, no event (including event2) can occur.
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: if event2 occurs at time s, then there must exist a later time s' > s at which event1 occurs.

(If you allow simultaneous occurrences or a different interpretation of ""after"", see the note at the end — the conclusion can change only under those nonstandard readings.)

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" A claim about the system's actual behavior: there is no time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Means C1 is true in every possible situation/at all times (i.e., event2 never happens at any time).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event1 already happened at t0, Rule A forbids any events at any time t' > t0. So no event2 can occur after t0.
- There is no earlier time than t0 (t0 is initial), so event2 cannot have occurred before t0 either.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time → C1 is true.
- Since that conclusion follows from the given initial condition and rules for all future times, C1 holds always → C2 is True.

Note on ambiguity: If you allow simultaneous events (event2 occurring exactly when event1 occurs) or allow histories where event2 happened before the ""initial"" event1, the analysis could differ. Under the standard temporal reading implied by ""initially"" and ""after"" (strictly later, no simultaneous), C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False under the usual reading. Below I show the step-by-step reasoning and note the only ambiguity that could change the answer.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 has happened (so at the initial state event1 holds or the last transition was event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" I.e. as soon as event1 has occurred, there are no further event transitions (no next events). (This is the natural reading: event1 leads to a terminal situation with no further events.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" I.e. whenever event2 occurs, some later point must have event1 (a liveness requirement). (This rule only matters on traces where event2 occurs.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (Formally: at the current state, X(event1) — in the next state event1 holds.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (Formally: F(C1) — there exists some future state at which C1 is true; equivalently, at some future time the next state will have event1.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what is the truth value of C2?
- Starting point: event1 already happened in the initial state.
- By Rule A, after that occurrence of event1 no further events can happen. Therefore there is no future state in which an event occurs; in particular, there is no future state whose succeeding state contains event1.
- Thus C1 is false now (the next state does not contain event1), and because no events ever happen after the initial event1, C1 will never become true at any future point.
- Therefore C2 (""eventually C1"") is false.

Note on the only meaningful ambiguity:
- If Rule A were intended to mean ""after event1, no other events except event1 can happen"" (i.e., other events are disallowed but event1 may repeat), then the answer could change — in that alternate reading event1 might indeed happen in the next state, making C1 true immediately and hence C2 true. But with the ordinary interpretation of ""no other events can happen"" = no events at all after event1, C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already occurred and Rule A forbids any further events, so C1 (event1 in the next state) never becomes true and thus C2 (""eventually C1"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 happened (so E2 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After E2, E1 must happen (so once E2 occurs, E1 will occur later).
- After E1, no other events can happen (E1 is terminal).

From these rules we get the timeline: E2 happens initially, then E1 must happen, and then nothing further happens.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" = E2 ∨ E1.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = (E2 ∨ E1) ∨ E1.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- Logical simplification: (E2 ∨ E1) ∨ E1 = E2 ∨ E1 (idempotence of ∨). So C2 is logically equivalent to C1.
- Since E2 happened initially, E2 ∨ E1 is true, so C1 is true. Therefore C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is true (vacuously), while C1 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so event2 is true at the initial state).

2) Transition rules:
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"": whenever event1 occurs, event2 must also occur later (event1 ⇒ event2).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"": once event2 occurs it is terminal — no event1 (or any other event) can occur after that.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" That asserts event2 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" So C2 is the implication (event1 ⇒ not event2).

4) How they relate and truth values:
- From the initial condition, event2 did happen, so C1 is false.
- From ""after event2 no other events can happen"" and the fact event2 already happened initially, event1 cannot occur (there is no time after the initial event2 when event1 could happen). So in this model, event1 is impossible (¬event1 holds).
- A material implication with a false antecedent is true. Since event1 cannot happen, the antecedent of C2 is false, therefore the implication (event1 ⇒ not event2) is true in this model — C2 is true vacuously.
- Note: if you instead imagined a model where event1 could occur, C2 would conflict with the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (it would be false in any run where event1 happens). But given the actual context (initial event2 and terminality), event1 cannot happen, so C2 holds.

Conclusion: C1 is false; C2 is true (vacuously, because event1 never occurs under the given conditions).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (we start in a state ""after event1"").

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (So the state reached after event1 is terminal: no future events occur.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (Interpreted as: there is no occurrence of event2 in the relevant timeline; in particular no future occurrence.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (There exists some future time from which C1 is true — i.e., from some point onward event2 does not happen. If C1 is already true now, then C2 is satisfied.)

Step 4 — how they relate and verdict
- Because we start after event1 and rule A forbids any further events, event2 cannot occur at any future time. Therefore C1 is already true in the current/forward timeline.
- Since C1 holds now, ""C1 eventually holds"" is true as well.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

(If one allowed event2 to have occurred before the initial moment, then ""event2 does not happen"" interpreted as ""never happened at any time"" could be false; but under the presented reading—starting after event1 with no further events—C1 holds and so C2 is true.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (so event1 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means event1 is terminal: if event1 occurs, no event can occur at any later time.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Likewise, event2 would be terminal if it occurred.
- Because event1 happened initially, no other events can happen after that initial moment.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — formally ¬event2.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — formally event1 ∨ ¬event2 (a disjunction).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since event1 happened initially, event2 cannot occur afterward, and there was no earlier time for event2 to occur (event1 was the initial event). Therefore ¬event2 is true, so C1 is true.
- C2 is the disjunction event1 ∨ ¬event2. Here event1 is true (given) and ¬event2 is also true, so the disjunction C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False under the usual reading (events are instantaneous and ""always"" quantifies over time points). I’ll show the step-by-step reasoning and note the alternate reading that would make C2 true.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial time (t0) event2 happens.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" If event1 occurs at some time, then at some later time event2 must occur.
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Once event2 occurs, no further events (neither event1 nor event2 again) may occur after that point. So event2 is terminal.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" This is a proposition evaluated at a time point: at that time either event1 occurs or event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as the temporal formula Always(C1) — at every time point in the timeline, C1 must be true.

(There is no C3 given.)

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- At the initial time t0, event2 happens, so C1 is true at t0.
- By Rule B, no events occur after t0. For any later time t>t0, no event1 and no event2 occur at that time, so C1 is false at those times.
- Because C1 is false at times after t0, C2 = Always(C1) is false.

Alternate interpretation (why someone might disagree)
- If one reads ""event2 happened"" as making a persistent fact ""event2 has occurred"" that remains true at all later times, and reads C1 as ""event1 has happened or event2 has happened (at some time)"", then C1 would be true at every time (because event2 happened initially) and so C2 would be true. But this is a different reading (past-occurrence as a persistent predicate) than the standard instantaneous-event / pointwise temporal logic reading.

Conclusion: Under the standard instantaneous-event semantics used in temporal reasoning problems, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Under the usual instantaneous-event reading, C1 holds at t0 but fails at times after t0 (no events occur), so Always(C1) is false."

2) Transition rules

(These rules affect what happens after event1 but do not change whether event1 did or did not happen initially.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This asserts that C1 is false, i.e., ¬C1. Therefore C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 does happen.""

4) How they relate
- The initial condition states event1 happened → C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false.
- Since C2 asserts ¬C1, and C1 is false, C2 is true.

Step-by-step:

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state contains event1).
- After event1, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the possible execution sequence is: initial state with event2 → a state with event1 → termination.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" As a propositional implication this is the formula event1 → event1. That formula is a logical tautology (always true): its truth table gives true whether event1 holds or not. So C1 holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This says: at some state (now or later) the formula C1 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and is C2 true or false?
- Since C1 is a tautology, it is true in the initial state (and in every state). Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is true. Even under any reasonable temporal interpretation (including if ""eventually"" requires a future state), C1 also holds at the state where event1 occurs, so C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (in the initial state S0) event2 happened (event2 is true in S0).
- After event2, no other events can happen → from S0 the system goes to a state with no events and stays there.
- Also: after event1 no other events can happen → any state where event1 happens would also be terminal. (But in this model event1 never actually occurs because the initial fact is that event2 happened.)

2) Transition rules
- S0: event2 = true.
- S1: a terminal state with no events true (event1 = false, event2 = false).
- Transitions: S0 → S1, and S1 → S1 (stays terminal). There is no state where event1 occurs in this run.

3) Meanings of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting this as the temporal formula □ event2 (event2 holds at the current and all future states).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Interpreting this as X(□ event2) — i.e., in the immediate successor state, □ event2 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At S0: event2 is true, but in S1 event2 is false. So □ event2 is false at S0 (because it is not true at S1).
- At S1: event2 is false there and stays false, so □ event2 is also false at S1.
- Therefore C1 is false, and C2 = X(C1) is also false (C1 does not hold in the next state S1).

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If you meant a different formal reading of “always” or “next,” say so and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: In the next state S1 event2 is false, so □event2 is false there; therefore X(□event2) (C2) is false."

Short answer: C2 is False (assuming standard ""next"" semantics where there must be a successor state for Next to hold).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen: if event1 holds at a state, then the immediate successor state must have event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen: if event2 holds at a state, there is no successor state in which any event (event1 or event2) holds — in particular there is no successor state (or no successor in which any event occurs).

(Under the standard temporal logic reading “After X, Y must happen” means X ⇒ Next Y, and “no other events can happen after event2” means there is no successor state after a state where event2 holds.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is event2 ⇒ event2. This is a propositional tautology (p ⇒ p) and is true in every state where it is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally Next(C1). This is true at a state exactly when there is an immediate successor state and C1 is true at that successor.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true?
- C1 is true in every state (tautology).
- C2 requires a successor state. In the initial state event2 holds, and the rule “after event2 no other events can happen” means there is no successor state (or at least no successor where events occur). Under standard Next semantics, if there is no immediate successor, Next(C1) is false.
- Therefore C2 is False.

(If you adopt a nonstandard semantics that treats Next as vacuously true when there is no successor, or that allows a successor state where nothing happens, the answer could differ; under the usual semantics used in temporal logic, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

C1 (event2 ⇒ event2) is true in any state, but C2 = Next(C1) requires an immediate successor state where C1 holds. The initial state has event2 and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" means there is no successor state, so Next(C1) is false under the standard semantics."

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens” — i.e. E1 ∧ E2.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens” — i.e. (E1 ∧ E2) → E1.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- The implication (E1 ∧ E2) → E1 is a logical tautology: if both E1 and E2 are true, then E1 is certainly true. Even if E1 ∧ E2 were false, the implication would be true by vacuous truth. So C2 is always true.
- (Separately: given the scenario, event2 happened and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” makes E1 true as well, so C1 actually holds in this scenario; that only further confirms C2.)

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it time t0), event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs at some time t, then at a later time event2 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (If event2 occurs at time t, then for all times > t no events occur.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (Event1 occurs at time t1, the state immediately after the initial state t0.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (Event1 does not happen in the next state; i.e., C1 is false.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since event2 already happened at t0 (initially), Rule B prohibits any events after t0. The ""next state"" t1 is after t0, so no event (including event1) can occur at t1.
- Therefore C1 (event1 happens in the next state) is false.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- The events are event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the start, event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => likewise, once event1 occurs, no further events can occur after it.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant way of saying ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e. event1 does not happen.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and that prevents any other events from happening after it, event1 cannot happen at any later time. There is no indication event1 happened before the initial moment. So C1 is false (event1 does not happen), therefore C2 is true.

Note: if one allowed simultaneous occurrences at the initial moment (event1 and event2 both happening at the same instant), the conclusion could differ. Under the usual reading that ""initially event2 happened"" and the ""after"" rules forbid any subsequent events, C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurred initially and forbids any later events, so event1 cannot occur (making C1 false), hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Short answer: C2 is True (given the statements as written).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.

2) Transition rules / constraints:
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs the system becomes terminal (no further events).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Similarly, if event2 were to occur it would also be terminal.
- No other transitions are specified.

3) What the conditions mean:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreted as “in the actual timeline/truth of the system, event2 never occurs.”
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as “C1 is true at all times / globally (i.e., event2 never occurs at any point).”

4) How the conditions relate:
- Because event1 happened initially and event1 is terminal (no further events can happen after it), there is no moment at which event2 can occur. Therefore C1 is true in the actual run.
- Since event2 cannot occur at any later time in that run, C1 holds at all times in the run; thus C2 is true.

Note on alternative interpretations: If you interpret “always” as ranging over alternative possible histories/worlds (not the single given run), or allow simultaneous events, conclusions could differ. Under the plain reading given (initial event1, and after event1 nothing else can happen), C2 is True.

Answer (short): C2 is not true under the usual “there is a next state” reading of the next operator — C2 is False. Below is a step‑by‑step explanation and the alternative semantics note.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” Means any state where event1 occurred has no successors (it is terminal/deadlock).
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” Means any state where event2 occurred is terminal as well.
- In particular the initial state (where event2 happened) has no successors.

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting “always” as a global property (G event2) or “in every reachable state event2 holds”, C1 is true in the model because the only reachable state is the initial one and event2 holds there.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” This is the next-state operator applied to C1 (X C1), i.e. the claim that in the successor state(s) C1 is true.

4) How do the conditions relate and is C2 true?
- From (2) the initial state has no successor. Whether X C1 (C2) is true depends on the chosen semantics for “next”:
  - Under the usual LTL-style/“there exists a next state” reading of X (which requires an actual next state to evaluate the formula), X C1 is false when there is no next state. So C2 is False.
  - Under the CTL-style universal-next operator AX (“for all next states, C1 holds”), AX C1 is true in a state with no successors because the universal quantification over an empty set is vacuously true. So under that reading C2 would be True.

Practical takeaway: with the most common interpretation used in finite-trace or LTL settings (X requires a successor), C2 is False. If you meant the universal next (AX) and accept vacuous truth on deadlocks, C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so proposition ""event1 happens"" is true at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen — so once event1 occurs, event2 will occur at some later point.
- After event2, no other events can happen — event2 is terminal (nothing follows it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally, C1 is the implication event2 → event2. In classical logic this is a tautology (always true): any proposition implies itself.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Formally C2 = C1 ∨ event1. It's true if either C1 is true or event1 is true (or both).

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true or false?
- C1 is always true (tautology), independent of whether event2 actually occurs.
- Also, by the initial condition, event1 is true. So both disjuncts of C2 are true, but you only need one.
- Therefore C2 = (true) ∨ (true) = true.

Conclusion: C2 is True. (Note: even if the initial condition were different, C1 alone suffices to make C2 true because C1 is tautologically true.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we start in a state where event1 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., from the initial state there will be a future state in which event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some future point (possibly the next step) at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some future point the statement C1 will be true. (In temporal-logic notation: F C1.)
  Note: In standard temporal logic F(F φ) is equivalent to F φ, so ""eventually (eventually event2)"" is the same as ""eventually event2.""

4) How do these conditions relate?
- From the rules, since event1 has happened and event2 must follow, C1 is true (event2 will occur).
- Because C1 is already true (now), ""eventually C1"" is also true (something that is true now is certainly true at some future-or-current moment). By the F F φ ≡ F φ identity, C2 is equivalent to C1.

Conclusion: C1 is true, therefore C2 is true (under the usual interpretation that ""must happen"" guarantees the occurrence and ""eventually"" has the usual temporal meaning). If you intended a different semantics for ""must"" or ""eventually,"" say so and I can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: Under the usual temporal logic interpretation (F = ""eventually"", allowing the current state), C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") already holds in the initial state, so F C1 (C2) holds as well. Equivalently F F φ ≡ F φ. (If you use a nonstandard semantics that excludes the current state and event2 happens immediately with no intermediate state, you should state that and I can re-evaluate.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it already occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event2 → event1. This matches the given rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" so C1 is true under the stated rules.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Formally: event2 ∨ C1.
- (No C3 is defined in your hypothesis — only C1 and C2 are given.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth of C2
- From the initial condition, event2 happened, so the left disjunct of C2 (event2) is true.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true, so C2 is true.
- Additionally, because of the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" C1 is also true. But you don't need C1 to be true to make C2 true here — event2 alone already makes C2 true.

Short answer: C2 is True (given the stated initial condition).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the initial time).
- Additional facts: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. (Both events are terminal when they occur.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- The rules say that once either event1 or event2 occurs, no further events can occur afterwards. That prevents any later occurrence of an event after one has already happened, but does not affect the truth of propositions about events that may have happened in the past or at the initial time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally C1 is the implication event1 → event1, which is a logical tautology (always true). It does not assert that event1 actually happens; it only states a trivially true implication.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally C2 is C1 → event2. Since C1 is true (tautology), C2 is equivalent to just event2 (i.e., it requires event2 to be true).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 contributes no new factual information (it is always true).
- C2, because its antecedent (C1) is true, asserts event2. In this scenario event2 already holds (it happened initially), so C2 is satisfied.
- The “no other events after” rules do not negate C1 (a tautology) and do not conflict with C2 here because event2 already occurred initially.

Conclusion: Given C1 is true and event2 occurred initially, C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 (event1 → event1) is a tautology and thus true; C2 is C1 → event2, which therefore amounts to event2. Since event2 happened initially, C2 is true."

Short answer: C2 is True (given the rules are enforced). Below is the step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- “After event1, event2 must happen” — whenever event1 occurs, there must be a later occurrence of event2.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — whenever event2 occurs, there must be a later occurrence of event1.

(Interpreting “must happen” as a guaranteed liveness requirement that the system enforces.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This is just the same disjunct twice, i.e. equivalent to “Event2 happens.” (C1 holds at a time/state in which event2 has occurred.)
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” In temporal terms: at some future time (possibly now) C1 is true — equivalently, event2 will occur at some point in the future.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- We start with event1 having happened. By the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” there must be a future occurrence of event2. Therefore C1 (event2 happens) will become true, so C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is satisfied.
- Once event2 happens, the other rule requires a future event1, and so on; the rules force an alternating recurrence, but for the question asked it suffices that an event2 does occur after the initial event1.

Caveat: This conclusion assumes the rules are enforced liveness guarantees. If instead the rules are only desired properties that can be violated by the system, then you cannot conclude C2 with certainty. Under the natural interpretation that “must happen” means the system guarantees it, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 has happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees a future occurrence of event2, so C1 will hold at some future time and therefore C2 is satisfied (assuming the ""must"" is an enforced liveness guarantee)."

- From the context, p (""event1 happens"") is true (it happened initially), so C1 (¬p) is false.
- A conditional A → B is true whenever A is false (vacuous truth). So because C1 is false, the implication (¬p) → p is true.
- Equivalently, note (¬p) → p has the same truth value as p (truth table check): it is true exactly when p is true. Since p is true here, (¬p) → p is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Let p = ""event1 happens"". p is true (event1 happened). (¬p) → p is equivalent to p, so it is true."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: Initially, event1 happened (so at the start, event1 is true/occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal; nothing can occur after it.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; logically C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally C2 is (C1 → event1). Since C1 is equivalent to event1, C2 has the form (event1 → event1), which is a logical tautology (always true). Note also that an implication with a false antecedent would also be true, so C2 would be true regardless of whether C1 actually holds.

(There is no C3 given in the problem.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 simply asserts event1; given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2 asserts that C1 implies event1. Because C1 already is the same as event1, the implication is trivially true. So C2 is true (both logically and in this model).
- The other system rules are consistent with this: event1 happens initially and is terminal, so event2 never occurs (which makes the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" vacuously satisfied).

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is equivalent to ""event1"", so C2 is ""event1 → event1"", a tautology (and also true in the given model since event1 holds)."

Short answer: under the usual meaning “after” = “in the next state”, C2 is True. If you meant something else by C1 (or by “after”), see the two alternative interpretations at the end.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state S0, event1 has happened (event1 is true at S0).

2) What are the transition rules?
- “After event1, event2 must happen” — interpreted as: if event1 is true in state t then event2 must be true in state t+1.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — interpreted as: if event2 is true in state t then event1 must be true in state t+1.
- These two rules force an alternating pattern: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, …

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- The hypothesis as written: C1 = “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” That is logically equivalent to simply “event2 happens” (event2 ∧ event2 ≡ event2) unless you intended a different reading.  
- C2 = “C1 holds in the next state” = Next(C1). With the simple reading of C1 this is Next(event2).

4) How do they relate and is C2 true?
- At S0 we have event1. By the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 must hold at S1. So Next(event2) is true at S0. Therefore C2 is True under the natural “next-state” reading.

Alternative readings (brief):
- If by “after” you meant only “eventually later” (not necessarily in the immediate next state), Next(event2) need not be guaranteed; then C2 could be undetermined or false depending on the system’s allowed behaviors.
- If by C1 you actually meant “event2 holds in two consecutive states” (e.g. event2 at t and event2 at t+1), then the alternation rules prohibit consecutive event2s, so C1 would be false in any state and C2 would be false.

If you intended a different formal meaning for “after” or for C1, tell me that interpretation and I’ll re-evaluate.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (so at the initial timepoint event1 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"": whenever event1 occurs at some time t, event2 will occur at some time t' ≥ t (i.e., event1 guarantees a later occurrence of event2).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"": once event2 has occurred, the system reaches a terminal state and no further events (including event1) occur after that time.

One possible timeline consistent with these rules: event1 occurs initially, then event2 occurs later, and then nothing else happens.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally C1 is the implication (event1 → event1). This is a tautology: any proposition implies itself.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says the formula (event1 → event1) is true at every timepoint (i.e., globally).

(There is no C3 given in the hypothesis; if you intended another condition, please provide it.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth-value of C2
- For any proposition P, P → P is always true (truth table: when P is true, P→P is true; when P is false, P→P is also true). So C1 is true at any particular time.
- Therefore the statement that C1 ""always holds"" (C2) is also true in every possible state or timeline — the extra context/transition rules do not affect this tautology.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially. (So in the actual run/event trace event2 has occurred.)

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In propositional logic this is the implication event1 → event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" That is (event1 → event2) ∨ event1.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- In the actual situation event1 does not occur (event2 happened initially and both events are terminal, so no subsequent events occur).
- An implication A → B is true whenever A is false (vacuously true). Since event1 is false in the actual run, C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 = (C1) ∨ (event1) = True ∨ False = True.

Note on interpretation: This uses the standard material implication and the given initial/terminal facts. Even if you allowed simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment, event2 did happen, so C1 would still be satisfied in that case; hence C2 remains True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (the initial state/run includes event1).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
So once either event happens, the run ends—no further events after that event.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., in every possible run/trace, event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., it is not the case that event2 always happens (equivalently, there exists some run where event2 does not happen).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because the initial run already has event1 and event1 is terminal, no other events can occur in that run. In particular, event2 does not occur in the actual initial run. Therefore event2 does not occur in every run (so C1 is false).
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterward.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs afterward.)
- Together with the initial event1, these rules force an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (so both events occur, repeatedly).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is event2 → event2. That is a logical tautology (an implication of the form A → A) and is always true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires (a) event1 occurs and (b) C1 is true.

4) How they relate and final verdict
- From (1) we know event1 did happen initially, so the first conjunct of C2 is satisfied.
- From (3) C1 is always true.
- Therefore both parts of C2 hold, so C2 is True.

Short answer: Under the natural reading of the context, C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, there are no further events/transitions.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, it is followed by event1.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is a property evaluated at some state S: it is true at S iff the immediate successor state of S contains event1.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This means there exists some reachable state S' (now or later) such that at S' the property C1 is true (i.e., from S' the next state has event1).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C2?
- Because event1 already happened initially and Rule A forbids any further events after event1, there are no successor states that contain any event. In particular, there is no state S' that has a successor state containing event1. Therefore C1 is false at every reachable state, so there is no state where C1 holds, and hence C2 is false.
- Rule B is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1 (Rule A prevents any events after the initial event1), so it never forces anything.

Note on ambiguity: If one instead reads ""After event1, no other events can happen"" as “no other (different) events can happen but event1 may repeat,” then the system could allow event1 again in the next state, making C1 true (immediately) and thus C2 true. Under the usual plain reading that no further events at all occur after event1, C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already happened and Rule A forbids any further events, so no reachable state has a successor with event1 (C1 is never true), hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

Summary answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., event1 will occur following event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant way of saying ""Event1 happens."" C1 holds exactly when event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means at some (possibly immediate) point in the future, C1 becomes true — equivalently, event1 will occur at some time.

4) How do these conditions relate and final conclusion?
- Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will indeed occur (and then nothing else happens).
- Therefore C1 is true (event1 happens).
- Consequently, C2 — that C1 eventually holds — is true as well.

So C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it is true initially).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen — event1 is terminal.
- After event2, event1 must happen — whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.

Given the initial event2, the allowed timeline is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is p → p, which is a tautology (always true). In the concrete timeline event2 does happen, so C1 is certainly true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This is the disjunction (event1) ∨ (C1).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the transition rules and the initial condition, event1 does occur after event2, so the left disjunct of C2 is true.
- Independently, C1 is a tautology and therefore true.
- A disjunction with at least one true disjunct is true, so C2 is true (in fact both disjuncts are true here).

Note: under the usual (material) interpretation of ""if ... then ..."" C1 is always true; only an exotic nonstandard interpretation of implication could make C1 questionable. Under the given description, C2 is definitely true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur sometime afterward.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime afterward.
- With event2 true at the start, these rules force an alternating sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... (so both events occur, in fact infinitely often under these rules).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" This is true if at least one of the two events occurs (now or at some time you quantify over). Given the stated facts, event2 already happened, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" This is the disjunction of C1 with event2.

- Logically, C2 = (C1) OR (event2). But C1 itself is (event1 OR event2). So C2 = (event1 OR event2) OR event2, which by absorption/simplification is just (event1 OR event2) — i.e., C2 is equivalent to C1.
- Since event2 has already happened, C1 is true, therefore C2 is true as well. Even without that, because event2 is explicitly part of C2, C2 would be true whenever event2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the logical negation of C1, i.e., ""it is not the case that event2 does not happen"" — equivalently, ""event2 does happen.""

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- The initial condition states event2 happened, so the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore its negation (C2) is true.

So C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (i.e., at time 0).

2) Transition/temporal rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, the system enters a state in which no further events (neither event1 nor event2) can occur afterwards.
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That means if event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur.

(Assumption made: ""after"" is temporal/future — i.e., ""after X"" means at times strictly later than the occurrence of X.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This asserts that there exists some future time when event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Equivalently, ""Event2 does not eventually happen"" (negation of C1).

4) How the conditions relate under the rules
- Because the initial state already has event1 occur, Rule A immediately forbids any events happening later. So no event can occur after the initial event1.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No — the word ""initially"" means the history begins with event1 having happened; there is no earlier time in the scenario for event2 to occur.
- Also, if one tried to let event2 happen after the initial event1, Rule B would require a subsequent event1, but Rule A forbids any event after event1, so that would be impossible. Thus event2 cannot occur in any timeline consistent with both rules and the initial condition.

Conclusion
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"" / ""event2 does not eventually happen"") is true.

Short answer: C2 is True — it follows from the context.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so in the initial state S0, event1 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. Interpreted as: whenever event1 occurs in a state, in the immediately following state event2 occurs.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 leads to a terminal state with no further events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This asserts that in the state immediately following the current one, event2 holds.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication: whenever event1 occurs in a state, event2 will be true in the next state.
- (No C3 was defined in the hypothesis.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From Rule A, whenever event1 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state. That is exactly what C2 states (event1 ⇒ event2-in-next-state). So Rule A entails C2.
- Given the initial condition that event1 happened in the initial state, Rule A also entails C1 for the initial step (event2 will occur in the next state).
- Rule B just says no further events occur after that, and does not contradict the above.

Therefore C2 is true (it is entailed by the given transition rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"").

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the context rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is exactly the statement of C2 (event1 ⇒ event2 in the next state), so C2 is entailed by the given rules."

Answer (short): C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events are mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initially (in the current/initial state s0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- “After event2, no other events can happen” — once event2 has occurred, no events occur in any later state.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — if event1 occurs, likewise no events occur later. (This second rule is irrelevant here because event1 never occurred.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state (call it s1), event2 occurs.
- C2: “Event2 happens or C1 holds” — a disjunction: either event2 happens (in the initial/current state) or C1 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At s0, event2 already happened, so the left disjunct of C2 (“Event2 happens”) is true at s0. Therefore C2 is true at s0 regardless of C1.
- C1 is false: because event2 happened at s0 and the rule “after event2, no other events can happen” means no events (including event2) occur in the next state s1.
- So C1 = False, C2 = True.

(If you intended a different temporal reading of “Event2 happens” in C2, tell me which timepoint you mean and I’ll re-evaluate.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the start of the execution/trace event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal (if it occurs, the trace ends).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal (if it occurs, the trace ends).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted in the usual way: in the (given) execution(s) under these rules, event1 occurs (or occurs on every possible trace).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" The negation of C1.

Step 4 — relation and conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal (no events can happen after it), no other events (including event1) can occur in that execution. Therefore event1 does not happen.
- So C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

True

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event2 happens (event2 is true in s0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen: so from s0 the next state s1 has event1 true.
- After event1, no other events can happen: after s1 there are no states with any event true (either the system halts or later states have neither event1 nor event2).

A possible timeline: s0: event2 true → s1: event1 true → s2: no events true (or no further states).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" As a propositional formula this is event2 → event2. That is a tautology (p → p is always true regardless of whether p is true or false).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks: in the state s1 (the state immediately after s0), is the formula C1 true?

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Since C1 is a tautology, it is true in every state. Concretely, in s1 event2 is false (because s1 has event1), but event2 → event2 with a false antecedent is true. Therefore C1 holds in s1.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.

Note on possible ambiguity: If you intended C1 to mean a temporal claim like ""if event2 happens now then event2 happens in the next state,"" that would be a different formula (a next-time implication) and would be false here because event2 does not hold in s1. But as written, C1 is the non-temporal tautology event2 → event2, so C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is True (under the usual reading). Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. Interpreted as: if event2 occurs in state n, then event1 occurs in state n+1.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. Interpreted as: if event1 occurs in state n, then event2 occurs in state n+1.

(Assumption: “after” means in the next state, and events are considered per-state occurrences. If events could co-occur in the same state or “after” had a different meaning, conclusions might change.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (A proposition about a given state: it is true in a state iff event1 does not occur in that state.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” In other words, from the current state s, C2 asserts that in s+1 event1 does not happen.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and evaluation)?
- Start at s0: event1 happened, so C1 is false at s0.
- By Rule B (after event1 → event2), in s1 event2 must happen.
- In s1 event2 happens and event1 does not; therefore C1 is true in s1.
- C2 says “C1 holds in the next state (s1)”; since C1 is true in s1, C2 is true when evaluated at s0.

Conclusion: C2 is True (given the usual next-state reading of “after”).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0) event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
So the system alternates: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, … (and so on).

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (Interpreted as “there exists some state at or after the current state where event1 holds.”)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” i.e. at the state immediately after the current one, it is true that event1 will eventually happen from that point on.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- At state0, event1 already holds, so C1 is true at state0.
- At the next state (state1) event2 holds, but by the alternation rule event1 will occur in state2. Thus from state1 there is a future state (state2) where event1 holds, so “event1 eventually happens” is true at state1.
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

(If you interpret “eventually” to exclude the current state, the conclusion is the same here because event1 reoccurs in state2.)

Short answer: C2 is True under the natural reading that “happens” means “has occurred (at some point in the run)”. If you instead mean “will happen in the future,” then C2 would be False. Below are the step-by-step details and both interpretations.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred the system stays in a state with no further events.)
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur subsequently).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens or event2 happens.” I.e., at least one of the two events occurs at some point in the execution/run.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” I.e., at every reachable state (or at all times) the statement C1 is true.

(If you instead interpret “happens” as “will happen in the future from the current state,” then C1 would mean “either event1 will happen later or event2 will happen later,” which changes the answer — see note below.)

4) How the conditions relate and final verdict
- Because event1 has already happened initially, C1 is true immediately (event1 has occurred).
- The rule “after event1 no other events can happen” prevents any further events, so the system never reaches a state in which neither event has ever occurred. The truth of “event1 has happened” persists, so C1 remains true in all states.
- Therefore C2 (“C1 always holds”) is True under the usual reading that “happens” means “occurs at some point (past or present) in the run.”

Alternative reading (future-only “happens”): If C1 is read as “event1 will happen later or event2 will happen later”:
- Right after the initial occurrence of event1 there are no future events (because no events can happen after event1), so neither “event1 will happen later” nor “event2 will happen later” is true. Then C1 would be false at that point and C2 would be False. 

Which interpretation you want will determine the final answer; the natural/common interpretation (has happened at some time) makes C2 True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: with the natural reading that ""happens"" means ""has occurred,"" event1 has already occurred and no further events can undo that, so C1 holds in every state and thus C2 is True. (Under the future-only reading, C2 would be False.)"

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen.
Both rules mean each of event1 and event2 is terminal: once either has occurred, no further events can occur afterward.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (a claim about the whole scenario)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (a logical disjunction: event1 occurs OR event1 does not occur)

4) How they relate and truth values
- Since initially event2 already happened and event2 is terminal (no other events can happen after it), no other events can occur after the initial moment. Therefore event1 cannot occur. So C1 is True.
- C2 is a disjunction (event1 happens) OR (C1). A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Since C1 is True, C2 is True regardless of whether ""event1 happens"" is true (it's not).

Conclusion: C1 = True, and therefore C2 = True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Hence the only allowed infinite execution is the alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (starting with event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Read naturally as a global invariant: every time event1 occurs it is followed by an occurrence of event2 (in this system that will be the next event).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Read as there exists some time from which C1 is true (or equivalently: at some future point C1 becomes true, and thereafter holds).

Step 4 — how they relate and the truth value of C2
- Because the transition rules force strict alternation, whenever event1 occurs it is immediately followed by event2. Therefore C1 is already true from the start (it holds for every occurrence of event1).
- Since C1 holds immediately, it certainly ""eventually holds"" as well.

Conclusion: C2 is True. (Under the natural interpretation above; if you meant different temporal semantics for ""C1"" or ""eventually,"" let me know and I can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C2 is False (assuming the usual “next” operator is false when there is no successor state).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen — the state reached by event1 is terminal (no successor).
- After event2, no other events can happen — any state reached by event2 would also be terminal.

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a proposition evaluated at a state; given the initial state where event1 happened, C1 is true now.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this is the temporal next operator X C1 (true iff there is a successor state and C1 holds there).

4) How do they relate?
- In the initial state C1 is true (because event1 happened).
- But the initial state is terminal (no next state), so X C1 is false under standard semantics (next requires an actual successor).
- Therefore C2 is false. (If you adopt a different semantics that treats terminal states as self-looping/stuttering states, the answer could differ; under the usual interpretation, C2 = False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Justification: C1 is true in the initial state (event1 happened), but the initial state is terminal (no successor), so the ""next"" operator X C1 is false under the usual semantics that require an actual successor state."

Summary answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs following event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the actual execution sequence is: event2 happens, then event1 happens, then nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is redundant but logically equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (p ∨ p ≡ p).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally C2 is (event2) → C1. Substituting the simplification of C1 gives (event2) → (event2), i.e. p → p.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 is true in the given context because event2 does happen initially.
- C2 is the implication p → p, which is a tautology (always true). Concretely, in the given scenario its antecedent is true and its consequent is true, so the implication is true; even in any other scenario it would be true (if the antecedent were false the implication would be vacuously true).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e., at the initial time/state event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Given the initial condition (event2 already happened), no further events can occur after the initial state.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just the conjunction of the same proposition with itself, so C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This states that at some time (now or in the future) C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- Since event2 holds at the initial state, C1 is true at the initial state.
- Therefore C1 holds at some time (indeed immediately), so ""eventually C1"" is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Note: This assumes ""eventually"" allows the current moment (standard F in LTL, which means at some k ≥ 0). If you interpret ""eventually"" strictly as a later time (k > 0) and disallow the current moment, then C2 would be false because no further events can occur after the initial event2. Under the usual (non-strict) semantics, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 holds in the initial state, so C1 (equivalent to event2) is true immediately; hence ""eventually C1"" is true under the standard (non-strict) semantics where ""eventually"" includes the current time."

I'll go step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is given as ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this just reduces to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens,"" i.e. logically: (event2 happens) → (event1 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and truth values)?
- Because event1 happened initially and event1 is terminal, no other events can occur after that; in particular, event2 cannot occur at any later time. Since event1 was the initial event, there is no earlier time for event2 to have happened, so event2 does not happen in this scenario. Thus C1 (""event2 happens"") is false.
- The conditional C2 (""if event2 happens then event1 happens"") is true in standard logic for one of two reasons:
  1. Vacuously: an implication with a false antecedent is true, and here event2 does not happen, so the antecedent is false.
  2. Also, independently, event1 actually does happen (initially), so the consequent is true as well — which makes the implication true in any case.

Conclusion: C2 is True. (C1 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is false (event2 does not happen), so the implication (event2 → event1) is vacuously true; additionally event1 is actually true, so the consequent holds as well."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial point in time).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., any execution that has event1 must later perform event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — nothing follows it).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
There is a small ambiguity in the natural language of C1/C2, so I give the two standard readings:

A. ""Occurrence"" reading (typical liveness reading)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" means: in every possible run/execution, event2 occurs at some time (i.e., event2 inevitably occurs; formally, F event2 holds on every run).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" under this reading is a bit redundant: if C1 is a global statement about all runs, saying ""C1 eventually holds"" usually means ""at some time in the future it becomes true that event2 will occur (in every continuation)"". But often people mean simply ""event2 eventually occurs.""

B. ""State/always"" reading (safety/always)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" interpreted as ""event2 holds at all times"" (G event2), i.e., from now on event2 is always true (this is strong and usually not intended for instantaneous events).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" = eventually it will become the case that event2 holds at all future times (i.e., F G event2).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value of C2

Under the natural liveness interpretation (A):
- Because event1 has already happened and the rule requires event2 after event1, event2 will occur in every execution. So C1 (event2 occurs) is true.
- Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true (indeed C1 already holds now).

Under the state/always interpretation (B):
- Event2 is an event (an occurrence), not a state that is true at all times. Before event2 occurs, event2 is not true; after it occurs, no further events happen but that does not usually make the atomic proposition ""event2"" true forever (unless you redefine it as a persistent state). So C1 (G event2) is false.
- Consequently C2 (F G event2) is also false under this reading.

Summary / Answer to your question
- If C1 means ""event2 will occur (at least once) in every run"" — the standard reading — then C2 is True.
- If C1 means ""event2 is true at every moment from now on"" (a persistence reading), then C2 is False.

Most people reading your English description mean the liveness reading, so the practical answer is: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Additional constraint: after event2, no other events can happen (so event1 does not and cannot occur after the initial event2).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (This is a rule/implication: event1 → event2.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the rule A (the implication event1 → event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" That is the disjunction (C1) ∨ (event1 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate and which is true?
- From the problem statement, C1 is true (it is given as a rule, and even if event1 never occurs the implication is vacuously true).
- In the actual timeline event2 already happened first, so event1 does not happen (the second disjunct is false).
- C2 is a disjunction with a true left disjunct (C1), so C2 is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Therefore C2 is True.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So once event2 has happened, no further events (including event1) can occur.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Symbolically: (C1) → event1, i.e. (event2 → event1) → event1.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the context: event2 is true and event1 is false (because after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 did not happen).
- Evaluate C1 = (event2 → event1). Since antecedent true and consequent false, C1 is false.
- Evaluate C2 = (C1 → event1). In standard (material) propositional logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true (vacuously true).

Note: If you intended a non-material or causal interpretation of ""if...then"" (e.g., ""if C1 were true then that would cause event1 now""), the judgment about C2 could differ; under the causal reading C2 would not make event1 true because C1 does not actually hold.

4) How do they relate?
- Because event1 has already happened and Rule A says no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen next), so C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

Step-by-step answer.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So starting from the initial event2 you get event1 next, then event2, then event1, … (they alternate, so both will occur repeatedly).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is the implication event1 → event1. As a propositional implication it is always true (a tautology): an implication p → p is true for every truth value of p.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that the statement C1 is true at all times (or in all states).

(There is no C3 given.)

4) How these conditions relate and final answer
- Because C1 is a logical tautology (event1 → event1 is always true), C1 holds at every time/state regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Note: If you intended a temporal reading like ""if event1 happens now then event1 happens next"" (next(event1)), or ""if event1 happens then event1 will eventually happen,"" those are different formulas and would need separate analysis. As written, C1 is the trivial reflexive implication, so C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Step‑by‑step:

1) Events and initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules: event2 → event1 and event1 → event2, so events alternate (event2, event1, event2, ...).

3) Meaning of C1: C1 is ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (event1 → event1). As a propositional implication p → p this is a tautology and is true in every state.

4) C2 is ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it holds at every time/state.

Final answer: True

(If C1 were intended as a temporal claim like ""event1 now → event1 next"" then the truth value could differ; as written, C1 is the trivial reflexive implication.)"

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. at the start event1 is true).
- Additional rules: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So each of event1 and event2 is terminal: once either occurs, no further events can occur.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 block any subsequent events.
- Because event1 happened initially, no other events can happen after that moment. Therefore, under the given timeline/event-ordering, event2 cannot occur after event1. (Unless one allows simultaneous occurrences or a different temporal reading — under the usual sequential reading event2 cannot also occur.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (E2 ∧ E1).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" ( (E2 ∧ E1) → E1 ).

4) How they relate
- Logically, (E2 ∧ E1) → E1 is valid: from a conjunction you can always infer one conjunct. So C1 implies event1 by conjunction-elimination; therefore C2 is true as a logical implication.
- Also, given the context C1 is impossible (because event1 occurs initially and blocks further events, so both cannot occur in sequence), so C1 is false in the model; an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Either way, C2 holds.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1, then termination).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Standard temporal reading: there exists some time >= now at which event2 occurs. (In most temporal logics ""eventually"" includes the current moment.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 ⇒ (eventually event2).

4) How they relate and why C2 is true
- Because event2 has already happened initially, C1 is true in the system.
- More generally, the implication in C2 is tautological under the usual semantics: if event2 holds at some time, then there exists a time (that same time) at which event2 holds, so ""eventually event2"" is satisfied. Thus event2 ⇒ eventually event2 is always true.
- The transition rules (that event2 is followed by event1 and then termination) do not contradict this; they don't prevent the implication from holding.

Note on semantics: If you intended ""eventually"" to mean ""at some strictly later time (excluding the present moment)"", then an occurrence of event2 only at time 0 would not satisfy that stricter C1. Under that strict interpretation C2 could fail. Under the standard inclusive interpretation above, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Under the usual (non‑strict) reading of ""eventually"" (exists time t' ≥ now), if event2 holds at the current time then ""eventually event2"" holds (take t' = now), so event2 ⇒ eventually event2 is a tautology. (If you mean ""eventually"" as strictly later, the implication can fail.)"

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., at the start/eventually, event1 occurs).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event1 must also occur—this rule is irrelevant here unless event2 occurs).

3) Meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This asserts that event1 does not occur.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event1 does happen.""

4) How they relate and evaluation
- The context explicitly states event1 happened initially, so the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore C2, which asserts that C1 does not hold, is true.
- The transition rules don't create any contradiction: because event1 already happened, Rule A simply prevents other events from happening afterward (so event2 cannot occur), and Rule B is irrelevant (it only applies if event2 happens).

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After E2, E1 must happen. (So E2 implies that E1 will occur.)
- After E1, no other events can happen. (E1 is terminal but does not prevent E1 itself.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just E1 ∨ E1, which is logically equivalent to E1.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — formally C1 → E1. Rewriting using C1 ≡ E1 gives E1 → E1.

4) How they relate and truth value
- From the context, E2 happened and ""after E2, E1 must happen"", so E1 does indeed happen. Thus C1 is true.
- The implication C2 reduces to E1 → E1, which is a tautology (always true). Even without using the context, any proposition implies itself, so C2 is true; given the context it is also satisfied because E1 holds.

So C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start, event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition / temporal rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, there are no further events afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs at some point, then event1 must occur (the phrasing is ambiguous about order, but the natural reading is that event2 implies that event1 will (or has) occur; in any case it enforces a link between event2 and event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology (p → p), so it is true in every state: if event2 holds then it holds, and if it doesn't hold the implication is still true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asks whether C1 is true at all times / in all reachable states.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because C1 is a tautology, it is true in every possible state or trace regardless of the transition rules or whether event2 ever occurs. Therefore C1 does indeed hold always.
- Conclusion: C2 is True.

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start/time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 will occur next/at some later point).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 is followed by event2).
- Together these force an alternating sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → …

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant disjunction; it simplifies to “Event1 happens.”
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — this means “Event1 does not happen.”

4) How they relate and final truth value
- Since event2 has happened and the rules force an event1 after event2, event1 will indeed happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 asserts the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

So C2 is False. (If you intended a different formulation for C1, tell me and I can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C2 is False (given the usual reading that events are occurrences tied to a state and do not automatically reoccur in the next state). Below are the step‑by‑step answers.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0), event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences in subsequent states).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction; logically C1 ≡ (event1). It is true in a state exactly when event1 happens in that state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, in the immediate successor state (S1), C1 should be true — equivalently, event1 should happen in S1.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- In S0 event1 happened, so C1 is true in S0.
- By Rule A, after event1 no other events can happen. That means in the next state S1 there are no event occurrences (including event1), so event1 does not happen in S1. Therefore C1 is false in S1.
- C2 claims C1 holds in the next state; since C1 is false in S1, C2 is false.

Note on alternate semantics: If you instead interpret ""event1 happens"" as a persistent proposition that stays true forever once true, then C1 would be true in S1 and C2 would be true. But under the usual interpretation that events are occurrences tied to particular states and do not automatically persist, C2 is False.

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it S0) event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
So the system forces an alternating sequence of events: starting S0: event1, then S1: event2, then S2: event1, then S3: event2, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Concretely, C1 asserts that at S1 (the state immediately after the current one) event1 occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a material implication with antecedent C1 and consequent ""event1 happens."" Two possible readings:
  a) If taken literally as written, the consequent is the same proposition as the antecedent (both assert ""event1 happens in the next state""), so C2 is equivalent to C1 → C1, which is a tautology (always true).
  b) If the consequent was intended to mean ""event1 happens (now, in the current state)"" then C2 is the claim ""if event1 happens next, then event1 happens now"" — a different and generally false claim in this system.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- From the alternation rule and the initial event1 at S0, the next state S1 must contain event2. Therefore C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false in this scenario.
- Evaluating C2 as the literal implication ""if C1 then event1 (next)"": since the antecedent C1 is false, the implication C2 is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true). Also, if interpreted as C1 → C1, it is trivially true.
- If instead C2 was intended to mean ""if event1 happens next then event1 happens now"", that would be false in this scenario.

Short answer to your question as stated: C2 is True (vacuously true under the natural reading where both antecedent and consequent refer to ""event1 happens in the next state"").

Short answer: C2 is True (given the usual reading that the disjunction uses the current-state occurrence of event2).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state S0, event2 happened (event2 is true at S0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 is true in some state, then event1 is true in the next state.
- After event1, event2 must happen → if event1 is true in some state, then event2 is true in the next state.
- So the system alternates: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Evaluated at S0, C1 asks whether event2 is true in S1. From the transition rules, S1 has event1, not event2, so C1 is false at S0.
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens.” (Natural reading: C2 = (C1) OR (event2 happens now/in the current state).)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- At S0: event2 happens (given). C1 is false (event2 is not in S1). C2 = C1 OR event2_current = false OR true = true.
- Thus C2 is True at the initial state.

(If you intended a different reading — e.g., the second disjunct in C2 means “event2 happens in the next state” as well — then C2 would just be equivalent to C1, and its truth would equal whatever C1 is. State which temporal reference you mean if you want that variant evaluated.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start (time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
So any run that takes either event is immediately stuck after that event.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is ambiguous; two natural readings:
  A. Run-level reading: “Event2 happens in every run” (i.e., event2 occurs at least once on every possible execution).  
  B. Temporal/global reading: “At every time point, event2 holds” (in LTL terms: G(event2), event2 is true forever).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Means there is some time point in the run after which C1 is true (i.e., eventually the property C1 becomes true and remains true thereafter).

4) How they relate and final answer
- Under reading A (run-level): C1 is true because event2 already occurred initially in the only (given) run; therefore C2 is also true (it already holds immediately).
- Under reading B (temporal/global): C1 is false — event2 only happened at the initial step and does not hold at later time points, so it is not true at all times. Consequently C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") is false as well (there is no future point from which event2 holds at every moment).

Likely intended (standard temporal interpretation where “always” means “at every time”) — C1 is false, so C2 is false. If instead “always” was intended to mean “happens in every run” then C1 and hence C2 are true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step‑by‑step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (time 0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (i.e. once event1 has occurred, no further events occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (i.e. if event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) What the sub‑conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" — a statement about the immediate successor state: from the current state, event1 occurs in the next state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — for every reachable state, C1 is true; equivalently, in every state the next state has event1.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- From Rule A and the initial condition: event1 occurred initially, and after event1 no further events occur. So in the immediate next state there are no events (in particular, event1 does not occur again). Thus C1 is false at the initial state.
- If C1 is false in at least one state (the initial state), then ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

(If you meant the rules differently — e.g. ""no other events"" means ""no events other than event1"" so event1 might be allowed to repeat — the conclusion can change. Under the usual reading that Rule A forbids any events after event1, C2 is definitely false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Since event1 already occurred and Rule A forbids any events afterwards, event1 does not occur in the next state, so C1 is false in the initial state; hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0) event2 happened (so event2 is true at state 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen: if event1 is true in some state, then in the next state event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen: if event2 is true in some state, then in the next state event1 is true.
- Starting from state 0 where event2 holds, the next state (state 1) must have event1. The system alternates: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally C1 is event1 -> event1. This is a propositional tautology (p -> p), hence true in every state regardless of whether event1 is true or false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the formula Next(C1) (or X C1): evaluate C1 in the state immediately following the current one.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Since C1 is a tautology, it is true in every state, in particular it is true in the next state (state 1).
- Therefore Next(C1) (C2) is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True. (If you used a nonstandard logic where implication isn't the usual material implication, tell me which semantics and I can re-evaluate.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (it happened initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- If event2 occurs, no other events can occur after it (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” Given event2 already happened initially, C1 is true (event2 has occurred at some point).
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” This is just the conjunction of “event2 eventually happens” and “event2 happens.” Both conjuncts are true here.

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Since event2 already occurred, C1 is true and the plain statement “event2 happens” is true, so their conjunction C2 is true.
- Note on ambiguity: if you interpret “eventually” to mean “at some strictly later time from now,” then because event2 is terminal and already occurred there can be no future occurrence and C1 (and hence C2) would be false. Under the standard reading that counts the already-occurring event2 as satisfying “eventually happens,” C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, the trace ends — there are no subsequent events.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, it must be followed later by event1.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (No occurrence of event2 anywhere in the trace.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (The property C1 is true at all times / in all possible executions — i.e., event2 never occurs in any execution.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- Because the initial condition is that event1 happened, and Rule A forbids any event after event1, there is no point at which event2 can occur in the execution. Therefore C1 is true in this execution (event2 does not happen).
- Since the rules and the initial condition already forbid any occurrence of event2 in any allowed execution, the statement ""C1 always holds"" is true — there is no permitted behavior where event2 happens. Rule B is vacuously satisfied (it only constrains traces where event2 occurs, but none exist).

Therefore C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 occurs initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, so no execution can contain event2. Therefore C1 (event2 does not happen) holds in every allowed execution, so C2 is true. Rule B is vacuously satisfied."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards.)
These rules make the two events alternate: event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly Rule B (after event1, event2 must happen).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is the disjunction of the factual claim ""event2 happens"" and the implication C1.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- C1 is true because the context explicitly states “after event1, event2 must happen,” which is the same as C1.
- Also, event2 actually happens initially (given). Therefore the disjunction in C2 is satisfied in at least two ways: event2 happens is true, and C1 is true. Either way makes C2 true.

1) Events and initial conditions

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, the next step has event1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — whenever event1 occurs, the next step has event2.
So the rules force event1 and event2 to alternate in time: starting from event1, event2 will occur next, then event1, then event2, etc.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — both events occur (reading could mean ""both occur at some times"" or ""both hold at the same time""; see note below).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — logically C2 = (C1) ∨ event1 = (event2 ∧ event1) ∨ event1.

Simplification: (event2 ∧ event1) ∨ event1 is equivalent to event1 (because X ∨ (X ∧ Y) = X).

4) How they relate and final answer
- Since C2 is equivalent to event1, and event1 is true initially, C2 is true (at the initial moment).
- Remarks about C1: if ""happens"" means ""occurs at some time (ever)"", then C1 is also true (both events occur over time due to the alternating rules).

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (A conditional: C1 ⇒ event2.)

- C1 contradicts the given context: the context says event2 did happen, so C1 is false in the given situation.
- C2 is a material implication. In classical logic an implication A ⇒ B is true whenever A is false (vacuous truth) or B is true. Here we actually have both: A (C1) is false, and B (event2 happens) is true.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So any state reached by event1 is terminal (no further events).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So any state reached by event2 is also terminal.
- Because event1 already happened initially, event2 cannot occur later in this run (no transitions from the state where event1 has happened).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a disjunction that is true in any state where at least one of the two events has occurred.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some point in the execution (now or later) at which C1 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C2 true or false?
- Since event1 already happened in the initial state, C1 is true right now (the disjunction is satisfied by event1).
- Standard temporal logic semantics for ""eventually"" (F) allows the current state to satisfy ""eventually"". Therefore C2 is true: C1 holds at the initial state, so it already (eventually) holds.
- Caveat: if you insist on an interpretation of ""eventually"" that excludes the current moment and requires a strictly later state, then C2 would be false, because no later state exists (the state after event1 is terminal), so C1 would not occur strictly in the future. Under the usual (inclusive) meaning of ""eventually,"" C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- The events are event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After an occurrence of event1, event2 must occur next.
- After an occurrence of event2, event1 must occur next.
Together these force alternation: whenever one event occurs the other must occur immediately afterwards.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreting naturally, C1 asserts that event2 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This means there is some time after which C1 is true — i.e. from some point onward event2 never occurs.

(If instead C1 were read as “event2 does not happen at the current moment,” C2 would mean “at some moment event2 is not happening.” That weaker reading is irrelevant here because of the stronger, standard reading used below.)

4) How they relate / conclusion
- From the initial event1 and the transition rules, the sequence of events is forced to be: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... — event2 occurs repeatedly.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 never occurs"") is false.
- Consequently C2 (""event2 never occurs from some point onward"") is also false: there is no time after which event2 stops occurring.

So C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the initial event1 and the rules forcing immediate alternation (event1 → event2 → event1 → ...), event2 occurs repeatedly (infinitely often). Thus C1 (""event2 never occurs"") is false, and C2 (""event2 never occurs from some point onward"") is also false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so event2 → next do event1).
- After event1 occurs, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Given these, the only possible run consistent with the description is: event2 (initial) → event1 → stop.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is satisfied because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the implication: (C1) ⇒ (event2 happens). Since C1 is true in the model, the implication reduces to checking that event2 happens; and event2 does happen (it happened initially).

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 is true in the given system.
- C2 is therefore true because its antecedent holds and its consequent also holds in the system. (More generally, an implication is true whenever the antecedent is false or the consequent is true; here antecedent true and consequent true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen.
Because both rules hold and event2 occurred initially, the system produces an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … (event1 does occur, and then event2 again, and so on).

Step 3 — meaning of the given conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly Rule B; given the rule, C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is a disjunction: (event2 happened) ∨ (C1 true).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- C1 is true, because Rule B says whenever event1 happens, event2 follows.
- C2 is true as well: event2 has already happened (initial condition), so the left disjunct is true, making the whole disjunction true. (In fact, here both disjuncts are true: event2 did happen and C1 holds.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There is some future time at which event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Expanded: if event2 occurs, then event1 eventually happens.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From Rule A, whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur later. That is exactly the content of C2 (event2 ⇒ event1 eventually).
- From the initial condition that event2 did happen, Rule A implies C1 (event1 will eventually happen in this run).
- Rule B (event1 is terminal) does not prevent C1; it only says nothing follows event1.

Conclusion about C2:
- C2 is True. The stated transition rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" makes the implication in C2 true.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 has occurred, event2 will occur at some later point).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬E2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" i.e. (¬E2) ∨ E2. (This is the disjunction of C1 and E2.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what follows?
- From the initial condition (event1 happened) and Rule A, event2 must happen. So E2 is true in this scenario.
- Therefore C1 (¬E2) is false.
- C2 is (¬E2) ∨ E2. In classical logic this is a tautology (law of excluded middle) and evaluates to true. Concretely here, since E2 is true, the disjunction is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event2 happened (so E2 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
(So both events, if they occur, stop further events; but we are told event2 did occur initially.)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is the statement ¬E2.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the implication (¬E2) → E2.

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition, E2 is true, so C1 (¬E2) is false.
- In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Because C1 is false, the implication (¬E2) → E2 is true in this context.
- (Note: hypothetically, if C1 were true, then C2 would require E2 to be true as well, which would be a contradiction; in that hypothetical C2 would be false. But that hypothetical cannot occur given the initial fact E2.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at the start/event time 0, event1 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal — once it has occurred, the trace has no further events.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then subsequently event1 occurs.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (read as: event2 occurs in the actual execution/trace — certainly it would have to occur at some point; equivalently, in every allowed run/event sequence event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event2 does not always happen / event2 does not occur in the actual run.)

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- Because initially event1 has happened and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no event (including event2) can occur after that initial moment.
- There is no possibility for event2 to have happened before the initial moment (the initial condition fixes the start).
- Therefore event2 does not occur in the run (so C1 is false).
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

(If you meant a different reading of “always happens,” say so and I can re-evaluate; under the natural readings above the conclusion is the same.)

True

Because event1 occurs initially and prevents any subsequent events, event2 cannot occur, so C1 is false and therefore C2 (that C1 does not hold) is true."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Two postconditions: ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen.""

2) Transition rules (what can happen after what)
- Because ""after event1 no other events can happen"" and event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur in this scenario.
- The rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never actually occurs given the initial condition.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; logically C1 ≡ (event2). (True exactly when event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Substituting C1 ≡ event2 gives C2 ≡ (event2 → event2).

4) How they relate and truth values
- C1 is false in the given scenario because event2 does not happen (event1 occurring first blocks any further events).
- C2 simplifies to event2 → event2, which is a logical tautology (an implication with the same antecedent and consequent). In classical logic that formula is always true, and in the particular timeline here it is also true (the antecedent is false, making the implication true vacuously).
- Therefore: C1 is false in this world; C2 is true.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., any continuation from the state where event1 has occurred includes event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the initial condition and the transition rule, this reads as: in the actual/allowed execution(s) starting from the given initial state, event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" This is a logical disjunction: C2 is true if either C1 is true, or event1 is true (or both).

4) How they relate / truth values
- From (1) and (2): event1 happened initially and the rule forces event2 after event1, so event2 does occur. Therefore C1 is true.
- Since event1 also happened initially, the right disjunct of C2 is true regardless. So C2 = (C1) OR (event1) = True OR True = True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at time 0).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime afterward).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, the system produces no further events).

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Interpreting this in the usual future-oriented sense (F event1 in temporal logic): from the current time there exists some future time (possibly now) at which event1 occurs.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreting this as G(C1) i.e., at every time point along the execution, C1 is true. Equivalently G F(event1): from every point in time there is some (possibly later) time when event1 will occur.

(You mentioned C3 but no definition was given; I ignore it.)

4) How these relate / evaluation
- At the initial time (time 0) event1 has occurred, so C1 is true at time 0 (event1 happens now).
- But by Rule B, after event1 occurs there are no further events, so at any strictly later time there will be no future occurrence of event1. Therefore at those later times C1 (F event1) is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold at every time point. Since C1 is false at the times after the initial event, C2 is false.

Note (semantic caveat): If you instead interpreted “C1” as “event1 has occurred at some time up to now” (a past modality), then once event1 occurs that past-property would remain true and C2 (always C1) would be true. But under the standard future/modal interpretation used above, C2 is false.

Summary answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. at the start of the scenario, event1 is true/has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 occurs, no further events can occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards; equivalently event2 ⇒ event1.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p ⇒ p). It is true in every situation where the phrase is interpreted in the usual logical sense.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 = (event1) ∧ (C1).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition, event1 has happened, so the left conjunct of C2 (event1) is true.
- C1 is a tautology, so C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 = true ∧ true = True.
- The transition rules do not contradict this: because event1 already happened, Rule A simply forbids any further events (so event2 cannot occur after event1); Rule B is either vacuously satisfied (if event2 never occurs) or consistent if event2 had occurred earlier and was followed by event1 — nothing here invalidates the fact that event1 did happen initially.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Justification: event1 is given as having happened, and C1 (""if event1 happens then event1 happens"") is a tautology, so both conjuncts of C2 hold. The transition rules do not contradict this."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition that event2 already happened, C1 is true (event2 has occurred).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Formally C2 = (C1 ∨ event1).

4) How the conditions relate
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction C1 ∨ event1 is true regardless of whether event1 ever occurs. Therefore C2 is true.
- (Side note: because event2 is terminal, event1 cannot occur after the initial event2, though it could have occurred before — but that detail does not affect the truth of C2 because C1 already holds.)

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the current/initial state is one in which event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event1 occurs (in some state), then event2 must occur in the next state. (event1 → next-state event2)
- Rule B: If event2 occurs (in some state), then no events can occur afterwards. In other words, event2 is terminal: after event2 there are no further events.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (i.e. immediately after the current/initial state)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (i.e. event1 does not happen in the next state)

4) How these relate / logical conclusion
- We start in a state where event2 has already happened (by the initial condition).
- By Rule B, once event2 has happened there can be no subsequent events. Therefore in the next state no events (including event1) can occur.
- Thus C1 (“event1 happens in the next state”) is false.
- Therefore C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is true.

(If you meant “next state” relative to a different reference point, or if “initially” has a different formal meaning, let me know and I can adapt the reasoning.)

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., it is not the case that both events happen.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no other event (including event2) can occur after that initial event1. Therefore event2 cannot happen.
- Since event2 cannot happen, the conjunction in C1 (event2 happens and event1 happens) is false.
- Hence C1 does not hold, so C2 is true.

(If one reads Rule B differently — for example, as “if event2 happens then event1 must have happened sometime” — the initial event1 still prevents any subsequent events, so event2 is still impossible and the conclusion is the same.)

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
- Together these force an alternating sequence: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → event1 → …

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. ¬E2)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" In logical form C2 = (¬E2) ∨ E2.

4) How the conditions relate and truth values
- C1 is false given the initial fact that event2 happened (and, by the transition rules, event2 will occur repeatedly).
- C2 = (¬E2) ∨ E2 is a logical tautology (the law of excluded middle): it is true regardless of whether event2 happens.
- Concretely here, since event2 does happen initially, C2 is true (and it would be true even if event2 didn’t happen, because then ¬E2 would hold).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (so the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 occurs, that execution is terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 occurs, that execution is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible execution/run, event1 occurs (i.e., event1 is guaranteed in all behaviors).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is, it claims C1 is false (there exists at least one execution where event1 does not happen).

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened initially and rule B says that after event2 no other events can happen, any execution that starts with the given initial condition is terminal and cannot include event1 later. Thus there is at least one execution (the actual initial one) where event1 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

(One caveat: if you intended “initially event2 happened” to allow event1 to have happened simultaneously at the initial moment as well, the answer could differ. Under the usual sequential/standard reading that event2 happened and no further events occur, C2 is True.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (so the actual run begins with event1).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context this reads as ""event1 happens in the (given) execution"" — and the context explicitly states that event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is a disjunction: C2 is true if either event2 occurs or C1 is true.

4) How they relate
- From the initial condition, event1 does happen, so C1 is true.
- Because event1 occurs at the start and is terminal, event2 cannot occur in that execution (so event2 is false here).
- But C2 is the disjunction (event2) OR C1. Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event2.

Therefore C2 is true (entailment from the given context). 

Note on ambiguity: If by ""always happens"" you meant some other stronger temporal notion, clarify and I can adjust the reasoning — but under the natural reading given the context, C1 holds and thus C2 holds.

Short answer: C2 is True (under the natural interpretation). Below are the step-by-step answers you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state 0), event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. if event1 happens in a state, then event2 happens in the next state).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. if event2 happens in a state, then event1 happens in the next state).

From these two rules the events alternate: starting from state0 where event2 occurred, the sequence is
state0: event2
state1: event1 (by Rule B)
state2: event2 (by Rule A)
state3: event1, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted relative to the current state, C1 asserts event1 occurs in the immediate successor state.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" This is the logical disjunction: (event1 happens in the next state) OR (event1 happens). (If you mean the second disjunct to be ""event1 happens in the current state"" that is a different, explicitly-time-qualified reading — see note below.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 True or False?
- Given the initial condition (state0: event2) and the transition rules, event1 does indeed happen in the next state (state1). So C1 is True.
- C2 is (C1) OR (event1 happens). Since C1 is True, the disjunction is True regardless of the second disjunct. Therefore C2 is True.

Note on possible ambiguity: if the second disjunct of C2 meant ""event1 happens in the current state,"" then initially that second disjunct is False (current state has event2), but C1 is still True, so C2 remains True. If the second disjunct meant ""event1 happens (in some other unspecified time),"" you should specify the time to be precise; under any reasonable interpretation that uses the given rules, C2 is True because C1 is True.

Reason: Initially event1 occurs, and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any future events (so event2 can never occur later).

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the start of every run).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: once it has happened, the run has no further events.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then a subsequent event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (read as: in every run there is an occurrence of event2.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (a conditional: if event2 always happens, then event1 happens.)

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the context, event1 already happens initially in every run. So the consequent of C2 (""event1 happens"") is already true in the context.
- C1 is actually incompatible with the context: because event1 happens initially and is terminal, no other events (including event2) can occur after it, so event2 cannot occur in any run — therefore C1 is false.
- Regardless, C2 (the implication ""if C1 then event1"") is true given the context, because event1 already happens. (Logically: the consequent is true, so the implication holds.)

So: C1 = False; C2 = True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” So once event1 has occurred the run is terminal (no further events).
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” So event2 would also be terminal if it ever occurs.

2) Transition rules / reachability
- From the initial situation (event1 already happened) there are no further events possible. Therefore event2 never actually occurs in any reachable continuation of the given initial state.
- In general the rules say both event1 and event2 are terminal events (no subsequent events after either occurs).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” Formally C1 is the implication event2 → event2. That is a logical tautology (p → p) — it is true whenever evaluated.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” That means C1 holds at every state/time (e.g., in temporal logic: G(event2 → event2)).

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Since C1 is a pure tautology, it is true in every state, whether or not event2 can actually occur. In particular it is true vacuously whenever event2 never occurs.
- Therefore C2 (that C1 always holds) is true.

So C2 = True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is the tautology (event2 → event2), which is true in every state; therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (it is true in the initial state).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 occurs, no other events can occur (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards.

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition that event2 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" This is the logical disjunction (C1) OR (event2 happens). Both disjuncts assert that event2 occurs (one as ""eventually"", the other directly).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final verdict
- Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true. Therefore C2 = (true) OR (something) is true.
- Even without appealing to C1, the second disjunct (""event2 happens"") is itself true because of the initial condition, so C2 is true in any case.

Answer: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 has already occurred, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true; therefore C2 = C1 OR (event2 happens) is true."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (and that is the starting fact).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 were to happen, it would be terminal as well).

Given the initial fact that event1 happened and it blocks any further events, in this scenario event2 does not actually occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is simply a redundant conjunction; logically C1 ≡ (event2). C1 is true exactly when event2 happens; in the given scenario it is false (because event2 does not happen).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Symbolically C2 is event2 → C1. Since C1 ≡ event2, C2 ≡ (event2 → event2).

4) How they relate and final answer
- event2 → event2 is a logical tautology (an implication with the same antecedent and consequent is always true). Equivalently, in classical logic any implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true; here antecedent and consequent coincide so the implication is always true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- Therefore C2 is True.

(If you use a non‑standard conditional with different semantics than material implication, the answer could differ, but under ordinary/material implication C2 is true.)

True

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Because event1 happened initially and is terminal, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" This is the conjunction (event1 ∧ event2).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the implication (C1 → event2).

(There is no C3 in the given text.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth-values
- Truth of C1: event1 is true, event2 is false (because event1 happened and prevents any later events). Thus C1 (event1 ∧ event2) is false.
- Truth of C2: as a logical implication, C1 → event2 is true. Two ways to see this:
  1. Material implication: an implication with a false antecedent is true (C1 is false, so C1 → event2 is true).
  2. Logical entailment: C1 explicitly includes event2 as a conjunct, so C1 logically entails event2; the implication is therefore tautologically true (if the conjunction held, the conjunct would hold).

Conclusion
- C1 is false.
- C2 is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (initially).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, the sequence stops).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunction; logically C1 ≡ (event2 happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — i.e. (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition, event2 has happened, so C1 is true.
- Therefore the disjunction C2 (C1 or event1) is true regardless of the status of event1.
- (Also, by the transition rule, event1 must happen after event2, so event1 will be true as well; either way C2 is true.)

So C2 is True. (If you meant ""happens now"" versus ""happened at some time,"" note that under the usual read of these statements as occurrences in the history, the conclusion still holds.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., in the initial state/event trace, event2 occurs).

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event1 occurs, then afterwards event2 must occur.
- If event2 occurs, then no other events can occur after it.

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: event1 does not happen (there is no occurrence of event1 in the trace).
- C2: if C1 holds (i.e., if event1 does not happen), then event2 happens.

Step 4 — how they relate and final verdict
- The context already states that event2 happened initially. That makes event2 true in the trace regardless of whether event1 happens or not.
- Also, because event2 happens at the start and after event2 no further events can occur, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2 (so in the given trace, C1 holds).
- Therefore the implication ""if event1 does not happen then event2 happens"" is true in this context: the antecedent C1 is true and the consequent (event2 happens) is also true.

Conclusion: C2 is True. (If you meant a different temporal reading—e.g., allowing traces where event2 might not occur initially—state that and I can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened. So in the initial state: event2 = true, event1 = false.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — once you are in a state where event2 has happened, there is no future state in which event1 or event2 occurs (i.e. no further occurrences of these events).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — if event1 occurs in some state, there must be a later state in which event2 occurs.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — this is a state formula that is true in a state exactly when event1 ∨ event2 holds in that state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this asserts that in the immediate successor state, event1 ∨ event2 is true.
(There is no C3 given.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- In the initial state C1 is true because event2 holds now.
- C2 asks about the next state. By the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the next state (if any) cannot have event1 or event2 true. Therefore C1 is false in the next state.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 did not occur.

Conclusion: C2 is False (C1 does not hold in the next state). 

Note on ambiguity: If one instead interpreted event2 as a proposition that remains true forever after it happens (i.e., it persists into all future states), then C2 would be True. Under the usual reading of ""after event2 no other events can happen"" (event2 marks a terminal occurrence and does not persist), C2 is False — which is the standard intended reading here.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (i.e., event1 → event2).
- If event2 happens, no further events can happen after it (event2 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — read as: from the initial state, event1 occurs in the next state.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — the disjunction: (event1 happens next) OR (event2 happens).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 already happened in the initial state and event2 is terminal, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- However, the disjunction C2 is true if either disjunct is true. The second disjunct (""event2 happens"") is true in the initial state (event2 happened initially). Therefore C2 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time/state s0, event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen: if a state has event1 then the immediately next state has event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen: if a state has event2 then the immediately next state has event1.
- So the state sequence is an alternating chain: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ….

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This is redundant but equivalent to simply “event2 holds in the current state.”
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Equivalently: next(event2) — “event2 holds in the immediately following state.”

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- Evaluate at the initial state s0 (where event1 holds). The next state s1 has event2, so C1 is true at s1. Therefore C2 is true at s0.
- Note: C2 is not true in every state. For example at s1 (event2), the next state s2 has event1, so C1 is false at s2 and thus C2 is false at s1. The truth of C2 alternates along with the events.

Answer to the question: C2 is True in the initial state (s0). It is not universally true in every state — it holds exactly in those states whose successor state has event2.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0), event2 happened (event2 is true in S0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen — i.e., if event1 is true in state t then event2 is true in state t+1.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen — i.e., if event2 is true in state t then event1 is true in state t+1.

(Assumption: “after” means in the immediately next state, and events are evaluated per state.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — in a given state, at least one of event1 or event2 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the state immediately following the current state, C1 is true (so the next state has event1 or event2).

4) How they relate / conclusion
- In S0: event2 is true.
- By Rule B, in S1 (the next state) event1 must be true.
- Therefore C1 (event1 or event2) is true in S1.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (so event1 → next event2).
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen (so event2 → next event1).
- Combined with the initial event2, this produces an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction of the same proposition; logically C1 is equivalent to the single proposition ""event2 happens"" (call it p).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Written in propositional form: C1 → p. Since C1 ≡ p, C2 is p → p.

(There was no C3 given in the statement.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true or false?
- In classical propositional logic p → p is always true (a tautology). So C2 is true.
- The temporal transition rules and the initial condition are consistent with C2 but not needed to determine its truth: C2 is true purely by the logical form.

Note: This conclusion assumes standard (material) implication and that the two occurrences of ""event2 happens"" denote the same atomic proposition. If you intended temporal distinctions (e.g., C1 says ""event2 happened sometime in the past"" and C2 asserts ""event2 will happen in the future"") then the interpretation changes and we would need to re-evaluate with a temporal logic reading.

True. C1 is just p (""event2 happens""), so C2 is p → p, which is a tautology (always true)."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 will occur.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal – once it occurs, the trace ends or no further events occur.)

Given the initial condition (event1 already happened) and Rule B, no other events occur in the actual trace (event2 never happens).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as a propositional implication A -> A (where A = “event1 happens”). That is a logical tautology: whenever A is true, A is true; if A is false the implication is also true. So C1 is true in every state/trace under the usual reading.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that the formula C1 is true in every state/trace (i.e., globally).

4) How they relate and final verdict
- Because C1 is a propositional tautology (A -> A), it holds in every possible state/trace regardless of the context, so C2 (“C1 always holds”) is true.
- Note/caveat: if one intended a nonstandard temporal reading where the consequent refers to a different time (e.g., “if event1 happens now then event1 will happen later”), then the statement is not the plain tautology and could fail in some models. But under the natural reading of C1 as the reflexive implication A -> A (or as “if event1 occurs then it occurs”), C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True (even though C1 is False).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, there are no further events.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur at a later time.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists a future time when event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — C2 is the disjunction [event2 eventually happens] OR [event1 happens (at some time)].

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 already happened initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no other events (including event2) can occur in the future. So C1 is false.
- However, event1 has already happened, so the second disjunct of C2 is true. Therefore the disjunction C2 is true (True ∨ False = True).

(If you read Rule B differently — e.g., as “if event2 happens then event1 must have happened before” — the same conclusion holds: event2 still cannot occur because event1’s occurrence forbids any further events, and C2 remains true because event1 has happened.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., event1 = true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. So if event1 occurs, event2 will occur (event2 = true).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. So event2 is terminal: nothing follows it.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is the statement/event1 = false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This means ¬C1, i.e., C1 is not true (equivalently, C1 is false).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Given the initial condition that event1 happened, C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2, which asserts that C1 does not hold, is true.
- (Separately, by the transition rules, because event1 happened, event2 must also happen; and thereafter no further events occur. Those facts don't change the truth-values of C1 and C2.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state (so at time 0, event1 is true).
- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" These mean that once event1 (or event2) has occurred at some time t, there are no event occurrences at any strictly later times.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs at time t then for every s > t no events occur (the system becomes quiescent forever after that point).
- Likewise, if event2 occurs at time t then for every s > t no events occur.
- Because event1 already occurred initially, the system is already in that quiescent regime for all future times.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at the initial state, this says event1 holds at time 1 (the state immediately after the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This says there exists some future time at which C1 is true (i.e., at some time k, event1 holds at the next state after k).

4) Relation and evaluation
- Since event1 already occurred initially and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" forbids any events at any later time, event1 cannot occur at any later state. Thus C1 is false at the initial state (event1 does not happen in the next state), and C1 will never become true at any future time.
- Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.

(If you meant a different temporal interpretation of ""after"" — e.g., only forbidding events in the immediate next step but allowing events later — state that and I can re-evaluate. Under the usual interpretation ""after"" = forever after, C2 is false.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreting this in the usual way: once event1 has happened at some state, there are no events in any subsequent state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Irrelevant here because event2 never happens in the given scenario.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" If we name the initial state s0, the ""next state"" is s1; C1 asserts event1 occurs at s1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" From the current (initial) perspective, C2 asserts that in s1 the condition C1 is true. But C1 itself says event1 happens in the next state relative to where C1 is evaluated. So evaluated at s0:
  - C2 says: in s1, event1 happens in s2 (i.e. it asserts event1 occurs two steps ahead). (An easier equivalent: C2 says ""in the state after the next state, event1 happens"".)

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Since event1 happened at s0 and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" forbids any events in s1 and beyond, event1 cannot happen in s1 (so C1 is false at s0).
- Consequently, C2 (which requires event1 to occur at s2) is also false.

Therefore C2 is False.

(If you intended a different reading of ""no other events"" — e.g. “no events except event1 are allowed after event1,” so event1 could repeat — state that and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 asserts that C1 (event1 occurs in the next state) holds in the next state, i.e. that event1 occurs two steps ahead. But event1 already occurred at s0 and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" prevents any events in s1 or later, so event1 cannot occur in s1 or s2. Hence C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens at some state, then event1 must happen after that (i.e., the state immediately following an event2 must have event1).
- Rule B: If event1 happens at some state, then no events can happen after that (i.e., there is no subsequent state that contains event1 or event2 — the run terminates or the following state has no events).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is a proposition about a given state: it is true in a state iff that state contains event1 or event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the immediate successor state (one step after the current state) either event1 or event2 occurs.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- At the initial state s0 we have event1, so C1 is true in s0.
- By Rule B, after a state where event1 happened there are no events in the next state. So the immediate successor state s1 contains neither event1 nor event2.
- Therefore C1 is false in s1.
- C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state (s1), but we just found C1 is false there.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: at the initial state s0 event1 holds, so by Rule B the next state s1 contains no events, hence C1 (event1 or event2) is false in s1, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
- Therefore you cannot have both events in a run; once either occurs, the system stops.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the initial state (event2 already happened) and that event2 is terminal, event1 cannot happen later → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" This is the disjunction (C1) OR (event2 happens).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 is false (event1 cannot occur).
- The second disjunct ""event2 happens"" is true because event2 happened initially.
- Therefore C2 = false OR true = true.

So C2 is True. (Note: this assumes ""event2 happens"" in C2 can be satisfied by the initial occurrence of event2; if you meant only future occurrences, the same conclusion holds because event2 already occurred and no future events can occur.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 has already occurred, so the disjunction ""C1 (event1 eventually happens) OR event2 happens"" is true (C1 is false but ""event2 happens"" is true due to the initial occurrence)."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at least once initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen (i.e. every occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (so occurrences alternate indefinitely once started).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreted as: there is no occurrence of event1.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → (not event1).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From Step 2 and the fact that event2 did happen initially, event1 must occur afterward. Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is the implication ""if event2 happens then event1 does not happen."" Here the antecedent (event2 happens) is true and the consequent (event1 does not happen) is false, so the implication is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 does happen initially, and the rules force event1 to occur afterward, so C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false. The implication ""if event2 then C1"" has a true antecedent and a false consequent, hence the implication is false."

Short answer: C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at time 0.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: Whenever event1 happens at time t, event2 must happen next (time t+1).
- Rule B: Whenever event2 happens at time t, event1 must happen next (time t+1).
Together these force alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (Interpretation used below: there is no occurrence of event2 at any time.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (There exists some time after which C1 is true — i.e., from some point on, event2 never happens.)

(If you instead meant C1 as ""event2 does not happen at a particular instant"", the same alternation argument shows that at the immediate next instant after the initial event1, event2 does happen, so C1 would be false there as well.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the rules and the initial event1 at time 0 we get by simple induction:
  - time 0: event1
  - time 1: event2 (by Rule A)
  - time 2: event1 (by Rule B)
  - time 3: event2, and so on.
- So event2 occurs at times 1, 3, 5, ... (infinitely often). Therefore the statement ""event2 never happens"" (C1) is false, and there is no future time after which event2 stops happening. Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.

Therefore C2 is False.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., event1 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (¬event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., C1 is false. Equivalently, C2 asserts event1 does happen.

4) How they relate
- Since the context states event1 did happen, C1 (¬event1) is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

So C2 is True. (As a corollary, because event1 happened and is terminal, no other events — including event2 after event1 — can occur.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs the system has no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows).

A possible trace consistent with these rules: initially event2, then event1, then nothing else.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is event2 → event2. This is a propositional tautology: for any truth value of event2, the implication P → P is true. So C1 holds in every state (it is always true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted temporally, this says there exists some point in the (future) execution where C1 is true. Since C1 is true in every state, it certainly holds at some (indeed every) point, so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied.

4) How the conditions relate
- Because C1 is a tautology (always true), C2 (""eventually C1"") is automatically true regardless of the initial condition or transition rules. The given initial event and the transition rules are irrelevant to the truth of C2 in this formulation.

Therefore C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True (under the normal forward-in-time reading). Explanation below, step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1 is terminal: once it has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards.)

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (No occurrence of event2 in the considered execution/future.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true at all times / in all reachable states; equivalently, event2 never happens in any reachable future.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event1 has already happened initially and Rule B says no events may occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. So in every reachable future from the given initial state, event2 does not happen. Therefore C1 is true in all reachable states, and C2 (that C1 always holds) is true.

A brief formal-ish justification: assume for contradiction that event2 occurs at some time t ≥ initial. But event1 already occurred at the initial time and Rule B forbids any events after event1, so event2 cannot occur later — contradiction. Hence event2 never occurs.

Note on assumptions: this conclusion assumes we interpret the scenario as describing forward time from the given initial state (i.e., we care about events after the initial moment). If one instead allows arbitrary history before the initial moment and asks whether event2 ever happened in the past, that is unrelated to the given rules and could be different; under the usual reading, C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 occurs, event1 will occur sometime afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the timeline under these rules: event2 happens initially → then event1 must happen → then nothing else.

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is the same disjunct repeated, so C1 ≡ (event2).  
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Substituting C1 ≡ event2 gives C2 ≡ (event2 or event2) ≡ event2.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value
- Both C1 and C2 are logically equivalent to the single proposition ""event2 happens.""
- Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true and therefore C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state). Nothing in the context says event1 is true initially.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has happened, there is no later state in which any event occurs.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Interpreted as the conjunction event2 ∧ event1 holding in a state (both true in that state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, in the immediate successor state of the initial state, both event2 and event1 are true.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- The initial state has event2 true (and event1 is not given as true).
- By Rule B, after event2 no other events can happen, so the successor state cannot have event1 true (and typically cannot have any event true).
- Therefore the successor state cannot satisfy event2 ∧ event1, so C1 is not true in the next state.
- Hence C2 is False.

(Edge notes: If you adopt a different semantics — e.g. events persist forever, or ""after"" is interpreted differently — you should state that explicitly. Under the natural reading above (events are true only when they occur and Rule B blocks any later events), C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the next state cannot have event1 (Rule B: after event2 no other events can happen), so it cannot satisfy event2 ∧ event1. If you used a different semantics where events persist, you should state that explicitly — under the natural reading above, C2 is False."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (So any valid future after a state where event1 has occurred contains event2 at some subsequent point — in particular, since event1 already happened initially, event2 must occur later.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (A claim that event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (In the next state, the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" is true.)

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because the initial state already has event1 and Rule A requires event2 to occur after event1, event2 must occur in any valid evolution. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false in every valid run.
- If event2 must occur, then in the next state (or at the required future point) event2 will occur, so C1 is not true in that next state either. Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

(If you meant a different formal reading of ""after"" — e.g. immediate next-state versus eventually — the conclusion is the same: the rules force event2 to occur, so C1 is impossible and C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event1 has already occurred and the rules require event2 to occur afterward, ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) cannot be true in any future state; therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False. (Also C1 is False.)

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e. event1 → event2 next).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. event2 → event1 next).
These rules force alternation: once event2 happens, event1 must follow, then event2 must follow, etc.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (read naturally as “event2 never happens” / the statement that no occurrence of event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" i.e. for all times, C1 is true (equivalently: event2 never happens at any time).

4) How they relate
- The initial condition already gives an occurrence of event2, so C1 (that event2 does not happen) is false.
- Since C1 is false already at the initial moment, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Therefore C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur sometime after (event1 → eventually event2).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime after (event2 → eventually event1).
(These rules force the two events to alternate in the future, but that detail is not needed to answer C2.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Interpreting this as the plain propositional statement P := (event2 happened) OR (event1 happened). At the initial moment event2 has happened, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = NOT C1 = NOT (event2 or event1) = (not event2) AND (not event1).

4) How they relate / conclusion
- Since event2 already happened, C1 is true. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is false.
- The transition rules only reinforce that at least one of the events happens (indeed both will continue to occur), so there is no way for C2 to become true under the given facts.

Short answer: C2 is False (given the natural temporal reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (initially) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. eventually following any event2 there will be an event1).
- After event1 occurs, no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean (natural temporal reading)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as a temporal/global property G(event2): at every future point event2 holds (i.e. from now on, at every step/event occurrence event2 happens).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — interpreted as F G(event2): there is some future point from which, forever after, event2 always holds.

(If instead C1 were intended to mean ""in every run/event sequence event2 occurs at least once"", the answer would differ; see note at the end.)

4) How the rules and conditions relate (truth-value reasoning)
- Timeline forced by the rules: initially event2 occurs. Then because ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will occur next. After that event1 occurs, ""no other events can happen"", so the run terminates (no further event2).
- Therefore there cannot be a suffix of the execution where event2 holds at every step forever. So G(event2) is false now, and there is no future point from which G(event2) becomes true.
- Hence C1 (G(event2)) is false, and C2 (F G(event2)) is also false.

Conclusion: Under the standard temporal interpretation (C1 = always/eventually always), C2 is False.

Note on ambiguity: If C1 was intended merely as ""event2 occurs in every complete execution at least once"" then C1 is true here (because it happens initially) and C2 is trivially true. The natural nested temporal reading F G(event2) is the one that makes the question interesting, and under that reading C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: starting from the initial event2, event1 must occur next and is terminal, so there is no future suffix from which event2 holds forever; hence F G(event2) is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial state: event1 has already happened (holds at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward (event2 ⇒ sometime later event1).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there is some future time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — both that event2 eventually happens and that event1 happens (event1 already does hold initially).

4) How the conditions relate and final reasoning
- Because event1 has already happened initially and rule B forbids any events after event1, no other events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false.
- C2 requires C1 to be true (and event1 to hold). Although event1 does hold, C1 is false, so C2 is false.

So C2 is False. (Only if you allow event2 to have occurred before the ""initial"" point could C1 be true; under the usual reading that ""initially event1 happened"" fixes the start state, C1 and thus C2 are false.)

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start of the run).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., once event2 has occurred, event1 will occur afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (This is ambiguous: it could mean (a) event2 occurs at every time point, or (b) in every possible run/event sequence event2 occurs at least once. Neither interpretation is needed for the final result, but under the usual reading of ""always"" as a global/for-all-times claim, C1 is false in general from the given info — we only know event2 happened initially in this run.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Logical disjunction: C2 is true if at least one of (event1 happens) or (C1) is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition and the transition rule, since event2 happened, event1 must happen afterward. Therefore (in this run) event1 does happen.
- Given that ""event1 happens"" is true, the disjunction ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" is true regardless of whether C1 is true or false.
- Therefore C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Since event2 occurred and that obligates event1 to occur afterward, event1 happens in the run; hence ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" is true. Final answer: True."

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially. That means in the actual timeline being described, event2 has occurred and is the current/initial fact.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1 is written as ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" That is simply a redundant disjunction and is logically equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Given C1 ≡ ""event1 happens"", C2 ≡ ""event1 happens AND event1 happens"", i.e. just ""event1 happens.""

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 forbids any further events, event1 does not (and cannot) happen in this scenario.
- Therefore ""event1 happens"" is false, so C1 is false, and C2 (which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"") is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e. at the start of the timeline event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (true iff there is no occurrence of event1 at any time).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (a conjunction: event1 happens AND event1 does not happen).

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, no other events can occur after that point. Thus event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- Could event1 have happened before the initial event2? No: if event1 had happened before, then by the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" event2 could not then have occurred as the initial event. That would contradict the given initial condition. So event1 could not have occurred at any time.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 requires both ""event1 happens"" and ""event1 does not happen"" simultaneously, which is impossible. Hence C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the initial moment/event, event2 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then a subsequent event2 must occur).

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (a claim that event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That is, globally/at all times C1 is true — equivalently, event2 never happens at any time.

4) How do these relate and what follows?
- The context explicitly states event2 happened initially, so C1 is false (it asserts event2 does not happen, but event2 does).
- Since C1 is false at the initial moment, the claim that C1 always holds (C2) is false as well.
- Therefore C2 is false (and the context entails ¬C1 and ¬C2).

(Other rules—e.g., ""after event1 then event2""—are irrelevant to making C2 true, because the initial occurrence of event2 already falsifies C1/C2.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
So whichever of those events occurs, it is terminal: no further events can occur after it.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — there exists a (future) time from the initial state when event1 occurs.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — the implication: whenever event2 happens, event1 will (eventually) happen.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition, event2 has happened already, so the antecedent of C2 is true.
- Because ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" once event2 has happened there is no possibility for event1 to happen in the future. Thus C1 is false (event1 does not eventually happen from the initial state).
- A true antecedent and a false consequent make the implication false. Therefore C2 is false.

(If one tried a different reading where ""if event2 happens"" is taken hypothetically for other possible runs where event2 occurs later, the same conclusion holds here because the given initial run already has event2 occurring and prevents event1. Under standard temporal/implication semantics, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 has already occurred and is terminal, so event1 cannot eventually occur (C1 is false). With a true antecedent and false consequent, the implication C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards (event2 ⇒ later event1).
- Rule B: If event1 happens, no other events can happen afterward (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (i.e., there is no occurrence of event2 at any time.)
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” In plain terms, C2 asserts both that event2 does not happen and that event2 does happen — a direct contradiction.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition and Rule B: since event1 has happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is therefore no possible occurrence of event2. So C1 is true.
- C2 requires event2 both not to happen (C1) and to happen at the same time. That is impossible. C2 is inconsistent/unsatisfiable and therefore false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

False

C2 asserts both ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens,"" which is contradictory. Given event1 already happened and no events can occur afterward, event2 cannot occur, so C1 is true and C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.
- Terminal conditions: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen.

2) Transition rules / possible histories
- Because event1 has already happened and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", no further events (in particular event2) can occur after the initial moment. So in every allowed history here, event2 does not occur.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Logically: event2 → event1.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Logically: (C1) → event2.
(There is no C3 given.)

4) How they relate and truth values
- event2 is false (it never happens).
- C1 = (event2 → event1) is true: an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth).
- C2 = (C1 → event2) has a true antecedent (C1 is true) and a false consequent (event2 is false), so C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False. (If you interpret ""if ... then ..."" differently than material implication, mention that and we can revisit.)

2) Transition rules

So the system forces an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the implication C1 ⇒ (event1 happens).

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- Because event2 occurs (C1 true), the transition rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 will occur. Hence the implication in C2 is true.
- (Note: even if C1 were false, the implication C1 ⇒ event1 would be vacuously true; but in our system C1 is true and the transition rule makes the consequent true as well.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at time 0 event2 is true).

2) Transition rules / dynamics:
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred the system is stuck — no further events occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal if it ever occurs).

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (Common readings: either (a) event1 holds at every state (G event1), or (b) event1 occurs at some time in every run / eventually (F event1). Either way it asserts that event1 occurs in the execution(s).)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the temporal-next of C1 (X C1): in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation:
- Because event2 happened initially and the rule “after event2 no other events can happen” locks the system, event1 cannot occur at any time in this execution. Thus C1 is false under any reasonable reading (event1 does not hold now nor ever).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. event2 is required/inevitable following event1).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (the process stops after event2).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalently, ""Event2 does not eventually happen.""

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Since event1 has happened and the rule says that after event1 event2 must happen, event2 will (inevitably) occur. That makes C1 true.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

(If ""must"" were intended in some non‑logical sense, the conclusion could differ, but under the standard logical reading above, C2 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has happened and rule A requires event2 to follow, so C1 is true and its negation C2 is false."

Short answers first: C2 is False.

Now, briefly and directly addressing the four parts.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the system admits no further events).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, it is followed by event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — i.e., at some (future) time event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — a disjunction: either event2 eventually happens, or event2 happens (both disjuncts assert occurrence of event2 in effect).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final evaluation)?
- Because the initial state already has event1 and Rule A forbids any further events after event1, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore event2 never happens, so C1 is false.
- Both disjuncts in C2 assert that event2 happens; since event2 does not happen, C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must happen next.
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must happen next.
So the system forces an alternation: starting from event2, the sequence is event2, event1, event2, event1, … forever.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Interpreting this in the usual temporal/logical sense, C1 means at every time point from the start onward event1 holds (formally: G event1).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” This means there is some time after which C1 is true forever (formally: F G event1) — i.e., eventually the system stabilizes so that from some point on only event1 occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth values
- C1 is false: because event2 occurs (initially and repeatedly), event1 is not true at every time point.
- C2 is false: there is no time after which only event1 occurs. After any event1 the rules require event2 next, so you cannot reach a suffix of the execution with only event1. Thus F G event1 fails.

Additional note (useful contrast)
- Although C1 and C2 are false, event1 does occur infinitely often (the sequence alternates), so the property “event1 occurs infinitely often” (GF event1) is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The system alternates forever (event2, event1, event2, ...), so there is no time after which only event1 occurs; F G event1 is false."

Short answer: C2 is True — C1 does not hold (is not supported) by the context.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (initially event2 happened).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This asserts that whenever event1 occurs, event2 also occurs (i.e., event2 happens in any situation where event1 happens).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This claims that the implication in C1 is not true / not supported by the context.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- From the context, event2 already happened initially and is terminal, so no further events (including event1) can occur after that. Thus in every allowed timeline given the context, event1 never actually happens.
- Because event1 cannot occur in the given scenario, there is no evidence or allowed sequence showing that event1 leads to event2. Interpreting the claim C1 as a substantive rule about what happens when event1 occurs, the context does not support C1.
- (Note: under pure material-implication logic the conditional ""if event1 then event2"" would be vacuously true when event1 never occurs. But in ordinary event/causal reasoning we treat such an implication as unsupported unless the context establishes a link or a possible occurrence of event1 that leads to event2.)

Therefore: C1 does not hold in the intended event/causal reading, so C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 happens initially and is terminal, so event1 never occurs in any allowed timeline; therefore there is no supported causal/behavioral link ""if event1 then event2."" (Note: under pure material implication C1 would be vacuously true, but under the intended event/causal reading C1 is not supported, so C2 is True.)"

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual interpretation below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0) event1 happened.

(Implicit assumption: time is discrete, states are ordered 0,1,2,..., and in each state one of these events is the one that happened. If you allow both to occur simultaneously or allow non‑immediate “after” semantics, the conclusion can change; I use the common interpretation below.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen — i.e. if event1 holds at state n then event2 holds at state n+1.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen — i.e. if event2 holds at state n then event1 holds at state n+1.

These two rules force an alternation of events from state to state.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Formally: X(event2) — the immediate next-state property.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Formally: G(C1) or G(X(event2)) — C1 is true at every state (globally).
(There is no C3 given in the problem.)

4) How the conditions relate
- From the initial condition (state0 = event1) and Rule A, C1 is true at state0: the next state (state1) must have event2.
- But examine state1: state1 = event2 (by alternation). By Rule B, the next state (state2) must be event1. Therefore C1 (which asserts “next state has event2”) is false when evaluated at state1.
- Hence C1 is not true at every state — it holds at states where the current event is event1, but fails at states where the current event is event2. So C2 = “C1 always holds” is false.

Concrete trace: state0: event1 (C1 true), state1: event2 (C1 false), state2: event1 (C1 true), state3: event2 (C1 false), … So C1 alternates true/false; it is not globally true.

If you intended a different meaning of “after” (e.g., “eventually after” rather than “in the immediate next state”), or if events can co‑occur, tell me and I’ll re-evaluate.

Summary answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (time 0) event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur (i.e., the next obligation is event1).
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur.

So the system forces an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Commonly this means event2 occurs at some time (now or later).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is true iff (a) event2 occurs at some time, and (b) event1 occurs at some time.

4) How they relate / reasoning
- The initial condition already gives event2 at time 0, so C1 is satisfied.
- Given the transition rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" the initial event2 forces that event1 will occur next. Thus event1 does happen.
- Therefore both parts of C2 hold (C1 true and event1 happens), so C2 is true.

(If you interpret ""eventually"" to mean strictly in the future, the conclusion is still the same: the initial event2 forces a future event1 and then a future event2, so event2 does occur in the future as well — C1 and C2 remain true.)

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state with event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (a state with event1 is also terminal).
- Thus from the initial state (which has event2) there are no outgoing transitions to any state where event1 could occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — there exists some current or future state in which event1 holds. (Even if ""eventually"" is taken to include the current state, the initial state has event2, not event1.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state of the current state, C1 is true (i.e., from the next state there is some future state where event1 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate and why is C2 False?
- From the initial state no further events can happen (because event2 made the state terminal), so there is no state in which event1 ever happens. Hence C1 is false.
- There is also no next state (or if you prefer, the next state exists but it cannot satisfy C1), so ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false.
- Therefore C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Initial state already has event2 and is terminal (no transitions). So event1 never occurs (C1 is false), and there is no next state in which C1 could hold — hence C2 is false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0), event1 has occurred.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur in some later state (so there is a successor state where event2 holds).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (the run ends or no further events are true).

A concrete minimal run consistent with these rules:  
state0: event1 holds.  
state1: event2 holds.  
no further states with events after state1.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreting this as the usual temporal ""eventually"" (F event1): at the current state, there exists some k ≥ 0 such that event1 holds at the state after k steps. (k = 0 allows it to be true immediately at the current state.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is X C1 (the next operator): at the immediate successor state, C1 must be true — i.e., from that successor state, event1 must eventually happen at some future (including possibly that successor) state.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- At the initial state (state0), C1 is true because event1 already holds there (k = 0).
- C2 asks whether C1 is true at state1 (the next state). From state1 the only future events are event2 and then nothing; event1 does not occur again. Thus from state1 there is no future state where event1 holds, so ""eventually event1"" (C1) is false at state1.
- Therefore C2 (X C1) is false in this model.

Note: If events could repeat or event1 could occur again after state1, C2 might be true; but under the given rules (event1 initially, then event2, then no more events), C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (F event1) is true at the initial state because event1 holds there, but at the next state event1 never again holds, so C1 is false at the next state — hence X C1 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start). There is no information that event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs then event2 occurs afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal — nothing can occur after it.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Concretely, C1 ≡ (event1 ∧ event2).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Concretely, C2 ≡ (event2 → C1) ≡ (event2 → (event1 ∧ event2)). This is equivalent to requiring that whenever event2 occurs, event1 must also occur.

Step 4 — how they relate; truth values
- From the initial condition we have event2 = true. From rule B (after event2 nothing can happen) and the fact event2 is initial, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur after event2; and nothing in the rules forces event1 to have happened before that initial event2. So event1 is not entailed and in the intended scenario event1 is false.
- Therefore C1 (event1 ∧ event2) is false (because event2 is true but event1 is false).
- Since event2 is true but C1 is false, C2 (event2 → C1) is false (a conditional with true antecedent and false consequent is false).

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (it happened initially).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, no further events may occur afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Symmetrically, if event2 occurs, nothing can follow it.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (A general implication: event1 → event2.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" So C2 is the conjunction (C1 is true) ∧ (event2 actually happens).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule says no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur after that initial event1. There is no earlier time for event2 to have happened (event1 is initial), so event2 does not occur.
- Therefore the antecedent of C1 (event1 happens) is true but the consequent (event2 happens) is false — so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to be true and event2 to occur. Both fail (C1 is false; event2 does not occur), so C2 is false.

(If you intended a different timing interpretation, e.g., allowing simultaneous occurrence of events, say so and I can re-evaluate under that assumption.)

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state (so the immediate successor state contains event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; all subsequent states have no events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., X event1 — one step from now).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the next state it is true that event1 happens in that state's next state. Equivalently C2 asserts event1 happens two steps from now (X X event1).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Timeline from the initial state:
  - state0 (initial): event1
  - state1 (next): event2  (by rule after event1)
  - state2 (two steps): no events  (after event2 nothing happens)
- Evaluate C1 at state0: C1 asks whether event1 happens in state1. State1 has event2, not event1 → C1 is false.
- Evaluate C2 at state0: C2 asks whether in state1 C1 holds, i.e. whether event1 happens in state2. State2 has no events → event1 does not happen two steps out → C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False. (Also C1 is False.)

False

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: initially E2 happened (E2 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules / constraints:
- After E1, no other events can happen (if E1 occurs at some time, there are no later events).
- After E2, no other events can happen (if E2 occurs at some time, there are no later events).

3) What the conditions mean:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" ≡ ¬E1.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ ¬(¬E1) ≡ E1 (so C2 asserts that event1 does happen).

4) How they relate and final evaluation:
- Since E2 already happened initially and the rule ""after E2 no other events can happen"" forbids any subsequent event, E1 cannot occur after that point.
- Under the usual reading that ""initially E2 happened"" is the actual starting fact (i.e., E1 did not also occur earlier or simultaneously), we conclude ¬E1 is true (C1 holds).
- Therefore C2 (which asserts E1) is false.

Note on edge cases: If one allowed E1 to have occurred before or simultaneously with the initial E2, the statements as given would be ambiguous and you couldn't conclude. Under the normal interpretation that only E2 is the initial event, C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterward (event1 implies a later event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This means that at some point in the timeline (now or later) event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C1: ¬C1 (i.e., event2 does not eventually happen).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what follows?
- Because event2 already happened initially, the statement ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true (the occurrence at the initial time satisfies ""eventually"").
- Therefore C1 is true, and C2 = ¬C1 is false.

Note: If you adopt a nonstandard reading of ""eventually"" that excludes the current instant and requires a strictly later occurrence, then C1 would be false (since no events can occur after the initial event2). Under the standard interpretation that ""eventually"" includes the present or some time ≥ now, C1 is true and thus C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False (under the usual interpretation of ""eventually"").

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

(Assumption: “initially” means event1 occurs at the earliest time; we take events to be ordered in time and not simultaneously unless stated.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” ⇒ If event2 occurs at some time t, there are no events at times > t.
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” ⇒ If event1 occurs at some time t, there are no events at times > t.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” A simple disjunction; C1 is true if at least one of event1 or event2 occurs.
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds.” This requires event2 to occur, and (since C1 is event1 or event2) at least one of event1/event2 to occur. So C2 is equivalent to “event2 happens” (because if event2 happens then C1 automatically holds).

4) How do these conditions relate and final evaluation?
- From the initial condition, event1 happens. Because “after event1, no other events can happen,” nothing can occur after that — in particular, event2 cannot occur after event1.
- There is no given information that event2 happened before event1 (and “initially event1 happened” implies event1 is the starting event), so the only consistent reading is that event2 does not occur at any time.
- Therefore C1 is true (because event1 happens). C2 requires event2 to happen; since event2 does not happen, C2 is false.

Note on alternatives: The only way C2 could be true is if event2 does happen (for example if the phrasing allowed both to happen simultaneously or event2 happened before event1). Under the natural reading given, C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: event1 happened (initially).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 occurs, event2 cannot occur afterwards.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Symmetrically, event2 would also be terminal.)

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Symbolically: event1 → event2.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Symbolically: event1 → (event1 → event2).

4) How do these relate and what are their truth values here?
- Evaluate C1 in the given context: event1 did happen, and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" prevents event2 from happening after event1. Therefore the consequent (event2 happens) is false in this actual situation, so C1 is false.
- Logical note: C2 (event1 → (event1 → event2)) is logically equivalent to C1 (event1 → event2). So whatever truth value C1 has, C2 has the same one. Therefore C2 is also false.

Remark: The only way C1/C2 could be true here is if event2 had already occurred prior to event1 (or if you interpret the statements differently). Under the given interpretation (event1 happened initially and no other events can follow it), C1 and hence C2 are false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (the system starts in a state where event1 occurred).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal: once event2 occurs, no further events can occur.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, no further events can occur.

(Implicit standard assumption used below: events occur sequentially in time and not concurrently.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — the conjunction that both events occur (at some points in the execution).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 is true in all executions (or at all times, equivalently here: in every possible run both events occur).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- The initial state already has event1. Since event1 is terminal, no further events can occur after that initial occurrence. Therefore event2 cannot occur in that execution.
- Thus C1 (both events happen) is false in the actual run; consequently C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Note on alternative semantics: if you allowed simultaneous occurrence of events and interpreted the ""after"" statements as only forbidding strictly later events, there could be an ambiguity. Under the usual sequential interpretation used above, C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (the system starts in a state where event1 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur after it.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (read as: in the system/execution, event2 occurs — e.g. in every run or at least at some point in the run; either reading still requires that event2 can occur.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. it is always true that C1 holds; in other words, C1 is true in the system.)

4) How they relate (reasoning to the conclusion)
- Because the initial state already has event1 and rule A forbids any events after event1, no further events can occur in any execution. In particular, event2 cannot occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false.

(As a side note: rule B is vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs, but that does not rescue C1.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (given): initially event2 happened. (I assume the initial state does not also include event1; if it did, state that explicitly.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Thus once either event occurs, the run stops and no further events can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some point in the future of the run, event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is effectively the same as C1 (it asserts event1 occurs and that the claim that it eventually happens is true).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what follows?
- Because event2 has already happened in the initial state and is terminal, no further events can occur after that point. Therefore event1 cannot occur in the run.
- Hence C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false, and so C2 (which requires C1 and event1) is also false.

Note on alternatives: if you intended the initial state to include event1 as well (i.e., both already happened), then C1 (and C2) would be true. But under the usual reading of your statement (""Initially, event2 happened"" and nothing said about event1 initially), C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: initially (at the start point) event2 happened. I.e., the current/initial state has event2 already occurred.

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: If event1 occurs, then afterwards event2 must occur (event1 → subsequently event2).
- Rule B: If event2 occurs, then no other events can happen afterwards (event2 is terminal).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — read as: from the initial point forward, at some time (now or in the future) event1 will occur.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — both that event1 happens (at some time) and that C1 is true. So C2 is true iff event1 occurs and event1 also occurs in the future (i.e., C1 true).

4) How do these relate and conclusion?
- Because the initial state already has event2 and rule B says no events can occur after event2, there is no possibility for event1 to occur now or later from the initial point. Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (""event1 happens and C1 holds"") is also false.

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
So starting from t0 with event2, the sequence is forced to alternate: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … (ad infinitum).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This phrase is ambiguous; two natural readings:
  a) Strong (pointwise) reading: event1 holds at every time point (i.e., at t0, t1, t2, …). In temporal-logic terms: G(event1) — globally event1.
  b) Weak (recurrence) reading: event1 happens repeatedly / infinitely often (or: whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows). In temporal-logic terms: GF(event1) or ""after event2, event1 will occur"".
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is the conjunction of C1 with the statement ""event1 happens"" (which itself is ambiguous but typically means ""event1 occurs at least once"" or simply ""is true at the current/next moment"").

4) How do these conditions relate and which are true?
Evaluate under the two readings of C1:

- Under the strong reading (C1 = event1 at every time):
  - The sequence shows at t0 event2 occurs, so event1 is false at t0. Hence C1 is false.
  - C2 is (C1 and event1). Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false regardless of whether ""event1 happens"" sometime. So C2 is false.

- Under the weak/recurrence reading (C1 = event1 occurs repeatedly / after event2):
  - From the alternating rule, event1 does occur at t1, t3, t5, … so event1 occurs infinitely often / always follows event2. Hence C1 (in this weak sense) is true.
  - ""event1 happens"" (interpreted as “event1 does occur at some times” or “occurs next at t1”) is also true.
  - Therefore C2 (C1 and event1) is true under this reading.

Summary answer to your specific question (""C2 is True or False?""):
- If ""always happens"" (C1) means ""holds at every time point"", then C1 is false and thus C2 is false.
- If ""always happens"" means ""occurs repeatedly / always follows event2"" (i.e., infinitely often), then C1 is true and C2 is true.

If you intended a specific precise meaning for ""always"" or for ""event1 happens"" (current time vs. at least once vs. infinitely often), tell me which and I will give the single definitive truth value.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Interpreting ""always happens"" as ""holds at every time"", event1 is false at the initial time (event2 happened at t0), so C1 is false and therefore C2 (C1 and event1) is false. If you meant the weaker ""happens infinitely often"", the answer would be True — tell me which interpretation you want."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., the next state after a state with event2 has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., the state following a state with event1 has no events).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (relative to the initial state, C1 asserts event2 occurs one step ahead).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state it is true that event2 happens in that state's next state. Equivalently C2 asserts that event2 happens two steps from the initial state.

4) How they relate / truth values
- Timeline given the rules:
  - State0 (initial): event2 happened.
  - State1 (next): must have event1 (by ""after event2, event1 must happen"").
  - State2 (after that): must have no events (because after event1 no other events can happen).
- C1 (event2 in State1) is false because State1 contains event1, not event2.
- C2 (event2 in State2) is false because State2 has no events.

Therefore C2 is False.

(If ""must happen"" were intended as ""event1 must occur eventually but not necessarily immediately,"" the answer could differ; the above uses the usual immediate-next interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial state event2, the next state must have event1 (and after that no events). So event2 does not occur in the next state (C1 false), nor two steps ahead (C2 false)."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at time t0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur at some later time.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur at some later time.
(So each occurrence of one forces a later occurrence of the other.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is true if event2 occurs at some time (including the initial time) or at some later time, depending on your reading of ""eventually.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires event1 to occur at some time, and that event2 occurs at some time.

4) How they relate / logical evaluation
- Since event2 happened initially (t0), C1 is already satisfied if ""eventually"" can include that occurrence. Even if ""eventually"" requires a future occurrence, the rules guarantee another event2 later because:
  - From the initial event2 (t0), the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 at some t1>t0.
  - Then ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces another event2 at some t2>t1.
  - This alternation continues indefinitely, so event1 does occur and event2 will occur again.
- Therefore both parts of C2 are satisfied: event1 happens, and event2 happens (hence C1 holds).

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurs at t0, so ""after event2"" forces an event1 at some t1>t0; then ""after event1"" forces an event2 at some t2>t1. Thus event1 occurs and event2 occurs, so C2 holds."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event1 happened (event1 is true at s0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen: so if event1 holds at some state, then in the next state event2 holds.
- After event2, event1 must happen: so if event2 holds at some state, then in the next state event1 holds.

Taken together (and reading “after” as “in the next state”), the states alternate:
s0: event1
s1: event2
s2: event1
s3: event2
… and so on.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 always happens” — i.e. event1 is true in every state (globally).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e. in the state s1 (the next state) it is true that event1 holds in every state from s1 onward.

(There is no C3 given.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- C1 would require event1 to be true at s1, but by the transition rules s1 has event2, not event1. Thus C1 is false at s0.
- C2 asserts that C1 is true at s1. But at s1 event1 is false (s1 has event2), so C1 is false at s1 as well. Therefore C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the current (initial) state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: after event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, there are no further event occurrences).
- Rule B: after event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, the next event must be event1).

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same as ""event2 happens"" (a redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the immediate successor state, event2 happens.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- We start in a state where event1 has happened. By Rule A, no other events can happen after this state, so there is no successor state in which event2 can occur (or, if you view a successor state as existing, it cannot contain event2).
- Therefore C1 (event2 happens) is false in the next state, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Note on edge semantics: if your formalism treats ""next"" as vacuously true when no next state exists, you should check that convention — in most standard interpretations Xφ (""next φ"") is false at a terminal state. Under that usual convention, C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: we start in a state where event1 has happened and Rule A forbids any further events, so there is no next state in which event2 can occur; therefore ""event2 holds in the next state"" (C2) is false under the usual next-state semantics."

Answer up front: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at least once).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next (or eventually).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next (or eventually).
So the rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""  
  This can be read two natural ways:
  a) As a propositional/material implication P -> P (where P = “event2 happens”): that is a tautology and is always true.
  b) As a temporal claim “If event2 happens now, then event2 will happen (again) later”: given the transition rules and the initial event2, event2 does indeed recur (event2 → event1 → event2), so this temporal reading is also satisfied.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C1.

4) How they relate
- Since C1 is true (under either the standard logical reading or the temporal reading supported by the given rules), its negation C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False. (Only caveat: if you adopt a nonstandard interpretation where implications or “must happen” are meant differently, conclusions could change — but under normal logical/temporal readings above, C1 holds and C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Explanation: C1 (""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"") is true (it is a tautological P → P, and under the given transitions event2 does recur), so its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially (in the initial state) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, no further events occur afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — event2 is also terminal: once event2 occurs, no further events occur afterward.

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This asserts that both events occur (in whatever state is being evaluated).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, in the state immediately following the current one, both event2 and event1 occur.

4) How do these relate and what follows?
- The initial state already has event2, and event2 is terminal, so after that (in the next state) no events can occur. Therefore in the next state neither event1 nor event2 can happen, so C1 does not hold in the next state.
- Even if one allowed simultaneous occurrences in the initial state (both happening together there), C2 asks about the next state, which still cannot contain events because event2 was terminal. So C2 remains false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: at the initial state (call it s0) event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens at some state s, then event1 must happen at the next state s+1.
- Rule B: If event1 happens at some state s, then no events can happen at the next state s+1. (I read “no other events can happen” as “no events happen in the immediate next state.”)

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” From s0 this means: event2 happens in s1.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” From s0 this means: in s1 the statement C1 is true — i.e. event2 happens in s2 (two steps from s0).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event1 happened in s0 and Rule B says no events occur in the immediate next state, event2 cannot happen in s1. Therefore C1 (event2 in s1) is false at s0.
- C2 asserts event2 happens in s2. The rules do not force event2 to occur in s2 (they only constrain what must follow if event2 does occur). So C2 is not entailed by the given facts. Concretely: C2 is not true given the context (it may be possible in some hypothetical run, but it does not follow from the premises).

Short answer: C2 is not true (i.e., it does not hold / is not entailed by the given information).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0), event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After any state where event2 happens, the next state must have event1.
- After any state where event1 happens, the next state must have event2.
So the system alternates: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, state2 = event2, state3 = event1, ….

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting “always” in the usual temporal sense (globally, G event2) means event2 holds at every state (now and forever).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” In temporal notation, X(C1) — at the next state, it is true that event2 always happens.

(You mentioned C3 etc.; only C1 and C2 are given here.)

4) How they relate / truth value
- Under the alternating trace, event2 does NOT hold at states where event1 occurs (e.g., state1). Therefore C1 (G event2) is false in the initial state.
- C2 asks whether C1 is true in the next state (state1). At state1 the future still alternates, so event2 is not true at state1 itself; thus C1 is also false at state1. So C2 is false.

Extra note: event2 occurs infinitely often (holds on all even-numbered states), so the weaker property “event2 happens infinitely often” (GF event2) is true, but “event2 always happens” (G event2) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because C1 (G event2) is false already — the trace alternates and event2 does not hold at state1 — so ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1) is false."

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., it is always true that event2 does not happen — equivalently, event2 never occurs at any time.)
- (No C3 was provided.)

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Since event1 has already occurred and the rule says that after event1 event2 must happen, event2 must occur. That makes C1 false.
- Because C1 is false, the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start of the execution (time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: Whenever event1 has happened, event2 must happen afterwards (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- Rule B: After event2 happens, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Together these force every execution to look like: event1 occurs (here, at time 0), then at some later point event2 occurs, and then the execution stops.

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1 is written as ""Event1 always happens."" The natural readings are:
  a) (most likely intended) C1 = ""Event1 has happened (in this execution)"" or equivalently ""event1 occurs in every run"" — a property of the execution that is true once event1 has occurred.
  b) (alternative, less likely) C1 = ""At every time instant event1 occurs"" (i.e. event1 holds at all times, an always/recurrence claim).
- C2 is ""C1 always holds."" That reads as: at every moment in time the proposition C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and whether C2 is true
- Under the natural reading (3a): C1 is true from the initial state because event1 already happened. Once an event has happened, that fact cannot be undone by the given rules (event2 being terminal does not erase the fact that event1 happened). Therefore C1 is true at time 0 and at all later times as well, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is true.
- Under the alternative reading (3b) that C1 means ""event1 occurs at every time instant,"" C1 is false (event1 only occurred initially, not at every instant), hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion
- With the standard/intended interpretation (C1 = ""event1 has happened"" or ""event1 occurs in every execution""), C2 is True.
- If you intended the unusual interpretation that C1 means ""event1 occurs at every moment,"" then C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Reason: read C1 as ""event1 has happened (in this execution)"". That fact holds at time 0 and cannot be undone by the rules, so C1 is true at every later time, hence ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is true. (If C1 were instead read as ""event1 occurs at every instant,"" that reading would make C2 false.)"

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the current/initial state is one where event2 has just occurred).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Means any state reached by event1 is terminal (no outgoing transitions).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Means any state reached by event2 is terminal as well.
- In particular, from the initial state (where event2 happened) there are no further events/transitions.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e. in the immediate successor state of the current state, event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. in every state along the execution, C1 is true — equivalently, at every state the next state has event1.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At the initial state we know event2 happened and the transition rules say no other events can happen after event2. Therefore there is no successor state in which event1 occurs. Under the usual semantics where Xφ (next φ) is false if there is no next state, C1 is false at the initial state.
- Since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

(If you use an alternative semantics that treats ""next"" as vacuously true when there is no successor, state the semantics; with the standard temporal-logical reading used above, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state (where event2 just happened) has no successor, so ""event1 in the next state"" (C1) is false there; therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Answer: C2 is False (under the usual reading). Explanation step by step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event2 has happened (so at the initial moment event2 is true).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, no further events may occur after it.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => event2 is terminal: once event2 occurs, no further events may occur after it.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (both events occur at some points in the execution/history)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there is some time — now or later — when both event2 and event1 have occurred)

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Because event2 has already happened in the initial state and event2 is terminal, no events can occur after that point. So event1 cannot occur after the initial moment.
- There is no information that event1 happened before the initial state; under the usual chronological reading the initial state is the start, so event1 did not occur before.
- Therefore C1 does not hold (both events have not occurred), so C2 (that C1 will eventually hold) is false.

Caveat: If you allow simultaneous occurrences at the initial instant (both event1 and event2 happening at exactly the same time), then C1 would hold immediately and C2 would be true. Under the standard sequential interpretation above, C2 is False.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 follows).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (logical: event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (logical: ¬C1, i.e. neither event2 nor event1 happens).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- We are given event2 has happened, so C1 is true (the disjunction is satisfied by event2).
- Therefore C2, which is the negation of C1, is false.

(Notes: Whether event1 could have happened earlier is irrelevant for C1 because event2 already makes C1 true. The rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" prevents event1 from occurring after event2 but does not affect the truth of C1 here.)

False

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start of the scenario).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (So once event2 has occurred, event1 will occur subsequently.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal — it stops further events.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., event1 never occurs in the run.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted naturally, this says globally (at all times, in the run) event1 never occurs — equivalent to saying event1 never occurs.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Given the initial condition and Rule A, event1 must occur after the initial event2. Therefore C1 (“event1 does not happen”) is false in this scenario.
- Because C1 is false, the claim that C1 always holds (C2) is also false.
- (Also note: C2 implies C1, so if C1 fails, C2 cannot be true.)

Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (i.e., at the start, event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so every time event1 occurs, a later occurrence of event2 is required).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so every time event2 occurs, a later occurrence of event1 is required).

Given the initial event2, these rules force an alternating sequence: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... (i.e., event1 will occur after the initial event2, then event2 after that, etc.).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is the implication event2 → event2. In propositional logic this is a tautology (p → p) and is always true whenever we read it as a standard material implication.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when (a) C1 is true and (b) event1 occurs (at some relevant time).

(There was no C3 given; only C1 and C2 are present.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- C1 is true (tautologically).
- From the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will indeed occur (at least at some later time). Therefore the second conjunct of C2 (“event1 happens”) is satisfied.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true.

Caveat: if by “event1 happens” you meant “had already happened at the initial moment” (i.e., in the past relative to the initial state), then event1 did not yet happen initially and C2 would be false under that strict reading. Under the usual temporal reading (“event1 will happen following the given rules”), C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False (under the natural temporal reading). Full step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: initially, event2 happened (i.e., at the start of the execution/event sequence, event2 occurs).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 follows event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So every allowed execution/trace consistent with the rules is: event2 occurs at the start, then event1, then termination.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Two possible readings:
  a) Strong temporal reading: at every time point (globally) event2 holds — G(event2).
  b) Weaker reading: in every possible execution/event trace, event2 occurs at least once (i.e., event2 occurs in every run).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Typically means C1 is an invariant/always true in time (G(C1)) — i.e., at every time point it is true that C1 holds.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Under the standard temporal interpretation of “always” as “at every time point” (reading 3a): C1 is false because event2 only occurs at the initial moment, not at later times. Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.
- Under the weaker reading (3b) where C1 just means ""in every execution event2 occurs at least once"": C1 is true (the initial condition guarantees event2 occurs in every trace). Then asking whether C1 “always holds” (C2) is a bit redundant — if C1 is a global property of the system (a fact about all traces) it remains true, so C2 would be true under that interpretation. But this is a different use of “always” (quantifying over traces rather than over time points).

Most natural reading of “always happens” in temporal problems is the time-global reading, so the correct answer in that usual sense is: C2 is False.

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state, event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state. (event1 → next event2)
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur in the next state. (event2 → next event1)

From these two rules the system alternates: any state containing event1 is followed by a state containing event2, and any state containing event2 is followed by a state containing event1.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Concretely, from the initial state this asserts next-state(event1).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” This is an implication whose antecedent is C1. There are two natural readings:
  a) Literal reading (same temporal reference): C2 = (C1 → event1 happens in the next state). That is, (next-event1) → (next-event1).
  b) Alternate reading (different temporal reference): C2 = (C1 → event1 happens now/current state).

4) How the conditions relate and final truth values
- From the initial state and Rule B (event2 → next event1), C1 is true: the next state must contain event1.
- Under reading (a), C2 is the formula (next-event1) → (next-event1), which is a tautology (P → P) and thus true.
- Under reading (b), C2 would assert (next-event1) → (current-event1). That is not entailed by the given rules (we know current-event2, not current-event1), so under this interpretation C2 would be false (unless you add extra assumptions).

Conclusion
- C1: True.
- C2: True if you mean “if C1 then event1 (in that same next state)” (tautologically true). False if you intended “if C1 then event1 in the current state” (which is not supported by the premises). If you tell me which temporal reference you mean for the consequent of C2, I’ll give the definitive single answer.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: Interpreting C2 with the same temporal reference as C1 gives (next-event1) → (next-event1), a tautology. (If you instead intended the consequent to refer to the current state, C2 would be False.)"

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (i.e., event1 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward (event2 → event1).
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen after it (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a disjunction asserting at least one of the two events occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1, i.e., neither event2 nor event1 occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event1 has already happened initially, C1 is true (the disjunction is satisfied by event1).
- Therefore C2, which asserts the negation of C1, is false.
- (Note: the terminal rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" simply prevents event2 from occurring after the initial event1, but that does not change that C1 is already satisfied.)

If you intended a different temporal reading of ""happens"" (e.g., only future occurrences, excluding the initial occurrence), tell me and I can re-evaluate.

False.

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual temporal logic reading). Explanation step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 has happened (event2 holds at time 0).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. sometime after an occurrence of event2, event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred the trace has no further events).

(Assumption: “eventually” and “after” are future-oriented as in standard linear-time temporal logic. Also assume events are not required to repeat unless allowed by the rules.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — formally F(event2): true at a state if event2 holds now or at some future state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — formally X(C1) or X(F(event2)): true at the initial state iff in the immediate successor state it is true that event2 holds now or at some future state.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At the initial state (time 0) event2 holds, so C1 (F(event2)) is true at time 0.
- Move to the next state (time 1). By the rules, after event2 we must get event1, and after event1 no further events can occur. Thus at time 1 there is no future time at which event2 will hold (unless you allow additional event2 occurrences before event1; given the stated rules the intended sequence is event2 → event1 → stop). Therefore F(event2) is false at time 1.
- Hence X(F(event2)) (C2) is false at the initial state.

Note on corner cases: if the system allowed event2 to occur again in the future after the next state (i.e. event2 is not strictly one-time and the “after event2” rule does not force an immediate event1 before any further event2), then C2 could be true. But under the natural reading implied by the rules (event2 then event1 then stop), C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 → event2; given event1 is true, event2 will be true at some point.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal; it does not prevent event2 itself from happening.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant formulation; it is logically equivalent to the single proposition ""event2 happens."" So C1 is true exactly when event2 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" In symbolic form C2 = C1 ∨ event2. Since C1 ≡ event2, C2 simplifies to event2 ∨ event2, i.e. simply event2.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- From the initial condition and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 must occur. Therefore event2 is true.
- Since event2 is true, C1 is true (it just says event2), and therefore C2 (which is C1 ∨ event2) is true as well.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state, event2 happened (i.e. event2 holds at time 0).

(Assumption: ""happened"" means it holds at that state; time proceeds from that state.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen. Interpreting “must happen” as “event1 will occur eventually after event2.”
- After event1, no other events can happen. Interpreting this as event1 being a terminal/absorbing state: once event1 occurs, the system stops producing further events.
- Combining these: starting with event2, the system will (eventually) do event1, and then nothing more can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting in standard temporal logic as G(event2) — event2 holds at every (future) state.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreting as F(G(event2)) — there is some point in time after which event2 holds at all subsequent states.

(If you intended different readings of “always” or “eventually,” tell me and I can re-evaluate.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and truth values)?
- From the dynamics, event2 holds at the initial state only, then event1 must occur and the system becomes terminal. So event2 does not hold at states after event1 (indeed no further events occur).
- Therefore C1 (G(event2)) is false: event2 is not true at all times.
- Consequently C2 (F(G(event2))) is also false: there is no future point after which event2 holds forever (after the mandatory event1 the system is terminal and event2 does not hold).

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 holds initially but event1 must occur afterward and then no further events (including event2) can occur. So there is no future point after which event2 holds at all subsequent states, hence F(G(event2)) is false."

Answer: C2 is False (under the usual sequential reading). Explanation step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- If event2 happens, then afterwards event1 must happen (event2 ⇒ later event1).
- If event1 happens, then no other events can happen afterwards (event1 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — i.e., both events occur (possibly at different times).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some point in the run there is a state/time at which C1 is true (i.e., both events have occurred by that time).

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Because event1 has already happened initially and event1 is terminal, no further events (including event2) can occur after the start.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time in the future of the given run, so it is impossible for both event1 and event2 to have occurred in that run.
- Hence C1 does not hold, and therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Remark: The only way to get C2 true would be if you allowed event2 to have occurred at the same instant as the initial event1 (or before the initial moment). With the standard sequential reading given above, that is not the case, so C2 is false.

Answer step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it has already occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This requires that sometime after event1 occurs, event2 will occur.
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" This makes event2 terminal: once event2 occurs, it prevents any further events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (a statement that event2 never occurs)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" That is the conjunction: (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens). This is a direct contradiction.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and to the transition rules)?
- From Rule A and the given initial condition (event1 happened), event2 must occur. So C1 (event2 does not happen) is false under the stated rules.
- C2 asserts both that event2 does not happen and that event2 does happen simultaneously; under classical logic a conjunction containing a statement and its negation is always false.
- Therefore C2 is false. (Even without using Rule A, C2 is self-contradictory and cannot be true in classical logic.)

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
1) Events and initial condition:
- Events: event1, event2.
- Initial: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules:
- Rule A: after event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: after event2, no other events can happen.

3) Interpretations:
- C1: ""event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" = (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens).

4) Reasoning:
- From event1 and Rule A, event2 must occur, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts a contradiction (both event2 and not event2), so C2 is false under classical logic.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 has occurred, event1 will occur sometime afterwards).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur after event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunction; it is equivalent to: event1 happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — since C1 ≡ (event1 happens), C2 ≡ (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens). (There is no C3 given.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial condition, event2 happened.
- From the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 therefore happens (after the initial event2).
- So both event2 and event1 have happened (event2 first, then event1). That makes C2 true.

Note on interpretations: this conclusion assumes ""after event1 no other events can happen"" only forbids events after event1, not before it; since event2 occurred before event1, there is no conflict. Under that natural temporal reading, C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0), event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens in a state s, then event2 must happen in the next state s'.
- If event2 happens in a state s, then event1 must happen in the next state s'.
(Thus under the usual next-state reading the rules enforce alternation: after event2 comes event1, and after event1 comes event2.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — i.e., in s1 (the state immediately following the initial state s0).
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds.” This is simply the conjunction of “event2 happens” with C1. (Effectively it reduces to C1 ∧ event2, so if C1 is false C2 is false.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition (event2 in s0) and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” the next state s1 must have event1, not event2. Therefore C1 is false.
- Because C2 requires C1 to be true (it is C1 ∧ ...), C2 is also false.

Note on alternative semantics: If you allowed both events to occur simultaneously in the next state (i.e., s1 could contain both event1 and event2), then C1 could be true and C2 could be true. But under the standard “next state” / alternation reading (one event required next), C2 is false.

Short answer: C1 is True; C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e. at the start/event2 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events occur afterwards).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — logically equivalent to just ""event2 happens"".
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens AND event2 happens"".

4) How do they relate and final evaluation?
- From the initial condition we know event2 happens, so C1 is true.
- Could event1 have happened? Given event2 happened initially and rule A forbids any events after event2, there is no time for event1 to occur after event2. There is also no earlier time (event2 is initial), so event1 did not occur. Therefore event1 is false, so C2 (event1 ∧ event2) is false.

Note: only under a nonstandard interpretation (e.g. allowing event1 to have occurred before the initial moment, or allowing simultaneous occurrences in a way that circumvents the ""after"" constraints) could C2 possibly be true. Under the normal temporal reading above, C2 is False.

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened (so we start in a state after event2).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — whenever event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 must occur (at least in the immediate next step or eventually depending on intended semantics; minimally it forces a successor with event2).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — a state following event2 is terminal: there are no successor states with any events.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is redundant; both disjuncts are the same, so C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, C1 is true.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- We start in a state after event2, and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" makes that state terminal (no next state).
- Therefore there is no successor state in which event1 could hold. Under the usual semantics for a ""next"" operator (X φ is false at a state with no successor), C2 is false.
- Even treating ""no successor"" as ""there is no next state to satisfy C1"", C2 cannot be true.

So C2 is False (unless you adopt a nonstandard semantics that treats ""next at terminal"" differently).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Justification: we start in a state after event2, and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" makes that state terminal (no successor). C1 just says ""event1"", so ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1) is false under the usual next-state semantics when there is no successor. (Only under a nonstandard semantics that treats next-at-terminal differently could it be true.)"

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
So the system forces an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This means there exists some time (now or later) at which event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Equivalently, C2 = ¬C1 (event1 never happens).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 is already satisfied (and, given the alternation, event1 will occur repeatedly in the future as well). Even under the stricter reading of ""eventually"" meaning strictly in the future, the alternation guarantees event1 will occur again after event2.
- Therefore C1 is true, so C2 (the negation) is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so the state immediately after the state where event2 happened contains event1).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so the state after the state where event1 happens has no events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Interpreted as a conjunction that both events occur (each at some state). If interpreted as a state-local proposition, it means both happen in the same state; if interpreted as a trace-level proposition it means both occur somewhere along the execution.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asserts that in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true (i.e., in the next state both event2 and event1 happen, under the state-local reading).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C2 true or false?
- Timeline under the rules: initial state = event2 happened. The next state = event1 happens (by Rule A). Thereafter no further events (by Rule B).
- In the next state we have event1, but not event2 (event2 occurred in the previous state). Therefore the conjunction ""event2 and event1"" is not true in that next state.
- So C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False under the standard reading where ""eventX happens"" is true only in the state where that event occurs.

(If you instead meant C1 as a trace-level statement “both events occur somewhere in the trace,” then that global C1 is true, but C2 — the claim that that global C1 is already true in the next state as a state-local claim — is still false. The only way C2 would be true is if event2 and event1 could both hold simultaneously in the same next state, which contradicts the given “after” ordering.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

In the next state only event1 occurs (event2 occurred in the previous state), so the state-local conjunction ""event2 and event1"" (C1) is not true there."

Short answer: C1 is True and C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So in every run/state we consider, event1 has already occurred at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" → event2 is terminal: once event2 occurs, the system stops (no further events).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → event1 is also terminal: once event1 occurs, the system stops (no further events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the initial condition (event1 happened initially), C1 holds: event1 occurs in every run (it already happened).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This claims that because event1 always happens, event2 will happen somewhere.

4) How do these conditions relate?
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal. Because event1 has already happened initially and it is terminal (""after event1, no other events can happen""), no further events can ever occur in any run. Therefore event2 cannot happen after event1. There is no provision that event2 happened before event1 (the scenario says event1 is initial), and simultaneous occurrence is not implied. So C2, which asserts event2 happens given C1, is false.

Edge note: Only if you allowed event2 to have occurred before the initial event1, or allowed simultaneous occurrence, could C2 become possible. Under the given plain reading, C2 is False.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Given Rule B and the initial event1, no further events (including event2) can occur after the start. So event2 never actually happens in any run that begins with the given initial condition.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the logical implication p ⇒ p (where p is ""event2 happens""). p ⇒ p is a tautology — it is always true (true whether or not p actually occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This asserts that C1 is false.

4) How they relate
- Since C1 is a tautology, C1 holds regardless of the transition rules or whether event2 can occur. Therefore C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False. C1 (the implication ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"", p⇒p) is a tautology, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the current (initial) state, event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., the next state after an event1-state must be an event2-state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., the next state after an event2-state must be an event1-state).
(I'm assuming “after” means the immediate next state.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — a proposition that is true in a state exactly when event1 does not occur in that state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the state immediately following the current one, event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation of C2
- At the current (initial) state event2 happened. By the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” the next state must be one where event1 happens.
- Therefore in the next state event1 does happen, so C1 (event1 does not happen) is false in that next state.
- Hence C2 (“C1 holds in the next state”) is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

(If “after” were intended to mean “eventually sometime later” rather than the immediate next state, the evaluation could change for statements about the immediate next state; the conclusion above assumes the usual immediate-next interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the current state has event2, and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces the immediate next state to have event1. Thus ""event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false in the next state, so C2 is false."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
(Interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs, the next state must have event1; whenever event1 occurs, the next state must have event2.)

3) Sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., event1 does not happen in the next state).

4) Relation and evaluation
- Since initially event2 has happened and the rule says “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 must occur in the next state. So C1 is true.
- C2 asserts the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

(If instead “must happen” were read as only “eventually must happen” rather than “in the next state,” the truth of C1 would be indeterminate; under the usual reading that links “after” to the immediate next state, C1 true and C2 false.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., event2 is inevitable once event1 has occurred).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible execution/run of the system (given the stated initial condition and rules), event2 will occur.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" A conjunction: (a) event1 occurs, and (b) the statement C1 is true.

(There is no C3 given.)

4) How they relate, and final verdict
- The initial condition gives event1 happened.
- By Rule A, once event1 has happened, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 occurs in every run consistent with the premises, so C1 is true.
- Since event1 did happen (initial condition) and C1 holds, the conjunction C2 is true.

Note on interpretation: this conclusion assumes ""must happen"" expresses inevitability (liveness) rather than some weaker possibility. If ""always happens"" were meant in a different technical sense (e.g., ""at every time point event2 holds""), the reading would change; under the natural reading above, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 has occurred (initial condition), and Rule A makes event2 inevitable after event1, so event2 occurs in every run (C1 true). Thus event1 and C1 hold, so C2 is true."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened (so the initial state is one where event2 holds).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — any state in which event1 has happened is terminal (it has no successor states).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — any state in which event2 has happened is terminal (it has no successor states).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — both events occur (this can be read as ""both hold in some state"" or ""both have occurred at some point in the run"").
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the immediate successor state (the next state after the current one) satisfies C1.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- The initial state has event2 and, by the second rule, is terminal (there is no next state).
- Therefore there is no ""next state"" in which C1 could hold, so the statement ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false.
- Also, under the common reading that the initial state only has event2 (and no earlier event1), C1 itself is false. (Even if you allowed both events to hold simultaneously in the initial state so C1 were true now, there still is no successor state, so C2 would remain false.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true at the start (and therefore has happened).

2) Transition/closure rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Means if event2 occurs, no further events can occur. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 never needs to occur given the initial condition.)

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition that event1 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the negation of C1; it asserts that event1 does not eventually happen.

4) How do they relate?
- From the initial fact (event1 happened) we conclude C1 is true. C2 is the negation of that, so C2 is false. There is no model consistent with the context in which C1 is false, because the context explicitly states event1 occurred initially.

Step 2 — transition rules

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual sequential reading). Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 occurs at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has happened, no subsequent event (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Similarly, if event2 happens, no subsequent events can occur.
(So each of event1 and event2 is terminal: once it occurs, it prevents any later events.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This requires both events to have happened (at some times).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""(event2 happens and event1 happens) and event1 happens"", i.e. simply ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" (repeating event1 adds nothing).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / final evaluation?
- From (1) and (2): event1 has occurred initially. Because ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event2) can occur after that initial event1.
- There is no earlier time given where event2 could have happened (the word ""initially"" places event1 at the start), so under the standard sequential interpretation event2 does not happen.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 and event2 happen"") is false, and hence C2 (which is equivalent to C1) is also false.

Caveat: If you allow events to be simultaneous at the initial moment and both event1 and event2 could occur at that same instant, then C1 (and therefore C2) could be true, because the prohibition only forbids events after one has occurred, not at the same instant. But with the usual reading (""event1 happened initially, then no other events can happen afterward""), C2 is False.

Step 0 — assumptions and notation
- Call the initial state S0 and the next state S1.
- “Happened” means “occurs in that state” (instantaneous events).
- I read “After event1, no other events can happen” as: once event1 has occurred (in S0), no events at all can occur in any later state (S1, S2, …). If you intended a different reading, see the alternate-case note at the end.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in S0, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 happens, no events can happen in subsequent states (S1, S2, …) — i.e., S0 is a terminal point for events.
- Rule B: After event2 happens, event1 must happen in a later state. (This only matters if event2 ever occurs.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” — i.e., event1 occurs in S1.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., event1 does not occur in S1 (the negation of C1).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what follows?
- Because event1 already happened in S0 and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no event (including event1 again) can occur in S1. Therefore C1 is false in S1.
- Since C2 is the negation of C1, C2 is true.

Conclusion
- C2 is True (given the natural reading that no events at all can occur after event1).

Alternate reading note
- If instead “no other events can happen” was meant to forbid only events different from event1 but still allow event1 to re-occur in later states, then C1 could be true (and C2 false). The answer above assumes the common interpretation that after event1 nothing further happens.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 occurred in S0 and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" forbids any events in S1, so C1 (event1 in S1) is false and its negation C2 is true."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we are in the state after event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal/absorbing).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal/absorbing).
- Therefore, once we are in the state after either event, there are no subsequent events.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1 is written as “Event1 happens or event1 happens,” which is equivalent to “Event1 happens” (redundant disjunction).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” means “in the immediate successor state, Event1 happens.”

(If your formalism treats a state with no successor as making “next” false, use that; other semantics that treat “next” differently should be noted — see the final remark.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- We start in the state after event2. Because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur in the current state or any later state.
- Hence C1 (Event1 happens) is false in the initial state.
- There is no successor state in which Event1 happens, so C2 (“C1 holds in the next state”) is false.

Remark: If you actually intended C1 to be “Event1 happens or Event2 happens,” then C1 would be true in the initial state (because event2 happened), but C2 would still be false because there is no next state where that disjunction becomes true again.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 has already happened.

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, then the next occurrence must be event2.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred, no further events are allowed after it.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (Claim that in the state immediately following the initial state, event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (Claim that event1 happens next AND event2 also happens — implicitly in some following state or together with C1; in any case C2 requires C1 to be true.)

(There is no C3 given.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event2 already happened in the initial state and Rule B disallows any further events after event2, no events can occur in the next state. Therefore event1 cannot occur in the next state, so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to be true (and also that event2 happens). Since C1 is false, C2 is false as well.

Edge note on ambiguity: if one tried to interpret ""no other events can happen"" as allowing event2 to repeat but disallowing only events different from event2, C1 is still impossible (it is a different event), so C1 remains false and therefore C2 remains false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (constraints)
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, neither event2 nor anything else can occur thereafter).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (irrelevant here unless event2 happens).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some future time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event1 occurs, then event2 will eventually occur (implication).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Given the initial state, event1 has happened. The rule “after event1, no other events can happen” prohibits any future occurrence of event2. Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not eventually happen).
- C2 is the implication (event1 → event2 eventually). Here the antecedent (event1 happened) is true, but the consequent (event2 eventually happens) is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C2 is False. (If instead event1 never happened, C2 would be vacuously true, but under the given initial condition it is false.)

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (call this time/state t0): event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs at some state, event2 must occur at the next state.
- After event2 occurs at some state, event1 must occur at the next state.
So the system alternates: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 ...

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at t0, C1 asserts event1 occurs at t1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted at t0, C2 asserts that at t1 the statement C1 is true — i.e., that event1 happens at t2. (Equivalently, C2 means event1 occurs two steps from now.)

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From t0: event2 (given) ⇒ by the rule, at t1 event1 occurs. So C1 is true.
- From t1: event1 ⇒ by the rule, at t2 event2 occurs. Therefore event1 does not occur at t2, so C1 is false at t1.
- Since C2 asserts C1 holds at t1, and C1 is false at t1, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: t0: event2. By the rules t1: event1 (so C1 is true at t0). But at t1 event1 implies t2: event2, so event1 does not occur at t2; hence C1 is false at t1, so C2 (which asserts C1 at t1) is false."

I'll go through the four parts step by step and then give the truth value of C2 under the reasonable interpretations.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (call that time t0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 happens, event2 must happen next.
- Rule B: After event2 happens, event1 must happen next.
Together these force an alternating sequence of events. Given the initial event2 at t0, the forced sequence is:
t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ... (alternating indefinitely).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
  This is ambiguous; there are at least two natural readings:
  a) Propositional/logical reading: ""event2 → event2"" as a logical implication about the same occurrence. This is a logical tautology (p → p), so it is always true.
  b) Temporal reading (two variants):
     - Next-step reading: ""If event2 happens now, then event2 happens next (immediately after)."" This asserts the next event after an event2 is another event2.
     - Eventually/future reading: ""If event2 happens now, then at some future time event2 will happen (again)."" This asserts that event2 will occur again later.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the negation of whatever interpretation of C1 we take.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? (and truth of C2)
Evaluate C1 under the interpretations above, then C2 (the negation):

- Under the propositional/logical reading (event2 → event2 as same time):  
  C1 is true (tautology). Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

- Under the temporal next-step reading (next after event2 is event2):  
  Given the transition rules, after event2 the next event must be event1, not event2. So C1 is false, and therefore C2 is true.

- Under the temporal eventually/future reading (event2 will occur again sometime later):  
  Given the alternating rules and the initial event2, event2 does indeed recur (t2, t4, ...). So C1 is true, and C2 is false.

Summary (direct answer): Whether C2 is True or False depends on how you read C1.
- If C1 is read as a plain logical tautology or as ""event2 will eventually occur again,"" then C1 is true and C2 is false.
- If C1 is read as ""event2 implies event2 occurs next"" (i.e., next-step), then C1 is false and C2 is true.

If you tell me which interpretation of ""then event2 happens"" you intended (logical, next-step, or eventually), I can give a single definitive truth value.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Under the natural (logical or eventual) reading, C1 (""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"") is true (a tautology / event2 recurs in the alternating sequence), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (this is given as the initial fact).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen.
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (Both events occur at some point.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (For example, in temporal logic: at all times, C1 is true — equivalently, C1 is true in the actual run/trace being considered.)

4) How they relate and the conclusion
- Since event2 has happened initially, Rule A prevents any other event from happening after that point. That rules out event1 occurring after event2. There is no earlier time for event1 (event2 is initial), so under the usual reading event1 cannot occur at all. Therefore C1 is false (both events do not occur). If C1 is false, then C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Note on alternative reading: If you allowed simultaneous/coincident events at the same instant and interpreted ""after event2 no other events can happen"" as only prohibiting strictly later events, then one could imagine event1 happening exactly at the same instant as event2 and C1 being true. But under the standard sequential interpretation implied by the problem (event2 happened initially and thereafter no events can occur), C1 is false and so C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 is given as already happened and it prevents any other events thereafter, so event1 cannot occur; thus C1 is false and therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

I'll assume a standard linear time interpretation: ""after X"" means at a later time than X, and ""initially"" means X has already happened at the start, so no earlier events are possible.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the initial time.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: once it has occurred, nothing else can occur later.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time t, then at some later time t' > t, event1 must occur.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Logically this is just event2 ∧ event2, which is equivalent to event2. So C1 is true exactly when event2 happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is equivalent to event2, C2 is (event2) ∧ (event2), again equivalent to event2. So C2 is also true exactly when event2 happens.

4) How they relate and the final answer
- Because event1 happened initially and Rule A says no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 does not happen; hence C1 is false and C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event1 will happen sometime after event2).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — interpreted as the usual future temporal meaning F(event2): from the current moment there is some (current or future) time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — interpreted as G(F(event2)): at every moment in time, event2 will (again) occur at some future time.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At the initial moment C1 is true because event2 already happened.
- But after event2 the system must do event1, and after event1 no further events can happen. In the state after event1 there is no future occurrence of event2, so F(event2) is false at that point.
- Therefore G(F(event2)) is false: there exists a reachable state (the post-event1 state) where C1 does not hold.

Conclusion: C2 (i.e. ""C1 always holds"") is False.

Note: If you instead meant C1 as a past property (""event2 has happened at some time in the past or present"") then C1 would remain true forever after the initial occurrence and C2 would be true. But under the standard future/“eventually” reading used above, C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 implies event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, nothing else follows).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunction; logically C1 ≡ (event1 happens).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. event2 → C1, equivalently event2 → event1.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the rule, event2 → event1, and we know event2 did happen, so event1 happens. Hence C1 is true.
- C2 is the implication event2 → C1. Here the antecedent (event2) is true and the consequent (C1/event1) is true, so the implication is true.
- (Note: even in general, an implication is true vacuously if the antecedent is false; but in this scenario the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, so C2 is true.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has already happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).
Because event1 already happened initially and it forbids any further events, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Formally: there exists some time (now or in the future) at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Formally: there exists some future time at which the statement C1 is true — i.e., at that future time it is true that event2 will (from that time) eventually happen.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Given the initial terminal event1, event2 cannot occur at any time, so C1 is false at every time point.
- Since C1 is never true, there is no future time at which C1 holds, so C2 is also false.
- (Note: in temporal-logic terms F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1; both are false here.)

Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at least once).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 has happened, a subsequent event2 will occur).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 is followed by event1).
- Together these imply an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 … ; in particular, since event1 already happened, event2 will (must) happen next (or at least at some later point).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is redundant; logically C1 ≡ (event2 happens). Conjunction of the same proposition with itself is just that proposition.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Substituting the simplification for C1 yields C2 ≡ (event2 happens) ∨ (event2 happens) ≡ (event2 happens). So C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- From the initial event1 and the transition rule, event2 must happen. Therefore the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true.
- Since C1 and C2 both simplify to ""event2 happens,"" both C1 and C2 are true.
- Answer: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially (in the starting state) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” → event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” → event2 is terminal: once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (i.e. in the state immediately following the initial state.)
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens.” This is a disjunction that effectively says “event1 happens (in the next state) OR event1 happens” — in other words C2 is true exactly when event1 happens in the next state (no extra cases are introduced by the redundant disjunct).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because the initial state already has event2 and “after event2 no other events can happen,” there can be no further events in the next state. Therefore event1 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- Since C2 is just a disjunction that is true only if event1 happens in the next state, and event1 does not happen there, C2 is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False. (If one interprets the second disjunct of C2 to mean “event1 happens at any time” the same reasoning still applies: once event2 has happened and it forbids any subsequent events, event1 cannot occur later, so C2 remains false.)

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (so at time 0 the system is in a state where event2 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen next.
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen next.
So the system forces an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … (event2 at time 0, event1 at time 1, event2 at time 2, etc.).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is written as “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is redundant as written; interpreted literally it is equivalent to “Event2 happens” (the conjunction of the same proposition twice adds nothing).
- C2 is “C1 always holds” — i.e. C1 holds at every time/state (globally).

(If you intended a different temporal meaning for C1 — for example “event2 happens now AND event2 happens again later” — that is a different formula; I address that alternate reading below.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true or false?
- Under the natural literal reading (C1 ≡ “event2 holds at the current state”): C1 is true exactly at the states where event2 occurs (times 0, 2, 4, …) and false at the states where event1 occurs (times 1, 3, 5, …). C2 (“C1 always holds”) would require event2 to hold at every time, which is not the case because event1 must occur between event2 occurrences. Therefore C2 is False. A concrete counterexample: at time 1 event1 holds and event2 does not, so C1 is false there, so C2 fails.

- Alternate reading (if C1 was intended to mean “event2 occurs now AND event2 occurs at some future time” or “event2 now AND eventually event2”): from any state (whether event2 or event1) the rules guarantee an event2 will occur again in the future (because events alternate), so that version of C1 would hold at every state and C2 would be True. 

Conclusion: With the straightforward literal reading of the given C1, C2 is False. If C1 was intended to assert the existence of some future event2 in addition to a current one, then C2 would be True — so clarify the intended temporal meaning if you meant something else.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 True or False?
- Logically, C2 asserts both E2 and ¬E2 simultaneously, which is a contradiction and therefore always false (unsatisfiable).
- From the context/rules, since event1 happened and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" E2 must indeed occur; so C1 (¬E2) is false. Thus C2 = false ∧ true = false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred (that is given).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (So whenever event1 has occurred, event2 is required to occur next.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (Two readings: (i) in the given scenario/trace that starts with the stated initial condition, event2 will occur; (ii) as a global claim that in every possible run of the system event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" That requires both that C1 is true and that event2 actually occurs in the run under consideration.

Step 4 — how they relate and the verdict
- From the given initial condition plus Rule A, event2 is required to happen in this run. So event2 happens (true).
- If C1 is read with respect to the given scenario/trace (reading (i)), it is true because the rules force event2 after the stated initial event1. Therefore both parts of C2 are true and C2 is true.
- If C1 is read as the stronger global claim (reading (ii)) — ""in every possible run/event sequence event2 happens"" — you cannot conclude C1 from the provided information (you only know about the run that starts with event1), so C1 would be unsupported and C2 would be false (or at least not provable).

Final answer (most natural reading given the context): C2 is True — because event1 has occurred and the rules force event2, so event2 happens and the claim that event2 happens (C1, interpreted for this scenario) holds. If you intended the global reading of ""always"" apply to all possible runs, tell me and I will re-evaluate under that interpretation.

Step 0 — assumption
- I read ""next state"" relative to the given initial state (the state immediately after the initial one where event2 happened). I also read the OR in C2 as the usual inclusive logical OR.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- So the system alternates: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e., at the immediate next point in time relative to the initial state.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Interpreted as: (event2 happens next) OR (event1 happens next).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and which is true?
- From the initial condition (event2 now) and the transition rules, the next state must be event1.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen next).
- But ""event1 happens next"" is true, so C2 = (C1 OR event1 happens next) = (false OR true) = true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules / constraints
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” Once event1 occurs, the system stops — no further events occur.
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” Similarly, if event2 occurs, no further events occur.
Given the initial condition (event1 already happened), nothing else can happen after the start.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” This asserts that at some point in the timeline (including the initial moment) event1 occurs.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” This is simply the negation of C1.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Since event1 happened initially, C1 is true (the occurrence has already happened).
- Therefore C2, being the negation of C1, is false.

Note on semantics: If “eventually” were interpreted to mean strictly in the future excluding the initial moment, one might say “event1 eventually happens” is false because no further events occur after the initial state. But in standard use of “eventually” (or temporal “eventually” that includes the current moment), the initial occurrence satisfies C1, so C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already happened initially, so C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true; therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition / occurrence rules
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to just ""Event2 happens"" (A or A = A).
- C2 is ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as the universal/temporal operator (C1 holds at all relevant times), C2 asserts that event2 happens (now or at some time?) in the required sense at every point considered.

4) How they relate / final inference
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no other event (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 does not happen.
- Hence C1 is false, and so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

If you intended a different reading of ""initially"" or ""always"" (for example allowing events before the initial time, or a different temporal scope), tell me and I can re-evaluate under that semantics.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Since event1 happens initially and after event1 no other events can occur, event2 never happens. Thus C1 (""event2"") is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

I'll answer each part step by step and then give the conclusion about C2.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initial state) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
- Combined with the initial event2, these rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... forever.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (Interpretation used below: C1 means globally/eventually at every time point event1 holds — i.e. in every state event1 is true.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Formally: (event1_now) OR (C1). That is, in a given state C2 is true if either event1 holds in that state, or C1 is true (event1 holds in all states).

(If you meant different formal meanings for ""always"" or ""happens"", tell me and I can re-evaluate.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and is C2 true or false?
- Because the system alternates and the initial state is event2, event1 does not hold in the initial state; it holds in the next state, then not in the next, and so on.
- C1 (event1 in every state) is false: there are states (e.g., the initial state) where event1 is not true.
- C2 at a given state is true iff either event1 holds in that state, or C1 holds. Since C1 is false, C2 reduces to ""event1 holds in that state.""
- Therefore:
  - At states where event1 occurs, C2 is true.
  - At states where event2 occurs (including the initial state), C2 is false.
- In particular, C2 is not globally true. Evaluated at the initial state it is false.

Short answer: C2 is sometimes true (exactly in the states where event1 happens) and sometimes false (in the states where event2 happens). It is not always true; specifically it is false initially.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Initially event2 holds, so event1 does not hold. C1 (""event1 always"") is false (since event1 fails initially). Thus C2 (event1_now OR C1) is false in the initial state."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state S0, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given, interpreted in the usual “occurrence in a state” way)
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs in some state, then event1 must occur subsequently — typically interpreted as in the next state.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (If event1 occurs in a state, then in all following states no events occur.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” — i.e., event1 occurs in S1 (the state immediately after S0).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., event1 does not occur in S1.

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- At S0 event1 happened. By Rule B, after event1 no other events can happen, so S1 contains no events (neither event1 nor event2).
- Therefore event1 does not happen in S1, so C1 is false.
- Consequently C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is true.

Note on alternate readings: If you instead treat “event1 happened” as a persistent property that remains true in subsequent states, the conclusion could change (C1 true, C2 false). But under the standard reading where “happened” refers to an occurrence in a particular state and Rule B forbids any further events, C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” That asserts event1 occurs at time t+1 (one step after the current state).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That asserts that at time t+1 the statement C1 is true — equivalently, C2 requires that event1 happens at time t+2 (two steps after the current state).

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because the initial state already has event2 and event2 forbids any further events, no events (in particular event1) can occur in any future state.
- Therefore C1 (“event1 at t+1”) is false.
- Since C2 requires event1 at t+2, it is also false.

So C2 is False (and C1 is also False). Note: if one used a semantics where a non-existent “next state” makes next-formulas undefined rather than true, the practical conclusion is the same: C1 and C2 are not true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true in the scenario).

2) Transition rules
- “After event1, event2 must happen” — this is a rule that whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward (i.e., event1 ⇒ event2).
- “After event2, no other events can happen” — event2 is terminal; nothing else follows it. (This does not prevent event2 from happening.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the rule event1 ⇒ event2.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is a logical disjunction: (event2) ∨ (C1).

(You mentioned C3, but none was defined in the problem.)

4) How the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- From the context we have both: event1 happened, and the rule says event1 ⇒ event2, so event2 does happen. Thus event2 is true in the scenario.
- C1 is also true because the context gives the rule event1 ⇒ event2.
- C2 is a disjunction of two true propositions (event2 is true and C1 is true), so C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., sometime after a state with event2, a state with event1 must occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" in the usual temporal/logical sense (globally), C1 means: in every state from now on event2 holds (symbolically G event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means: in the immediate next state, C1 is true (symbolically X (G event2)).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- A possible (and forced) timeline consistent with the rules is:
  s0 (initial): event2
  s1: event1 (must follow s0)
  s2: no events (because after event1 no events can occur)
- Evaluate C1 at s0: G event2 is false because at s1 (and s2) event2 does not hold.
- Evaluate C2 at s0: X(G event2) asks whether G event2 is true at s1; it is not. So C2 is false.

Note: if you meant ""always"" to mean ""happens at least once (eventually)"" rather than ""holds at every future state"", the truth values change — with that reading event2 does occur at s0, so ""event2 eventually happens"" would be true at s0, but the standard reading of ""always"" (globally) makes C1 false and thus C2 false.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (Negation of C1.)

4) How they relate / truth evaluation
- Because event2 occurred initially and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" blocks any subsequent events, event1 cannot occur at any time in this scenario.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Since event1 never occurs, the antecedent of C1 is false, so C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time t0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur at some later time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur at some later time.

(Interpreting ""must happen"" as an eventuality obligation: the system will produce the required future occurrences.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (There is at least one occurrence of each.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (Equivalent to: event2 happens OR (event1 and event2) — which simplifies to just event2 happens, since event2 is common to both disjuncts.)

4) How they relate / inference
- From the initial event1 (t0) and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will occur at some later time (say t1). So event2 does happen.
- Because event2 happens, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ensures event1 happens again (t2), and so on.
- Therefore both event1 and event2 occur at least once, so C1 is true.
- Since event2 happens, the disjunction C2 (C1 OR event2) is true (it would be true even if C1 were false, because event2 alone makes the disjunction true).

Conclusion: C2 is True. (If one instead allowed the rules to be violated so that ""must happen"" could be ignored, the answer might differ — but under the given semantics of required eventual occurrences, C2 is true.)

True

Reason: event1 occurs initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur; thus the disjunction C2 (C1 or event2) is satisfied."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the run begins with event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the same run, event1 occurs at some point after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the run ends after event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted in the natural reading of the provided scenario, this says event2 occurs in the run. (If one instead reads “always” as “at every moment” or “in every possible run,” that would be a different, stronger reading — see caveat below.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 requires both that event2 occurs (C1) and that event1 occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial condition we have event2 occurring, so C1 is satisfied under the usual reading.
- From the transition rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 does indeed occur.
- Therefore both conjuncts of C2 are true, so C2 is true.

Caveat about “always”: if C1 is intended to mean “event2 occurs at every timepoint” or “in every possible execution,” you would need a different model to evaluate that stronger claim. Under the ordinary interpretation tied to the given single run (event2 happened initially), C1 is true and thus C2 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 has already happened (at the initial moment).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After E2 occurs, E1 must occur (so any occurrence of E2 is followed sometime later by E1).
- After E1 occurs, E2 must occur (so E1 is followed sometime later by E2).
- These rules produce an alternating sequence: E2 (initial) → E1 → E2 → E1 → … (each occurrence forces the next).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is a disjunction: C1 is true if at least one of E2 or E1 occurs (at any point in the timeline/trace you are considering).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This is true when (a) E1 happens (somewhere in the timeline) and (b) C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because E2 already happened initially, C1 is immediately true (E2 satisfies the disjunction).
- The transition rules guarantee that E1 will happen after that initial E2, so E1 does occur as well.
- Therefore both parts of C2 hold: E1 happens, and C1 holds. So under the usual interpretation of ""happens"" meaning “occurs at some point in the run,” C2 is True.

Caveat (clarifying a possible alternate reading)
- If you interpret the predicates as ""has already happened up to the initial moment"" (i.e., evaluating truth right now before the forced E1 occurs), then:
  - C1 is true (because E2 already happened),
  - but C2 would be false at that instant because E1 has not yet happened.
- Under the common temporal/existential reading (something “happens” at some time in the execution), C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: E2 has already happened, so C1 (""E2 or E1 happens"") is true. The transition rules force E1 to occur after E2, so E1 does happen. Therefore C2 (""E1 happens and C1 holds"") is true (under the usual reading that ""happens"" means ""occurs at some point in the run"")."

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition/constraint rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. => once event1 occurs, the run ends (no event2 can occur later).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. => any run that contains an event2 must also contain a subsequent event1.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (read as: event2 occurs in the run — or in every run, an occurrence of event2 happens.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (read as: it is always the case that C1 is true — equivalently, in every run event2 happens.)

4) How they relate / conclusion
- Because event1 has already occurred initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no event2 can occur in this system. Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not occur), and so C2 (that C1 always holds) is also false.

(If you meant a different reading of ""after"" — e.g., allowing events to occur before the initial event1 — mention that and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

Short answer: C2 is False (under the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (the system starts in a state where event2 occurred).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: if it occurs, no further events can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is also terminal: once it occurs, no further events can occur afterward.

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — the conjunction that both events occur (at some times; typically interpreted as both having occurred at some point in the run).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some (initial or future) time the condition C1 becomes true (i.e., there is a point in the execution where both events have happened).

4) How do these relate and conclusion?
- The system starts with event2 already having happened. Because event2 is terminal (""after event2 no other events can happen""), no further events (including event1) can occur after the initial point. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later time, so it is impossible for both event1 and event2 to hold in the same run.
- Hence C1 is false in every reachable state, and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Note on alternative readings: If one allowed event1 to have occurred before the initial state or allowed simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment, the answer could change; under the usual forward-in-time/initial-state interpretation above, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because the system starts with event2 already having occurred and both event1 and event2 are terminal (no events can follow them), event1 cannot occur after the initial state, so the conjunction ""event1 and event2"" can never hold at any point."

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur following event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" (i.e., ¬event2 ∧ event2).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition, event2 happened, so C1 (¬event2) is false.
- C2 is a conjunction of ¬event2 and event2, which is a logical contradiction and therefore false.
- Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 is (¬event2 ∧ event2), a contradiction, so it cannot be true (and given the initial condition event2 did happen, ¬event2 is false)."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, no subsequent event—including event2—can occur.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (a material implication: event1 → event2)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (C2 = event2 ∧ C1)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Given the initial condition, event1 did happen. By Rule A, no other events can happen after that, so event2 does not happen.
- C1 is an implication whose antecedent (event1) is true but whose consequent (event2) is false; therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires both event2 to happen and C1 to be true. Since event2 does not happen and C1 is false, C2 is false.

(If you allow simultaneous or non-temporal interpretations of ""after,"" the answer could differ; under the ordinary temporal reading above, C2 is false.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (initially event1 happened).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Logically this is equivalent to just ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction of the same proposition is idempotent).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event1 does not happen"" under the standard reading.

(If one meant the conjunct to require two distinct occurrences of event1, that is a different, nonstandard reading; under that reading the context only guarantees one initial occurrence so C1 would be false. But in usual propositional logic the two conjuncts are identical and C1 is true.)

4) How the conditions relate
- The context asserts event1 did happen, so C1 (equivalent to ""event1 happened"") is true.
- Therefore C2, which asserts that C1 does not hold, is false.
- The facts about event2 and no further events do not change this conclusion.

Conclusion: Under the standard logical reading, C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So from the initial state where event2 has happened, event1 will inevitably occur.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction; it is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Substituting C1, C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens and Event1 happens,"" i.e. just ""Event1 happens.""

(There is no C3 given.)

4) How the conditions relate and truth value
- From the initial condition and the rule ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 does indeed happen.
- Therefore C1 is true (since it asserts event1), and C2 is true (since it asserts event1 and C1, both true).

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 occurs. C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens,"" and C2 is ""event1 happens and C1,"" so C2 is true."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (state s0): event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2 happens, no further events happen in subsequent states.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at s0, C1 asks whether event1 occurs in s1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted at s0, C2 asks whether C1 is true at s1 — i.e., at s1, does event1 happen in s2?

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Timeline from the rules:
  - s0: event1 (given)
  - s1: event2 (required after event1)
  - s2: no events (since after event2 no events can happen)
- Evaluate C1 at s0: C1 asks whether event1 occurs in s1. s1 has event2, not event1 → C1 is False.
- Evaluate C2 at s0: C2 asks whether C1 holds at s1. At s1, C1 would require event1 in s2, but s2 has no events → C1 is False at s1, hence C2 is False.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (i.e., any execution in which event1 occurs is required to have event2 at some later point.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual temporal sense: in every possible execution (given the stated initial condition and rules) event2 occurs at some point.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" That asserts event1 occurred and event2 occurs in all executions.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- We are given event1 happened initially. By Rule A, once event1 has happened, event2 must occur. So in every allowed execution consistent with the premises, event2 will indeed occur (because event1 already occurred). Therefore C1 is true.
- Since event1 did happen and C1 holds, C2 is true.

Note on ambiguity: This conclusion assumes the plain meanings ""must happen"" = necessarily occurs and ""always happens"" = occurs in every execution.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred, no further events occur in any later state.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" in the usual temporal sense (holds at all times / in every state on the trace). So C1 requires event1 to be true in the initial state and every state thereafter.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, at the state immediately after the initial state, the formula C1 is true (so from that next state onward, event1 would have to hold at every state).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 already happened in the initial state and Rule B says no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur in any later state. Also the initial state does not have event1 (only event2 is stated to have happened initially), so C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false already at the initial state.
- Since C1 is false at the initial state, it is also false to claim C1 holds in the next state: in the next state no events can occur (by Rule B), so event1 will not hold there either, so C1 is false at that next state.

Therefore C2 (the claim that C1 holds in the next state) is false.

(If you intended different semantics—e.g., events may co-occur in a state, or ""after"" means something other than “immediately next state”—say so and I’ll re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 already holds in the initial state and Rule B forbids any events thereafter, so event1 cannot hold at every time (it doesn't hold initially and cannot hold in later states). Therefore C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has just happened (so the system starts right after event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. at some later point following an occurrence of event2, event1 occurs).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. at some later point following an occurrence of event1, event2 occurs).

(Interpreting “must happen” as “will occur next/at some later time” — either way the rules force alternation.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (There exists a future moment with event1.)
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” This is the conjunction of C1 and the plain statement “event1 happens.” Concretely, C2 is true exactly when event1 does occur (because if event1 occurs then C1 is satisfied; and if event1 does not occur, neither conjunct holds).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial state (event2 just happened) and Rule A, event1 must occur next (or at least at some future point). Therefore C1 is true.
- Since event1 does in fact occur (by the transition rule), the second part of C2 (“event1 happens”) is also true.
- Hence both conjuncts of C2 are true, so C2 is true.

Note on ambiguity: if “event1 happens” in C2 were intended to mean “event1 happened already in the past (before the current moment),” then the answer would depend on the time at which you evaluate. Under the natural reading here (event1 will/does occur following the initial event2), C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in later states).
- After event2, no other events can happen (i.e., if event2 occurs, it also prevents later events).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — a claim that event2 occurs immediately after the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — the conjunction that event2 happens in the next state (C1) and event1 happens (which is already true in the initial state).

4) How the conditions relate and final reasoning
- Because the initial state has event1 and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" applies, no event (including event2) can occur in any subsequent state. Therefore C1 is false (event2 cannot happen in the next state).
- C2 is the conjunction C1 AND event1. Even though event1 is true initially, C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happened (so event1 has occurred at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e., an occurrence of event1 at the immediate next time/state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — both event2 occurs in that next state and C1 is true.

4) How do these relate and conclusion?
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" makes all future events impossible, nothing can occur in the next state. So event1 does not ""happen"" in the next state (C1 is false) and event2 cannot happen either. Therefore the conjunction C2 (""event2 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Note on alternate readings: if one reads C1 as the persistent fact ""event1 has happened (is true) in the next state"" rather than ""occurs at the next step"", then C1 might be considered true, but event2 is still forbidden after event1, so C2 remains false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Since event1 has already occurred and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no event (including event2) can occur in the next state. Thus the conjunction ""event2 happens and C1 holds"" cannot be true. (Even under the alternate reading where C1 is taken as a persistent fact, event2 is still impossible, so C2 is false.)"

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened (so at the initial state event2 is true). No statement says event1 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (i.e., once event2 has occurred, the system permits no further event occurrences).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen later (i.e., event1 implies that event2 will occur subsequently).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — both events occur (in the state under consideration).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the state immediately following the current one, both event2 and event1 hold.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event2 already happened initially and ""after event2 no other events can happen"", event1 cannot occur after that initial event2. So there is no state (initial or any later one) in which both event2 and event1 are true.
- Therefore C1 is false in the initial state and remains false in the next state.
- Hence C2 (the claim that C1 holds in the next state) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: initially event2 has happened and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" prevents event1 from ever occurring. So C1 (""event2 and event1 both happen"") is false in every state, and thus C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This requires that both events occur (at least once).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is logically C1 ∧ event1. Since C1 already asserts event1 happens, C2 is equivalent to C1 (it doesn't add any new requirement).

4) How the conditions relate and truth value
- We start with event1 (given). By Rule B (after event1, event2 must happen), event2 must then happen. So both event1 and event2 occur. That satisfies C1.
- Since C2 is just C1 plus a redundant assertion that event1 happens, C2 is also satisfied.
- More concretely, you can get a sequence: event1 (initial) → event2 (by Rule B) → event1 (by Rule A) → event2 → … so both events do occur (indeed repeatedly).

Therefore C1 is True and C2 is True (C2 is equivalent to C1).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any continuation from the initial situation includes event1 next).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the run terminates after event1).

So the only possible finite run consistent with the rules is: event2 → event1, and then stop.

Step 3 — meanings of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual way for system properties, it means: in every possible execution/run that starts from the initial condition, event1 occurs (i.e., event1 inevitably happens at some point).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that the statement C1 is true in all runs / at all times — in other words, that the property C1 is a global fact of the system.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Given the initial event2 and the rule that after event2 event1 must happen, every allowed execution contains event1 (it occurs immediately after event2). Thus C1 is true.
- Since C1 is true for the system, the meta-statement C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

(If instead one reads C1 as claiming ""event1 holds at every time point"" then C1 would be false because initially only event2 has happened; under that reading C2 would also be false. The above conclusion uses the usual interpretation of ""always happens"" as inevitability across runs.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Interpreting C1 as ""in every possible execution/event sequence, event1 eventually occurs"" (the usual inevitability reading), the only allowed run is event2 → event1, so C1 holds. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"", i.e. C1 is true of the system) is true. 

(If instead C1 were read as ""event1 holds at every time point,"" both C1 and C2 would be false; but under the standard interpretation used above, C2 is True.)"

Short answer: C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (That prevents any further event after the initial event1.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (This asserts that in the immediate next state after the initial one, event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (C2 is the conjunction: event1 happens next AND event2 happens somewhere as required by the statement.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and evaluation of C2?
- Because the initial state already had event1 and Rule A says no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. Thus the conjunct ""event2 happens"" in C2 is impossible to satisfy after the given initial event1.
- Therefore C2 is false.

(Note: whether C1 itself is true depends on how you read Rule A. If ""no other events can happen"" means ""no events at all after event1,"" then C1 is false. If it means ""no events other than event1 may happen,"" then C1 could be true. Either way, C2 requires event2 as well, and event2 is impossible after the initial event1, so C2 is false.)

Step-by-step:

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time/state 0, event1 happened (event1 is true at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — meaning: whenever event1 holds at some state t, event2 must hold at the next state t+1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — meaning: whenever event2 holds at state t, event1 must hold at t+1.
Together these force an alternation (assuming ""after"" means the immediate next state): state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ...

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to simply ""event1 holds in the current state"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Concretely: ""event1 holds at the next state.""

4) How they relate and truth value of C2
- At the initial state (state0) C1 is true because event1 holds.
- At the next state (state1), by the transition rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 holds. Under the forced alternation, event1 does not hold at state1.
- Therefore C1 is false at state1, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

(If you intended a different semantics of ""after"" — e.g., ""eventually after"" rather than the immediate next state, or if states can contain both events simultaneously — the result could change; under the standard immediate-next-state reading above, C2 is false.)

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual reading of ""always"").

Step‑by‑step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so each event2 is followed later by an event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so each event1 is followed later by an event2).
Together these force an alternation: starting from event1 at t0, event2 must occur next, then event1, then event2, … (t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, …).

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" The usual precise reading is global/always: at every time point event2 holds (G event2). (If instead one meant “event2 happens eventually” or “happens infinitely often,” that’s a different formula.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" That is: (event2 occurs at some point) ∧ (event2 holds always).

4) How do they relate and are they true?
- From the timeline t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, … we see event2 does occur (at t1 and repeatedly). So the claim “event2 happens (at some times)” is true.
- But C1 as G(event2) is false because at t0 event2 did not hold (event1 did). So C1 is false.
- C2 is a conjunction of a true part (“event2 happens”) and a false part (C1), so C2 is false.

Note on alternate readings: If you interpret C1 as “event2 happens infinitely often” (GF(event2)), then C1 would be true and C2 (which requires both ""event2 happens"" and that same C1) would be true. But under the standard natural reading of “always” = “at all times,” C1 is false and therefore C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already occurred.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., from the state where event1 has occurred, event2 is guaranteed to occur eventually).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — a claim that at some point in the future (possibly immediately) event2 will occur.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — the conjunction that event2 does occur and moreover the statement C1 (that event2 eventually happens) is true. (Note: if event2 happens, C1 is automatically satisfied, so the second conjunct is redundant.)

4) How they relate / conclusion
- From the premises: event1 has occurred initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen."" Therefore event2 will indeed occur (so C1 is true).
- Since event2 occurs, the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true; combined with C1 being true, the conjunction C2 is true in every possible trace consistent with the premises.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward (event2 → event1).
- Rule B: If event1 occurs, no other events can occur afterward (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" (i.e., at least one of event1 or event2 occurs at some point in the timeline.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., neither event1 nor event2 happens.)

- Therefore C2 (which asserts that C1 is false) is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (i.e. event2 has occurred at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs then event2 will occur afterward.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal — once it has happened, no further events can occur.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical implication with the same antecedent and consequent (event2 → event2). That is a tautology — always true (it holds regardless of whether event2 actually occurs).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 is true exactly when event1 happens.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final determination
- Because event2 happened initially and rule B says no other events can happen after event2, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur afterward. There is also no information that event1 occurred before the initial state. So we have no basis to assert that event1 happens.
- Therefore C1 is true, but event1 does not occur, so C2 is false.

Final answer: C1 is True; C2 is False. (Assuming the ordinary reading of “after” as strictly later and no other hidden events.)

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the starting point).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 occurs, then afterward event2 must occur.
- If event2 occurs, no other events can occur afterward (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to just ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means ""event1 will hold at some point from now on"" (i.e., event1 will happen eventually after the initial state).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal (no events can occur after it), there is no possibility for event1 to occur at or after the initial state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold now and cannot become true in the future, so C2 is false (not satisfied) under the given assumptions.

(If one allowed events before the initial point or interpreted ""eventually"" to include the past, other readings might be possible, but under the usual forward-in-time interpretation from the given initial state, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 is ""event1 happens"". Since event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal (no events can occur afterward), event1 cannot occur now or in the future, so ""event1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: event2 has happened at the initial state. (No statement that event1 has happened at any point.)

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 happens, event2 must happen (event1 implies that at some later point event2 occurs).
- Rule B: After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreting this as a global implication about occurrence: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must also occur (either earlier, simultaneously, or later). More concretely, at any state where event2 is true, the implication event2 -> event1 is true iff event1 is also true at that state (or has happened in the relevant temporal semantics).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means at some future state (possibly now) the condition C1 becomes true.

Step 4 — how they relate and the truth of C2
- At the initial state event2 is true. For the implication event2 -> event1 (C1) to be true at that state, event1 must also be true there (or have occurred in whatever temporal sense the implication requires). No information is given that event1 has occurred prior to the initial state, so we must assume event1 is not true now.
- Because event2 has occurred and rule B says no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur later either.
- Therefore C1 is false now (true antecedent, false consequent) and cannot become true at any future state.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

(If instead one were told that event1 had already occurred before event2, then C1 would hold and C2 would be true. But with only the given facts — initially event2 and no events after event2 — C2 is false.)

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happens (call this state s0 where event2 holds).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next. (If a state has event1, the immediately following state has event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen next. (If a state has event2, the immediately following state has event1.)
- Thus the system alternates: ... → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Temporal: X event2.)
  - This is a property of a particular state: it says the immediate successor is event2.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (Temporal: G (X event2).)
  - This says: in every state, the next state satisfies event2.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Start from s0 where event2 holds. By the rule, the next state s1 must have event1, so at s0 the statement ""next is event2"" (C1 at s0) is false.
- C1 is true in states that currently have event1 (because their successor is event2), and false in states that currently have event2 (because their successor is event1).
- Since C1 fails at s0 (and at every state with event2), C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (counterexample: the initial state where event2 holds, its next state is event1, so C1 fails there).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (so at the initial time point event2 occurs).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => whenever event1 occurs, it is terminal (nothing happens at later times).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => whenever event2 occurs, it is also terminal.
Because event2 happens initially, no events can occur after that initial moment.

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; it is equivalent to the single claim ""event1 happens"" (i.e. there is a time point at which event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" in the usual temporal sense (true at every time point), C2 claims that at every time point C1 is true — in other words, event1 would have to be true at every time point.

4) How the conditions relate and truth values:
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not occur at any later time. Under the standard reading there is no time at which event1 happens, so C1 is false.
- If C1 is false (event1 does not occur), then ""C1 always holds"" is also false. Even if one allowed simultaneous occurrence at the initial instant (both event1 and event2 at time 0), C2 would still fail under the usual reading of ""always"" because event1 would not hold at all later times.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because event2 occurs initially and both events are terminal, event1 never occurs (so C1 is false), hence ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (initial state contains event2). event1 has not been stated as having happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Formally: event2 ⇒ eventually event1.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: once it occurs, there are no further events.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (i.e., at some point in the future event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event1 does not eventually happen; the negation of C1.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial condition (event2 happened) together with the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", it follows that event1 will occur at some point. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so since C1 is true, C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
So the system forces alternation: starting from the initial event2 you get the sequence 2,1,2,1,2,1,...

3) Meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted in the usual temporal/logical sense as: at every moment (from now on) event1 holds (formally: G event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. there is some future point after which C1 holds forever (formally: F G event1). In words: eventually we reach a time after which event1 holds at every step.

(If instead you meant ""always happens"" to mean ""happens infinitely often,"" that is a different property; I use the standard reading above.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Under the alternation 2,1,2,1,... event1 occurs repeatedly but not at every moment: every other step is event2. So C1 (G event1) is false.
- C2 requires that at some point event1 holds at every subsequent moment. That never happens because event2 keeps occurring forever. Therefore C2 (F G event1) is false.

Additional note: although C1 and C2 are false, the property ""event1 happens infinitely often"" (G F event1) is true in this system.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Starting from event2 the system forces the infinite alternation 2,1,2,1,... so there is never a point after which event1 holds at every subsequent step. Hence F G event1 (C2) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward.
These rules create an alternating requirement: once event1 has happened, event2 must follow, and once event2 has happened, event1 must follow, etc.

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (This asserts that event1 never happens or at least that event1 is false.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (A conjunction: C1 ∧ event2.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- C1 contradicts the initial condition (the problem states event1 happened initially). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to be true and event2 to happen. Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false regardless of whether event2 happens.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- Rule B: After event2 happens, no other events can happen (the system stops/halts).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There exists some point in the timeline at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (Equivalent to: event2 does not eventually happen.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because the initial condition states event2 has already happened, C1 is satisfied: event2 does occur (at the initial moment).
- Therefore C2, which claims that C1 does not hold, is false.

Note on temporal interpretation: If by ""eventually"" you meant strictly at some time after the initial moment (excluding the initial occurrence), then you would ask whether a later event2 occurs. Given the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" no further events (including another event2) can occur, so under that stricter interpretation C1 would be false and C2 true. In standard usage, though, ""eventually happens"" is satisfied by an occurrence at or after the initial time, so C1 true and C2 false.

False

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Combining these: since event2 has happened initially, event1 must happen afterwards; once event1 occurs nothing else can happen. So the actual sequence is event2 then event1, and both occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" This asserts both events occur.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Logically C2 = (event1) ∨ (event1 ∧ event2). Note (event1 ∧ event2) implies event1, so C2 is logically equivalent to just ""event1 happens.""

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- From the rules we deduced event1 does happen (because it must follow event2). Therefore C1 is true (both events happen).
- Since event1 is true, the disjunction in C2 is true. (Also C1 true makes C2 true.)

- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs, then event1 will occur afterward).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the implication (event2 happens) ⇒ (event1 happens).

4) How they relate
- Since event2 does happen (C1 true) and the rules force event1 to happen after event2, event1 does happen. Therefore the implication in C2 holds (non‑vacuously in this case). (As a side note: even if C1 were false, the implication would be vacuously true, but here C1 is actually true.)

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is true (event2 happens), and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ensures event1 occurs, so the implication (if C1 then event1) holds."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the start state event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1 is terminal)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (event2 is terminal)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., event1 never occurs in the scenario)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., C2 asserts that event1 does happen)

4) How they relate and final logical conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal (no other events can happen after it), event1 cannot occur after that initial event2. There is no earlier time for event1 to have happened (the scenario starts with event2). Thus event1 does not happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 asserts the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

Note on ambiguity: If you allowed simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment (both event1 and event2 happening exactly together), you could get a different result. Under the usual reading (events are sequential and initial means no prior events), C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 has already happened and is terminal, so event1 cannot occur (C1 is true). C2 asserts the negation of C1, so C2 is false."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at least at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1).
Together these produce a cycle: event1 triggers event2, which triggers event1, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (¬E1).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. E1 → C1. Substituting C1, C2 is E1 → ¬E1.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what is the truth value of C2?
- Logically E1 → ¬E1 is equivalent to ¬E1 (because p→¬p ≡ ¬p). So C2 is equivalent to C1.
- Given the initial condition that event1 happened (E1 is true), C1 (¬E1) is false.
- Since the antecedent of C2 (E1) is true and the consequent (¬E1) is false, the implication E1 → ¬E1 is false. So C2 is false.

Note: If instead event1 never happened, C2 would be vacuously true; but with the stated initial event1, C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 must occur later).

(I'm reading ""must happen"" as ""must happen eventually"" after event2.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" In the given scenario this is already satisfied because event2 happened initially → C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when event2 occurs (C1) and event1 also occurs sometime.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true?
- Given Rule B and the fact event2 occurred, event1 is required to occur later. So event1 will happen in any allowed execution that starts with event2.
- Therefore C1 is true and event1 happens, so C2 is true.

(There is no conflict with Rule A: event1 being terminal only means nothing happens after event1; that does not prevent event1 from occurring after event2.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the initial time (call it t0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” Interpreted as: whenever event1 occurs at some time t, event2 will occur at the next relevant time (or at some guaranteed later time).
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” Likewise, whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur next (or at some guaranteed later time).
- Together with the initial event1 at t0, the natural timeline is an alternation:
  t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … (event1 occurs at every other step).

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” This is ambiguous:
  - Strict/global reading (G): event1 holds at every time point.
  - Liveness/recurrence reading (GF): event1 happens infinitely often (from any point there will be a future event1).
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” This is the conjunction C1 ∧ (event1 occurs now/at the evaluation time).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth-value of C2
- Under the usual strict reading of “always” = “at every time point”:
  - C1 is false, because event1 does not occur at the times when event2 occurs.
  - Therefore C2 (C1 ∧ event1) is false.
- Under the weaker reading “always” meaning “always eventually” / “infinitely often”:
  - C1 is true (event1 recurs at t0, t2, t4, …).
  - Whether C2 is true depends on the time of evaluation: at t0 (initial time) event1 does happen, so C2 is true there (C1 true and event1 holds at t0). At times when event2 holds (t1, t3, …) event1 does not hold now, so C2 is false at those times even though C1 remains true.
  
Summary answer
- If “always” means “at every time”: C1 is false and C2 is false.
- If “always” means “occurs infinitely often / always eventually”: C1 is true; C2 is true at times when event1 is currently happening (e.g. initially at t0) and false at times when event2 is happening.  

If you tell me which formal semantics you intend for “always” and whether C2 should be evaluated at the initial time or at an arbitrary time, I can give the single definitive truth value.

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start (there is an occurrence of event1 initially).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once the initial event1 has occurred the system has no further events — the trace terminates after that occurrence.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That says any occurrence of event2 would be followed by an occurrence of event1. (But in the given trace event2 never actually occurs, because event1 already occurred and prevents any further events.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Read naturally as a temporal implication: any occurrence of event1 is (eventually) followed by an occurrence of event2. Equivalently, on the trace, whenever event1 occurs there must be some later event2.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Read as: at some point in the future the property C1 will be true (or equivalently C1 will hold from that point onward).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- In the actual trace we have an initial event1 and then no further events. Therefore there is an occurrence of event1 that is not followed by any event2. That makes C1 false on this trace: the implication ""event1 ⇒ event2 (later)"" is violated by the initial event1.
- Because no future events occur after the initial state, there is no later time at which C1 can become true. Hence C1 does not “eventually hold.”
- Therefore C2 is False.

(If you instead intended a different formal reading of C1 — for example a propositional, same-instant material implication — the same counterexample applies: at the initial instant event1 is true and event2 is false, so the material implication is false, and C1 does not hold.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The trace has event1 at the start and then no further events. That single occurrence of event1 is not followed by any event2, so C1 (""every event1 is followed by an event2"") is false on the trace. Since nothing later can make C1 true, C1 never eventually holds, so C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual temporal-logic reading of C1).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur sometime afterward.
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no further events occur (the system becomes terminal).

A possible timeline consistent with these rules: time 0: event1; time 1: event2; time 2+: no events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" In temporal logic this is usually F(event1) — there exists a (current or future) point where event1 occurs. Given the initial condition, C1 is true at the initial time because event1 already happened.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This is usually read as G(C1), i.e. at every point in time it is true that event1 will occur at some (current-or-future) time. (If you meant something different — e.g. ""event1 has happened at some time in the past or present"" — say so; that changes the answer.)

4) How do these conditions relate and conclusion?
- Evaluate C1 at different times in the example timeline:
  - At time 0 (initial): F(event1) is true because event1 has happened.
  - At time 1 (after event1 and after event2): there is no future event1 (rule B), so F(event1) is false at time 1.
- Because C1 is false at some future times, G(C1) (C2) is false.

Therefore, under the standard interpretation of C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" and C2 = ""always (event1 eventually happens)"", C2 is false. If you intended C1 to mean ""event1 has occurred at some time up to now"" (a past/persistent property), then C2 would be true; clarify the intended temporal operator if you want that case analyzed.

- No other rules or events are given.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Read naturally as: in any execution, whenever event2 occurs, event1 has occurred (earlier or at some point) in that execution.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That means C1 is true in every possible execution/state — there is no reachable execution where C1 is false.

4) How they relate (proof that C2 is True)
- By the initial condition, event1 has happened in every execution.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" means that whenever event2 occurs it does so only in an execution that already had event1 (indeed event1 occurred at the start).
- Therefore in every execution where event2 happens, event1 has happened earlier; C1 is true in every execution.
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Remark: This assumes the usual temporal reading of ""happens"" as occurrence in the same execution (past or present). If you instead meant C1 to require event1 and event2 to occur simultaneously, the answer could differ; under the natural interpretation above, C2 is True.
