Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The context gives an initial event2 and the rules:
  - After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → next event is event2).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → next event is event1).
- Starting from the initial event2, the rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") would mean event2 holds at every time point. That is false in the alternating sequence because event1 occurs at every other step, so event2 does not hold at those times.
- C2 says: if event1 happens, then C1 holds. But we have runs where event1 does happen (indeed repeatedly) and yet C1 is false in those runs. Thus the implication in C2 is not satisfied.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules we get an infinite alternation starting with event2: event2 (initially) → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") would mean event2 is true at every moment; that is false because at moments when event1 occurs, event2 does not occur.
- Since event1 does occur in the enforced alternation but C1 is false, the implication in C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is false (true antecedent, false consequent).
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the claim: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 is: ""Event2 always happens.""
So we must check whether, under the given conditions, whenever event1 occurs the statement ""event2 always happens"" is true.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event1, an event2 must happen (i.e., every event1 is followed by an event2).
- After any event2, an event1 must happen (i.e., every event2 is followed by an event1).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Start: event2 (given).
- After that event2, an event1 must happen.
- After that event1, an event2 must happen.
- After that event2, an event1 must happen, and so on.
So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: ..., event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- In this alternating sequence event2 occurs repeatedly (in fact infinitely often). Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" (interpreting as event2 continues to occur in the run) holds.
- Because event1 does occur in the run and whenever event1 occurs it is followed (and thereafter alternates) with event2, the implication ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is satisfied.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every point in the execution, event2 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so C1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the execution halts at/after event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C2
- At the initial point C1 is true because event2 has already occurred.
- Consider the state after event2: no further events can occur, and event2 will not occur again in the future. Thus at that state ""event2 eventually happens"" is false (there is no future occurrence).
- Because C1 does not hold at every state (it fails at the post-event2 state), C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
First, identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens (i.e., on a given run/trace there is some point where event2 occurs).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in all possible runs/traces, event2 eventually happens).

Examine the conditions from the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. That fixes the initial state: event2 has already occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would be terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Trace reasoning:
- Because event2 happened initially, every execution (starting state) already contains event2 at the very beginning. So C1 is true on the actual initial run.
- There are no alternate initial choices given (the context states event2 happened initially), so there is no run that lacks event2.
- The ""after event2, no other events can happen"" condition only prevents further events; it does not prevent event2 from having occurred. Thus no counterexample trace can be produced where event2 never happens.

Conclusion:
- In every possible run consistent with the context, event2 occurs (at the initial point), so C1 holds in all runs. Therefore C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every reachable point, it remains true that event2 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so C1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the system reaches a terminal situation where no future occurrence of any event is possible).
- Also after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 does not occur in the given initial scenario.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At time 0: event2 occurs → C1 is true at time 0.
- At any later time after time 0: no further events can happen, so there is no future occurrence of event2. From those later states, ""event2 eventually happens"" is false (the occurrence is in the past, not in the future).

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires C1 to hold at every point. C1 holds at the initial point but fails at later points (because no future event2 can occur). Therefore C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately following the initial one).

Step 2 — Examine the context statements:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 ever occurs, event2 must follow.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal; no events occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — Reason about possible event sequences:
- Since event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no future events (including event1) can occur at any time.
- Therefore the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is true in the initial state and at all subsequent states (there are no events after the initial event2).

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 claims C1 holds in the next state. Because no events can occur after event2, in the next state event1 does not happen, so C1 holds there.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.
- C1 is ""Event1 does not happen."" So C2 says ""In the next state, Event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 has already happened (we start after event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in all subsequent states no events can occur).
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after event2.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- Since we are already after event2 and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true in the next state.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, Event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant unless event1 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, there can be no events (including event1) in any subsequent state.
- Therefore event1 does not happen now (C1 is true initially) and also does not happen in the next state.

Sample responses:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. ""Eventually (Event1 eventually happens).""

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 has already happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from the initial state there will be some future time when event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 occurs, event2 will later occur again, and the alternation can continue).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event2 has already happened and “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 will indeed occur at some future time. That makes C1 true from the initial point.
- If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" is also true (it already holds now). Also note the temporal identity F F P = F P, so ""eventually (eventually P)"" is equivalent to ""eventually P.""

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens."" C2 is ""Eventually, C1 holds"" — i.e. eventually (event1 eventually happens).
- From the context: initially event2 occurred, and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ensures that event1 will occur at some later time. Therefore C1 is true now.
- If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" is also true (eventually includes the present, and in temporal logic F F p ≡ F p).
- Hence C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — clarify hypotheses:
- At time 0, event2 has occurred.
- Rule A: After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- Rule B: After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- From the initial fact (event2 at time 0) and Rule B, event1 must occur at some future time. So C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. ""eventually (event1 eventually happens).""
- Since C1 already holds now (we showed event1 will eventually occur from the initial state), it is certainly true that at some time (in fact immediately) C1 holds. Also in temporal logic eventually(eventually P) ≡ eventually P, so C2 is equivalent to C1 and therefore true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 is the claim ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" You are asked whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P). It is true regardless of the event system or the context. So C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds OR event2 happens."" Since C1 holds (true), the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.

(As a side note: the context also implies event2 will occur after the initial event1, so the second disjunct is true as well — but that is unnecessary once C1 is established.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether the statement C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a material implication p → p, which is a tautology (always true).  
- Concretely, the context says event1 did happen initially, so the antecedent and consequent are both true at that time; the implication is true there as well.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true (tautologically and in the given context), the disjunction C1 ∨ event2 is true regardless of whether event2 occurs.

Conclusion
- True
---
First, restate the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event1 happens. (This is the formula event1 → event1.)
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens. (C2 = C1 ∨ event2.)

Examine C1:
- The implication event1 → event1 is a logical tautology (it is always true).

Therefore C1 is true. A disjunction with a true disjunct is true, so C2 is true regardless of whether event2 occurs.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 does happen, at least at the start.)
- After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2, event1 must happen. That enforces an alternation: starting from the initial event1, event2 will occur next, then event1, then event2, etc.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- Because event1 already happened initially, the disjunction ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" is immediately satisfied (the left disjunct is true).
- Therefore C2 is true (independent of whether C1 is considered).

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- We must evaluate C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true (at least at the start).
- The other rules (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1) imply further occurrences but are not needed to evaluate the disjunction.

Step 3 — apply logic:
- A disjunction A or B is true if at least one of A or B is true.
- Since ""Event1 happens"" is true (given initially), the disjunction C2 is true regardless of C1.

Final answer:
True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" (equivalent to ""event2 happens"".)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (equivalent to ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"".)

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterward.)
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.)

Step 3 — examine C1:
- Because event1 happened initially and that prevents any further events, event2 does not happen. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — examine C2:
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event2"". Since C1 is false in this context, the implication is true (a conditional with a false antecedent is true). Also logically C2 is tautological (event2 -> event2).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" which is logically equivalent to just ""Event2 happens"" (P ∧ P ≡ P).
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"", i.e. C1 → event2.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — so once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in this scenario, so C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C1 is equivalent to ""event2"", so C2 is ""event2 → event2"", which is a tautology (always true).
- Alternatively, since C1 is false in the given context, the implication C1 → event2 is vacuously true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen.
- (The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never happens given event1 already occurred.)

Step 3 — analyze C1:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- Given event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 does not happen. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""If C1 then event2"". Since C1 is equivalent to event2, C2 is logically ""if event2 then event2"", which is trivially true. Also, an implication with a false antecedent (C1 is false) is true.

Sample responses:
First, identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, event2 does not happen)

Now examine the given rules:
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state s0, event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (interpreted as: if event2 holds in a state, then in the next state event1 holds).
- After event1, event2 must happen (interpreted as: if event1 holds in a state, then in the next state event2 holds).

Trace the sequence step by step:
- s0: event2 holds (given).
- From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we get s1: event1 holds.
- Given these rules are specifying the required next-event, s1 will have event1 and not event2 (events are taken to alternate per the rules).
- Hence in s1, ""event2 does not happen"" (C1) is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true.

(If one allowed events to co-occur in the same state, the conclusion could be different, but under the usual sequential interpretation that these rules force alternation, C2 is True.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (a proposition about a state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state, event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially (in the initial state S0) event2 happened.
- Rule 1: after event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state S1, event1 holds).
- Rule 2: after event1, event2 must happen (so in the state after S1, event2 will hold again).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- S0: event2 occurred.
- S1 (the next state): by Rule 1, event1 occurs. Therefore event2 does not occur in S1.
- S2: by Rule 2, event2 occurs again (irrelevant to C2, which refers only to S1).

Conclusion:
- In the next state S1, event2 does not happen, so C1 holds in the next state. Therefore C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just redundant; C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e. ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"".

Step 2 — what the context says:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen — so event1 does occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen — event1 is terminal.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- Because event1 does happen, C1 is true.
- C2 is the implication (event1 → event1), which is always true when evaluated (and here the antecedent and consequent are both true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is ""event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is equivalent to just ""event1 happens"" (A ∧ A ≡ A).

Step 3 — use the context:
- Context says event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen, so event1 does indeed happen. Therefore C1 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is (C1 → event1). Since C1 is equivalent to event1, C1 → event1 is logically true (and in this context the antecedent holds and the consequent holds). So C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- Context yields the sequence: event2 happened initially → event1 must happen after event2 → after event1 no further events. So event1 does happen.
- C1 is ""event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"". Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2 is the conditional ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""

Step 3 — Reason about the conditional
- Since C1 is true and its consequent (event1 happens) is also true, the implication C1 → event1 is true.
- More generally, ""A and A implies A"" is logically valid, so C2 is true whenever C1 is true (and in fact as a logical form).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the future C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened → C1 is true right now.
- After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 no further events can occur. (So the run is: event1 at time 0, then event2, then terminal.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asks whether there exists a time (now or later) at which C1 holds.
- Since C1 already holds initially (event1 has happened), there is such a time (the initial time). Therefore C2 is true.

(If one used a nonstandard “eventually” meaning strictly later than the current moment, C2 could be false because C1 may not hold at any strictly later time; but under the standard interpretation where ""eventually"" includes the present, C2 is true.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" So C2 is ""eventually(C1)"" i.e. F(F(event1)).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 already happened. That means C1 is already true at the initial time.
- After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 no further events occur — this doesn't prevent C1 from being true (it already is).

Step 3 — reason about C2
- C2 requires that there exists some time at which C1 holds. C1 holds right now (initially), so such a time exists.
- (Also note the temporal identity F F p ≡ F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1.)

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. eventually (C1).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial time, event1 has already occurred.
- After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 no other events occur. So a possible timeline is: event1 (now) → event2 → end.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- At the initial time, event1 has already happened, so the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true (the ""eventually"" modality includes the present moment in standard temporal semantics).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 says ""eventually C1"". Since C1 is already true at the initial time, there exists a time (the initial time) at which C1 holds, so ""eventually C1"" is true.
- (Also note the temporal equivalence F(F p) ≡ F p, so nesting eventualities doesn't change truth.)

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state C1 is true).

- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has occurred already).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events).
- The statement about event2 is irrelevant because event2 did not occur.

Step 3 — consequence for C1:
- Since after event1 no events can happen, the immediate next state cannot contain any event occurrences. Therefore event1 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false in the initial situation.

Step 4 — consequence for C2:
- C2 requires C1 to hold always. Because C1 is false in the next state, C2 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — Evaluate C1:

- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens). Logically, C2 is equivalent to (event1 OR event2) (since C1 already is event1 OR event2).

- After event2, no other events can happen. (Since event2 already happened initially, no further events can occur afterward.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event2 did happen initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 already holds, so C2 is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

- After event1, event2 must happen (a constraint, not needed here).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event1 cannot occur after that initial event2).

- Since event2 did happen initially, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = C1 ∨ event1. But C1 is already true, so C2 is true (and equivalently C2 simplifies to event1 ∨ event2, which is true because event2 occurred).

- After event1, event2 must happen (so from the initial event1, event2 must occur at some later time).
- After event2, event1 must happen (gives a mutual liveness but does not prevent event2).

Step 3 — trace reasoning:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" applies, event2 is required to occur at some future point.
- Therefore event2 will eventually hold, satisfying C1 and thus C2.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (the conjuncts are the same).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""event2 eventually happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so some time after the initial event1 there must be an event2).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (this only adds further alternation but does not prevent the first event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0: event1 has occurred (given).
- By Rule A, there must be a later time at which event2 occurs. Thus event2 does occur at least once.
- After that, Rule B forces event1 again, then Rule A forces another event2, etc. But regardless of the infinite alternation, an event2 does occur.

Conclusion
- Since event2 does occur after the initial event1, C1 will hold, so C2 (""event2 eventually happens"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" requires that at some later time event2 occurs (after the initial event1).
- Therefore event2 does eventually happen, so C1 (""event2 happens"") becomes true at that later time.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must evaluate whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will happen sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Since event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen subsequently.
- Thus both event2 and event1 occur (in that order), and then nothing further happens.

Step 4 — evaluate the formulas
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens"". Given both events occur, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"". Logically this is equivalent to ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" (since C1 is event1 ∨ event2), so C2 is also true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 is true.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 will happen sometime after event2.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal; but it still happens.)

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event2 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is true, so the disjunction C2 is true (no need to rely on event1).

Final answer:
True
---
First, identify what is asked:
- We must determine whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true (at the initial point).
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will happen sometime after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant to truth of C2 except that event1 is terminal).

Evaluate C1:
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens"".
- Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true (the disjunction is satisfied by event2).

Evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"".
- We already have C1 true, so the disjunction C1 ∨ event1 is true regardless of whether event1 has occurred yet.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened"", so C1 is true in the scenario.

Step 3 — examine C2
- C2 is the implication (event1 -> C1).
- Since C1 is equivalent to event1, the implication (p -> p) is always true (and in this scenario event1 does occur and C1 holds).
- Therefore C2 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must evaluate whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"", i.e. ""event1 -> C1"".

Step 3 — trace the events from the context
- The context states that initially event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true in the given scenario.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 happens"") is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The implication ""if event1 happens then C1"" has a true antecedent and a true consequent, so it is true.
- More generally, since C1 is equivalent to the antecedent, the implication is tautologically true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to just ""Event1 happens"" (p ∨ p ≡ p).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is the implication p → C1. Substituting C1 ≡ p gives p → p.

Step 3 — reason about the logic and the context
- Logically, p → p is a tautology (always true).
- In the given context, event1 does happen, so C1 is true and the implication p → p is true as well.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the proposition ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (event2 ∨ event1).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future time at which event2 ∨ event1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (so at the current/initial time event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from any time event2 occurs, there will be a later time with event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from any time event1 occurs, there will be a later time with event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0 event2 holds, so C1 (event2 ∨ event1) already holds immediately.
- Also the obligations force an alternating sequence: event2 (time 0) → eventually event1 → eventually event2 → ... So events occur repeatedly, so C1 will hold at those event times.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 holds right now (and will hold repeatedly later), ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (event2 ∨ event1).
- C2 is ""eventually C1 holds"" (at some time in the future, C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next.
- After any event1, event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At the initial moment event2 is true, so C1 is already true immediately.
- If “eventually” includes the current moment, C2 holds because C1 holds now.
- If “eventually” means strictly later, then because event2 was just true, event1 must occur next, so C1 will be true at the next moment. Thus C2 still holds.
- In fact the obligations force an alternating sequence event2, event1, event2, … so C1 holds at every step.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e., at some point an occurrence of event2 or event1 holds).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point either event2 or event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so at the initial moment event2 holds).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
These rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — trace the sequence and check C1 and C2:
- Because event2 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the initial moment (event2 holds).
- Therefore ""eventually C1 holds"" is true (it holds immediately and will continue to hold at the times those events occur).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. (event2 → event1 does not happen). We must decide whether this implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is a fact (it did happen).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- The other sentence (""After event2, no other events can happen"") is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and it prevents any subsequent events, event2 cannot happen in the actual scenario described.

Step 4 — evaluate the implication
- The antecedent of C2 (""event2 happens"") is impossible under the context (it cannot happen).
- In classical logic an implication with a false (impossible) antecedent is vacuously true. Therefore, (event2 → event1 does not happen) is true given the context — even though the consequent (C1) is false in actuality, the implication holds because event2 cannot occur.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" which is the conditional (event2 → (event1 does not happen)).

Step 2 — the facts from the context
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened, event2 cannot occur afterward.
- Because event1 happened initially, there is no earlier time for event2 to have occurred. So, under the context, event2 does not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditional
- In all models consistent with the context, event2 is false. A material implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Therefore (event2 → not event1) is true given the context.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (C1 = ""Event1 does not happen."")
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — what the context gives us
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" → event1 did happen.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time (event1 happened first and forbids further events).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false, because event1 did happen.
- C2 is the conditional ""If event2 happens, then event1 does not happen.""
  - The antecedent ""event2 happens"" is false in this context (event2 cannot happen).
  - In standard (material) logic, a conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).

True.

Reason: Initially event2 has already occurred, so the left disjunct of C2 (""Event2 happens"") is true. Therefore the disjunction C2 is true regardless of C1 (and indeed C1 is false because no events can occur after event2).
---
Step 1 — what we know about times
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true at the initial state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So no event (including event2 again) can occur in any state after the initial one.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Irrelevant here because event1 never happens in the given scenario.

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Because no events can occur after event2, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" The left disjunct ""Event2 happens"" is true at the initial state (given). An OR is true if at least one disjunct is true, so C2 is true regardless of C1.

Final answer: True
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""Event2 happens"" is true (it already occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen, so C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is false (no events, including event2, can occur in the next state).
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 did not occur.

- Since event2 has already happened initially, the disjunction in C2 is satisfied by the first disjunct.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 says: ""In the next state, C1 holds."" C1 is ""event1 always happens"" (i.e. event1 holds at all future states).
2. From the context: event1 happens initially, and ""after event1 no other events can happen."" That makes the initial occurrence of event1 terminal: there are no allowed further events or transitions that would produce future occurrences.
3. Therefore there is no basis to conclude that event1 will hold at every future state (C1). In standard temporal semantics, a Next formula evaluated when there is no next state is not satisfied; and even if a next state existed with no events, nothing in the rules forces event1 to hold forever.
4. Hence ""C1 holds in the next state"" (C2) is not guaranteed and is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every future point).
- The context says initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred (as it has initially), there can be no further events — in particular, event1 cannot occur again at later times.
- Therefore event1 does not hold at every future point, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; because C1 is false (event1 does not always happen in future states), C2 is also false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., it holds globally). C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state.

- From the context: initially event1 happened. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means the system terminates after that event — there is no successor state in which new events occur. The rule about event2 is irrelevant because event2 can never occur after event1.

- Because there is no next state reachable after the initial state, C1 cannot be said to hold ""in the next state"" (there is no next state to evaluate it in). Therefore C2 is not satisfied.

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: event2 happens and event1 happens.
- From the context: event2 did happen (initially). Also, ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" so no events (including event1) can occur after event2.
- If event1 had happened before event2, then ""after event1, no other events can happen"" would prevent event2 from happening afterward — but event2 did happen. So event1 could not have happened before event2 either.
- Therefore event1 did not happen at any time, so C1 is false; hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold.""
- C1 asserts ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
So we must decide whether it is possible for both event2 and event1 to have happened given the context; if not, C2 is True.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has happened, no further events can occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So likewise, once event1 happens, no other events can occur afterward.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- If event1 happened before event2, then after event1 no other events could happen, so event2 could not have happened later — contradicts ""initially, event2 happened.""
- If event1 happened after event2, that is prohibited by ""after event2, no other events can happen.""
- The only remaining possibility would be that they occurred simultaneously, but the context treats events as preventing any other events after they occur; given the statements and the usual sequential reading, simultaneous occurrence is not supported and would still conflict with the ""after"" constraints.

Therefore it is impossible for both event2 and event1 to have happened.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1 asserts: ""event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not(both event2 and event1 happen)).

Step 2 — examine the premises:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant once we know event1 didn't happen).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Since event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur after event2.
- There is no indication event1 occurred before event2 (and ""initially"" marks the start), so event1 did not happen.

Step 4 — conclude:
- C1 is false (event1 did not happen), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — clarify meanings/assumptions:
- ""EventX happened"" means X occurs in that state (not a persistent truth across all future states).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means in every immediate successor state after the state where event2 occurs, no events occur (so neither event1 nor event2 occurs there).

Step 2 — identify states:
- Initial state S0: event2 happened (given).
- Next state S1 (the state after S0): by the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"", no events occur in S1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens"". C1 is true in S0 (because event2 happened there).
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e., C1 must be true in S1. But in S1 no events occur, so neither event1 nor event2 happens there, so C1 is false in S1.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

False

Step 1 — what is asked:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so C1 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Thus there is no transition to a state in which a new event occurs.)
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here since event1 did not occur initially).

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- C2 requires that in the successor (next) state, either event1 or event2 happens.
- But since after event2 no other events can happen, there is no successor state in which an event occurs (no next state that makes event1 or event2 true).
- Under the standard interpretation where ""next"" requires an actual successor state, C1 cannot hold in a non-existent next state.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, either event1 or event2 happens.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state C1 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means once event2 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences in any subsequent state.
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen — same kind of restriction if event1 had happened.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0 (initial state): event2 happened → C1 is true at time 0.
- Because event2 has happened, no events can occur after time 0.
- Therefore at time 1 (the next state) neither event1 nor event2 happens.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that in the next state either event1 or event2 happens. But we just concluded no events happen in the next state, so C1 is false there.
- Thus C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially (time 0) event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to happen at the next state (time 1).
- At time 1 event2 happens, so event1 does not happen at time 1 (events are taken as single occurrences per state).
- C1 is ""event1 does not happen""; hence C1 holds at time 1.
- C2 states that C1 holds in the next state — therefore C2 is True.
---
First identify the question: is C2 true — i.e. does ""Event1 does not happen"" hold in the next state?

Given conditions:
- Initially event1 happened (so current state: event1 true).
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.

From the initial state (event1 true), the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces the next state to have event2. Therefore in the next state event1 does not happen. That means C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

(If one allowed both events to occur simultaneously in a state, C2 could be false; under the usual reading that the rules force the next state's event, the correct answer is True.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 says: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately after the initial one, event1 does not happen.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so at time 0: event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at time 1: event2 must occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at time 2: event1 must occur), etc.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Time 0: event1 (given).
- Time 1: by ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 occurs at time 1.
- There is no rule forcing event1 to also occur at time 1; the requirement is that event2 occur at time 1. Under the usual reading that these specify which event must occur in the next state (and events are taken as the required occurrences), time 1 contains event2 and not event1.
- Time 2: by ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 occurs at time 2, and so on (alternation).

Conclusion
- In the next state (time 1) event1 does not happen, so C1 holds there. Therefore C2 is True.

(Footnote: If one instead allowed events to co-occur freely so that nothing prevents event1 from also happening at time 1, C2 would not be guaranteed. Under the standard interpretation used above — the obligations force the alternating occurrences — C2 is True.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and C1:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. (Also after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant here.)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- Given the context, event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, so event1 cannot occur in a subsequent state. Therefore C1 is false (it cannot hold).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Moreover, even conceptually, if C1 did hold (i.e. event1 happens in the next state), then event1 indeed happens (in that next state), so the implication would also be true in that hypothetical.
- Thus C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First, the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false.

Examine C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- Initially event1 already happened.
- The context says: after event1, no other events can happen.
- Therefore in the next state no events occur, so event1 does not happen in the next state.
So C1 is false.

Now C2 is the implication (C1 → event1). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the pieces
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen (so the next state has no events). Also after event2 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (an implication with C1 as antecedent)

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- Since event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- An implication ""If C1 then event1"" is true whenever the antecedent C1 is false (vacuous truth). Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — meaning of the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (relative to the initial state s0, this means event1 happens in s1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (relative to s0, this means that at s1 the statement C1 is true — i.e., at s1 event1 happens in s2).

Step 2 — apply the context
- Initially (s0) event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ⇒ event1 happens in s1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" ⇒ once event1 occurs in s1, no events (including event1) can occur in s2 or later.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true at s0 because event1 indeed happens in s1.
- C2 requires event1 to happen in s2 (so that C1 is true at s1). But by the context, after the event1 in s1 no further events can happen, so event1 cannot happen in s2.

Conclusion
- C2 is False

False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" = X(event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X(C1) = X X(event1) (event1 happens two states from now).

Step 2 — interpret the context as timeline of states
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → event1 must occur in the next state s1 (so X(event1) is true at s0).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → once event1 occurs in s1, no events (including event1) can occur in s2 or later.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial state s0
- C1 = X(event1) is true at s0 because event1 must occur in s1.
- C2 = X X(event1) asserts event1 occurs in s2; but after event1 in s1 no events can occur, so event1 cannot occur in s2. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., at the immediate next step).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the next state, C1 is true — equivalently, event1 happens in the state after the next (two steps from now).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so we are at the state right after event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen. Interpreting “must happen” with the usual next-step reading used by C1, that forces event1 to occur in the immediate next state.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there can be no events in any subsequent state).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From the initial state: the next state (state1) must contain event1 (by the “after event2, event1 must happen” rule), so C1 is true in the initial state.
- But C2 claims that C1 is true in state1 — i.e., that event1 occurs in state2. That would mean event1 occurs after event1, contradicting “after event1, no other events can happen.”

Conclusion
- C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the formula event1 → event1.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" i.e. at some point in the execution, C1 is true.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- event1 → event1 is a logical tautology: whenever you evaluate it at any state, it is true (a proposition implies itself).
- The context gives the execution trace constraints: event1 happens initially, then event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else happens. So a representative trace is: event1 (now), event2 (next), end.

Step 3 — Trace and reasoning
- Because C1 is a tautology, it holds at every point in time in every trace (in particular it holds at the initial state where event1 has happened).
- Therefore ""eventually C1 holds"" is satisfied immediately (it already holds now).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical self-implication P → P, which is a tautology (always true) at any point in a trace, regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.

Step 3 — examine C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 holds at some future point (eventually).
- Because C1 is true at every point (it already holds now), C1 certainly holds at some future point — indeed immediately.

Step 4 — relation to the context:
- The context (order of event1 and event2) is irrelevant because C1 is universally true; thus C2 is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication: whenever event1 occurs, the consequent event1 also occurs — so C1 is true at any moment where it is evaluated, and in fact is true whenever the implication is interpreted classically.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means that at some point in the execution, C1 is true.

Step 3 — trace the allowed event sequence
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial moment, event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (execution ends).
- So the actual sequence is: event1 then event2, then termination.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- At the initial moment event1 happened, so the antecedent of C1 is true and the consequent is true as well; therefore C1 holds at that moment.
- Since C1 already holds initially, ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

C2 asserts that ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) holds in the next state. We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the immediate next event after the initial event2 is event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate thereafter).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
Starting from the initial state where event2 happened, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to have event1. Therefore, in that next state event2 does not occur.

Conclusion
C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event2 does not happen.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so the current/initial state has event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, the following state must have event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, the following state must have event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
Because initially event2 happened, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to contain event1. That next state therefore contains event1 (and, under the usual single-event-per-state reading, does not contain event2).

Step 4 — conclude
Thus in the next state event2 does not happen, so C1 holds in the next state. Therefore C2 is True.

Step 1 — identify the question

- Initially event2 has happened (in the current state).
- Rule A: after event2, event1 must happen (so the next state must have event1).
- Rule B: after event1, event2 must happen (so the state after that must have event2).
(Assume one event occurs per state/step.)

Step 3 — apply the rules
- Because event2 happened initially, by Rule A the next state must have event1.
- If the next state has event1, then event2 does not happen in that next state.

Step 1 — What is being asked
We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the current state event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state following any state with event1, event2 holds).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so after any state with event2, event1 holds).
Thus the events must alternate: starting with event1 now, the next state must have event2, then the following state event1, and so on.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1
C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the alternation above, the next state after the initial event1 must be event2. Therefore C1 is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2
C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication is true whenever its antecedent is false (vacuous truth). Since C1 is false, the implication C2 is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens in the next state.

True

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C2 is essentially the implication: (Event1 happens in the next state) -> (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so in the next state event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so event1 will occur one step later (two steps from the initial state).
- Therefore C1 (event1 happens in the next state) is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Logically, C2 is either a trivial tautology (it says ""if event1 happens next state then event1 happens"") or, more generally, an implication with a false antecedent.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true in classical logic. Even reading C2 as the identical antecedent/consequent, it is trivially true.

- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events are possible.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur after it.)

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- Because event1 happened initially, we are already in a state where ""after event1"" applies; therefore no events can occur after that point.
- That forbids any occurrence of event2 following the initial event1.
- Could event2 occur before the initial event1? No — the statement says event1 happened initially, so there is no earlier time for event2.
- Could event2 occur and then force event1 to happen after it? That would require event2 to occur before an event1 that follows it; but event1 already happened initially and blocks any further events, so such a sequence is impossible.

Thus event2 cannot occur in any possible execution. So C1 holds in all executions, and therefore C2 is True.

- Because event1 has already happened in the initial state and no events can occur after event1, no events (including event2) can occur after the initial moment.
- Event2 could only occur if it happened before event1, but the context fixes event1 as the initial event (no prior events are allowed), so event2 cannot have occurred before.
- The “after event2, event1 must happen” constraint is either redundant (event1 already happened) or impossible to satisfy if event2 were to occur after the initial event1 (but that’s forbidden). So there is no consistent trace in which event2 occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 cannot occur in any allowed execution, so C1 holds in all executions. Therefore C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution consistent with the context, event2 never occurs.
We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So every execution starts with event1 already having occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus once the initial event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (no events are allowed after event1), and event2 cannot occur before initial event1 because event1 is initial.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- The only possible execution is: event1 occurs initially, then nothing else ever happens.
- There is no execution in which event2 occurs.

Conclusion
- C1 is true in every possible execution, so C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point there is a state whose next state has event1).

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at time 0 event1 occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from time 0 onward there are no further events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 occurs later; but event2 cannot occur after event1 because no events can happen.

Step 3 — trace and reasoning
- At the initial moment, the next state does not contain any events (because no events can happen after event1), so C1 is false now.
- Because no events can ever occur after the initial event1, there is no future state in which event1 occurs in that state's next state. Thus C1 can never become true later.
- The clause about event2 is vacuously satisfied (event2 never occurs) and does not make C1 true at any future point.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a property of the current state: the immediately following state has event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (at some future state, C1 will be true).

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 already occurs at the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen — once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur after the initial event1 (no events can occur after event1).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen afterward, there is never a later state in which an event occurs. In particular, event1 cannot occur in any future (next) state.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false in the initial state (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- Since no events ever occur after the initial state, there will never be a state where C1 is true. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — this is a property of a state s meaning: at s's immediate successor state, event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state where C1 is true (i.e., at some time t the next state has event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at time 0).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur at times ≥1).
- After event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The only possible trace: event1 at time 0, and then no events ever again.
- At time 0, C1 asks whether event1 happens at time 1 — it does not (no events at time 1).
- For any later time t ≥ 1, no events occur at time t+1 either, so C1 is false at every time.

Step 4 — conclusion
- There is no time when ""event1 happens in the next state"" holds, so C1 never holds, and thus C2 (""eventually C1"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 happened, event1 therefore happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen — that just says event1 is terminal, which is consistent with event2 then event1.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens"". Since event2 (and also event1) happen, C1 is true.
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event1 happens"". C1 is true (and event1 is also true), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens). Note C2 logically simplifies to (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens) (because OR is idempotent).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened → event2 did occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will (and therefore does) occur after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal, but it still happens.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- event2 happens (initially).
- event1 happens (must follow event2).
- Therefore both event2 and event1 happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 is true (event2 or event1 holds, in fact both hold).
- C2 is equivalent to C1, and since event1 happens (and C1 holds), C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true in the scenario.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will (eventually) happen as well.
- After event1, no other events can happen (meaning event1 is terminal), but that doesn't prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — evaluate the claims
- C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens). Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens). Because C1 is already true, C2 is true. (Logically C2 simplifies to event2 OR event1, same as C1.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide the truth of C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""  
- C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" So C2 is: event1 -> (not event2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So in the actual scenario event2 has occurred.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Because event2 happened initially, no events can happen at any later time — in particular event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial event2.
- Also there is a rule ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" but that only applies if event1 does occur.

Step 3 — reason about possible occurrences
- Given event2 already occurred initially and no events can occur after it, event1 cannot occur in any allowed execution. So the antecedent of C2 (event1 happens) is impossible in the given context.
- In classical logic an implication with an impossible antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Although C1 is actually false (event2 did happen), that does not make the implication false because the antecedent never holds.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---

---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C2 states: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is ""Event2 does not happen,"" C2 is the claim: if event1 happens then event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened. So event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means no events can occur after the initial event2 — in particular, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 can never occur (event2 already occurred first and blocks any subsequent events).

Step 3 — Reason about the implication
- Because event1 cannot happen in any timeline consistent with the premises, the antecedent of C2 (""event1 happens"") is impossible/false.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true), regardless of the truth of the consequent.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point (now or later) it becomes true that event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once event1 has occurred, no event (including event2) can ever occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur given the second condition.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event1 has already happened initially, from that point on no other events can happen, so event2 does not and cannot happen.
- Thus C1 holds immediately (and forever).

Conclusion:
- C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., no occurrence of event2 in the run)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some time in the run it becomes true that event2 does not happen — equivalently, there is a time from which event2 never occurs; since C1 is a global statement, if it is true now then it eventually holds)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the outset event1 has already occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur after that point.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This is an implication: if event2 ever happens, then event1 must (also) happen after it. But event1 already happened initially, and in any case the previous rule forbids any events after event1.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 has happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no possible occurrence of event2 at any later time.
- There is no way for event2 to have occurred before the initial moment (the statement says ""Initially, event1 happened""), so event2 cannot occur at all in the run.
- The third condition (if event2 happens then event1 must happen) is moot because event2 never happens; it does not force any additional behavior that would allow event2.

Step 4 — conclude about the hypothesis
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true in the run.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true (in fact C1 holds from the start).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. at some point in time it becomes true that event2 does not happen — in practice this means C1 is true from some time onward.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once that initial event1 has occurred, there can be no further events ever).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 were to occur, then event1 would have to occur afterward).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No — the problem states event1 happened initially, i.e. at the start, so there is no earlier time for event2.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is true.
- Since C1 is already true from the start, it certainly ""eventually holds.""

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Question: Is C2 true?

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 has happened (so at the initial moment event2 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred, the system stays in that state; no further events occur).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- At the initial moment event2 has already happened, so C1 is true initially (event2 holds).
- Because after event2 no other events can ever happen, no future state can remove the fact that event2 has happened. Thus in every state from the initial one onward, event2 has happened, so C1 remains true at all times.
- Whether or not event1 ever occurred earlier is irrelevant — C1 is already guaranteed by event2 having happened initially and persisting.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in every reachable state, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the context.

Understand the statements:
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") is true (because event2 happened).
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event2 is terminal — once it occurs, no further events (including event1) can occur.

Trace possible sequences:
- Because event2 already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no other events can ever occur after that. In particular, event1 never occurs at any later time.
- C1 is true at the initial moment (due to event2), but at times after the initial moment there are no events occurring, so at those times ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" is false.

Therefore C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
First identify what is being claimed:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens"" — this is a statement about a given moment (i.e. at that point an event occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. at every moment in the execution, either Event1 or Event2 happens.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened (so at the initial moment C1 is true).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (irrelevant here because Event1 never needs to occur).
- After Event2, no other events can happen (so once the initial Event2 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences).

Trace a possible execution:
- At time 0: Event2 occurs → C1 is true at time 0.
- At any subsequent time: no events can occur (by the third rule), so neither Event1 nor Event2 happens at those times → C1 is false at those times.

Because there are later moments where neither event occurs, C1 does not hold at all times. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true whenever evaluated: if event1 occurs it is trivially satisfied, and if event1 does not occur it is vacuously true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means there is some future point at which C1 is true.

Step 3 — use the context to trace events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur at some point.
- After event1, no other events can happen (termination), but that does not prevent C1 from holding at the moment event1 occurs (or at any time).

Step 4 — conclude
- Since event1 will occur, and C1 is true whenever evaluated (in particular at the time event1 occurs), C1 does hold at some future point. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. What is being asked: C2 asserts that ""C1 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

2. Examine C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true in every state regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.

3. Therefore C1 holds immediately (in every state). ""Eventually C1"" is satisfied because C1 is already true now (and hence at some future point).

4. The provided event sequence (event2 then event1 then nothing) indeed contains event1, but that is unnecessary for C2—C1 would still be true even if event1 never occurred because the implication is tautological.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the formula ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 → event1).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some point in the execution where C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula p → p is a logical tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether p (event1) occurs.

Step 3 — trace/relate to the context
- The context (event2 then event1 then nothing) does not affect the truth of the tautology: C1 holds at every point in the execution, including initially and after event1.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 holds immediately (in every state), ""eventually C1"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, and the rules say that after event2 no other events can happen — so the run consists only of the initial state where event2 occurs (there is no successor state).
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true at that initial state: along the (single-state) run event2 holds at every state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. But there is no next state after the initial one, and the ""next"" operator is false when no successor exists. Therefore C2 is false.
---
First, interpret the statements:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (read as a global/always property: at every state along the execution, event2 holds.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, the property C1 is true.)

Given the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the next state is terminal with no events occurring).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur).

Trace the execution:
- Initial state: event2 happened.
- Next state: terminal; no events occur in that state (event2 does not hold there).

Does C1 hold in the next state? C1 requires event2 to hold at every state. In the next state event2 does not hold, so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as ""in the current state and every future state, event2 holds"" (the usual G/eventually-free meaning).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — interpreted as the next-state operator X: there must be a successor state and C1 must be true there.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 holds in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen — the state with event2 has no successor (it is terminal).
- The clause ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurred.

Step 3 — Trace/reasoning
- C1: In the initial (and only) state, event2 holds; there are no future states, so ""event2 always happens"" (i.e., holds in every state of the trace) is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" requires a next state. But there is no next state (the state is terminal), so the next-state formula is false under the standard semantics where Xφ is false if no successor exists.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), true in any state where the formula is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., the next-state (X) modality applied to C1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so the initial state has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen → the state reached after the initial event2 is terminal (there is no successor/next state).
- The clause ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur (we're already at event2 and the state is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about C2
- C1 itself is true in any state, including the initial state.
- C2 requires that C1 be true in the next state. But there is no next state (the initial state is terminal), and in standard next-state semantics Xφ is false when no successor exists.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P) — it is true in any state regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen, so the state following the initial one has no events occurring.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state
- Even if in the next state event2 does not occur, the implication ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"" is vacuously true.
- If, hypothetically, event2 did occur in the next state, the implication is still true (P → P holds).
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer:
True
---
Short answer: False

Brief justification:
- C1 (""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"") is a tautology and would hold in any state that exists.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., ""next C1"").
- The context says initially event2 happened and that after event2 no other events can happen — so there is no successor/next state after the initial state.
- A ""next"" assertion is false when there is no next state to evaluate it in, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will happen after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen (this doesn't prevent event1 from happening).

From the context we deduce that both event2 and then event1 occur, so C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 states (Event1 and Event2) → Event1. That is a standard logical consequence (conjunction elimination): if a conjunction is true, each conjunct is true.
- Since C1 is true in the context and Event1 is true, the implication C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" So C2 is the implication C1 ⇒ event1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will happen after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (no further events needed here).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence:
- From the conditions we get the sequence: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs. So both event2 and event1 happen, i.e. C1 is satisfied in this scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 explicitly asserts that event1 happens (C1 = event1 ∧ event2). Therefore whenever C1 holds, event1 holds. So the implication C1 ⇒ event1 is true. (Even if C1 were impossible, the implication would be vacuously true; here it is actually realizable.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given C1 and the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and the context
- C1 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" So C1 explicitly includes ""event1 happens.""
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 does indeed occur after the initial event2.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (Doesn't prevent the two events from having occurred.)

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- Logically, if C1 is true (i.e., ""event1 happens and event2 happens""), then event1 is true (conjunction implies each conjunct). So the implication C1 ⇒ event1 is true by structure.
- The context also supports that C1 can hold (event2 occurs initially and event1 must follow), so the implication is not only tautologically true but consistent with the scenario.

- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened (and it has, initially), no further events can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (This is irrelevant once we know event1 already blocks further events.)

- The initial occurrence of event1 immediately prevents any subsequent events. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any later time in this execution.

Step 4 — conclude
- C1 is true in the given scenario (event2 does not happen).
- Because event1 already occurred initially and prevents any further events, there is no possible execution in which event2 happens; thus C1 holds in all executions.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible execution consistent with the context, Event2 does not happen).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So the system starts with event1 having occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, no further events are possible.
- (The clause ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- The initial event1 has occurred and, by the second condition, blocks any subsequent events.
- There is no earlier time before the initial state in which event2 could have occurred; simultaneous occurrence is not stated and ""after"" excludes later events.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur in any execution consistent with the given facts.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in all possible executions, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in all times/models, event2 never happens).

Step 2 — Examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. That is the starting point.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events at any later time.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 occurs; it does not enable event2.

Step 3 — Trace possible event sequences:
- Event1 has already occurred initially. Because after event1 no other events can happen, there is no later time at which event2 could occur.
- Event2 cannot have occurred before the initial moment (there is no ""before initial"" in this setup).
- Simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment would require the context to state that event2 also happened initially; it does not. So the only consistent reading is that event2 does not occur at any time.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2:
- C1 (event2 does not happen) is entailed by the facts.
- Therefore C1 holds in all possible situations consistent with the context; C2 is True.

- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So the state reached after the initial event is terminal — there is no successor state.)
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur).

Step 3 — examine C1
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" In the single (initial) state of the trace event2 did happen, and there are no later states to falsify this, so C1 is true on the (single-state) run.

Step 4 — examine C2
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. But there is no next state (after event2 no other events can happen), so the ""next-state"" claim fails — the next-state operator requires a successor state. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", where C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

2. From the context: initially event2 happened, and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So the only possible behavior is that event2 occurs initially and then the system has no further events.

3. What C1 requires: ""Event2 always happens"" is a global property meaning event2 must occur at every future point. It would require event2 to hold in the next state as well.

4. Evaluate C1 in the next state: after the initial event2 there are no further events, so the next state (if any) does not have event2 occurring. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every state along the execution, event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state, event2 always happens).

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen — the state reached after event2 is terminal (it has no successor).

Step 3 — Reasoning about C1 and C2
- C1 can be true in the initial state: since event2 holds in the only state that exists, ""event2 always happens"" is satisfied on that (finite) execution.
- C2 requires a next state in which C1 holds. But there is no next state after the state where event2 happened (the system is terminal), so C2 fails — there is no successor state in which to evaluate C1.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and therefore true in all situations.

Step 3 — examine the context:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so event1 is true as well.
- The other context facts (event2 follows event1; after event2 nothing else happens) are consistent but not needed once we know C1 is a tautology and event1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: (C1 is true) OR (event1 is true).
- Since C1 is true (tautology), the disjunction is true (and in fact event1 is true too).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event2 → event2).
- C2: (C1) ∨ (event1).

Step 2 — Evaluate C1:
- In propositional logic, (p → p) is a tautology, so C1 is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- Also from the context, event2 does occur (event1 happened and ""after event1, event2 must happen""), so C1 is certainly true.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""C1 or event1"". Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event1's truth value.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked:
- Determine whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (event2 → event2). That is a logical tautology and therefore holds unconditionally.

Step 3 — examine C2:
- C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or event1 happens"".
- Since C1 holds (tautology), the disjunction is true regardless of the truth of event1.
- (Additionally, the context states event1 did happen initially, so the second disjunct is also true.)

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event2 eventually happens."" From the context: event1 already happened initially, and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 is guaranteed to occur at some time — C1 is true.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" Because C1 is already true now, there exists a time (the present) at which C1 holds; therefore C1 holds at some time and so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied.

Thus C2 is True.
---
Step-by-step:

- C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds,"" i.e. ""Eventually (Event2 eventually happens).""

From the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 is guaranteed to occur at some point.
- Therefore C1 is true (event2 will eventually happen).

If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" is also true (it holds already, and hence at some point it holds). Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e. at some time in the future, event2 will occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some time from now onward, the statement C1 will be true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 will occur at some time after the initial moment.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant for existence of event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C1 and C2
- Given the rules, event2 does indeed occur, so C1 is true (already true at the initial moment).
- C2 asks whether there exists some time at or after now when C1 is true. Since C1 is true now, such a time exists (the current time). Also, in temporal logic F(F p) ≡ F p, so ""eventually eventually event2"" is equivalent to ""eventually event2"".

- C2 is True."

- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" → event2 is true.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" → this states exactly that if event2 happens then event1 happens, so C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:

Step 1 — what is being asked:
C2 asserts ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds"", where C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" You ask whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. That means C1 (event2 → event1) is entailed by the context.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant to the truth of C1 or the disjunction C2.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
C2 is ""event2 OR C1"". Since event2 is true, the disjunction is true (a disjunction is true if either disjunct is true). Also C1 is true as well, but only one disjunct needs to be true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis parts
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""  
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — Evaluate C1
- C1 is a trivial/tautological conditional: it is true in every situation (whether or not event1 actually occurs). So C1 holds.

Step 3 — Check the consequent of C2
- The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen in the given situation; thus the consequent of C2 is true.

Step 4 — Put it together
- Since C1 holds (antecedent of C2) and event2 happens (consequent), the conditional C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (an identity implication). It is always true in any situation, so C1 holds.

Step 3 — use the context about events
- The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true (it has occurred).
- The constraints ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen"" do not prevent event2 from having happened initially.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication (C1 → event2). C1 is true (tautology) and event2 is true (given by the context), so the implication is true.

True

- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Event2 eventually happens"".

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so from the initial event1 there must be a later event2).
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 must occur later, yielding an alternation).

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Starting from the initial event1, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces an event2 at some later time.
- Therefore event2 does indeed occur (and then the rules force an alternating infinite sequence if continued).

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2:
- Since event2 must occur after the initial event1, C1 will eventually hold; therefore C2 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction ""event2 or event2"" is just event2).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""eventually Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially Event1 has happened.
- Rule A: after Event1, Event2 must happen (so any occurrence of Event1 requires a later Event2).
- Rule B: after Event2, Event1 must happen (so any occurrence of Event2 requires a later Event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because Event1 has already happened initially, Rule A requires that Event2 occur at some later time. That guarantees at least one occurrence of Event2 (and then Rule B would require a subsequent Event1, and so on), but we only need that Event2 eventually occurs once.

Conclusion
- C2 (""eventually Event2 happens"") is satisfied.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the formula ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", i.e. simply ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Eventually Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially Event1 happened.
- ""After Event1, Event2 must happen"" — meaning whenever Event1 occurs, Event2 must occur later.
- ""After Event2, Event1 must happen"" — enforces alternation but is not needed to show Event2 will occur at least once.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because Event1 has already happened initially and the rule says after Event1, Event2 must happen, there must be a future occurrence of Event2.

Conclusion
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens"") will hold at some future time, so C2 (""Eventually Event2 happens"") is True.

Step 2 — Examine C1
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" That is logically equivalent to just ""Event1 happens"" (a conjunction of the same proposition).

Step 3 — Evaluate the implication in C2
- The implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" becomes: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" That is a tautology (it follows trivially).

Step 4 — Check for contradictions with the context
- The context states event1 initially happened and places no restriction that would make ""event1 happens"" false. Nothing in the context invalidates the implication. So the implication remains valid.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The hypothesis asks about C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens,"" which is equivalent to just ""Event1 happens.""

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the formula ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunct, equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. Event2 holds in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event1 happened (current state: Event1 = true).
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means the state immediately after any state where Event1 holds must have Event2.
- (The other rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ensures alternation, but we only need the consequence of the first rule for the next state.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At the initial state Event1 is true.
- By the rule, in the next state Event2 must be true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since Event2 is true in the next state, C1 (equivalent to Event2) holds in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Hypothesis: C2 says C1 holds in the next state. C1 is simply ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction ""event2 and event2"" is redundant).
2. Context: initially event1 is true. The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 in the next state.
3. Therefore in the next state (immediately after the initial state) event2 does happen, so C1 is true there.
4. Hence C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is just ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., Event2 holds in the immediate next state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially (state0) Event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: if Event1 holds in some state, then Event2 must hold in the next state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" similarly enforces alternation but doesn't prevent Event2 in the next state after state0.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- state0: Event1 (given).
- By ""after event1 → event2"", state1 must have Event2.

Therefore C1 (Event2) holds in the next state (state1), so C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e. event1 → event1)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is a logical tautology: P → P is always true for any proposition P. It does not depend on whether P actually occurs or on the dynamics of the system.

Step 3 — consider the context
- The context (event1 happened initially; event1 implies event2 later; event2 is terminal) does not affect the tautological truth of C1. Whether event1 occurs once, repeatedly, or leads to event2, C1 (P → P) remains true in every state.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in every state, so ""C1 always holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true or false. C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is the proposition (event1 → event1). This is a logical tautology (an instance of A → A), so it is true in every state/trace regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.

Step 3 — check the context for any counterexample:
- Context shows a specific trace: event1 happens initially, then event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else happens. This trace certainly satisfies C1.
- More generally, there is no possible trace consistent with the context that would make C1 false, because C1 is a tautology.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds in all states/traces; therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""C1 always holds.""
- C1 is: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e., event1 → event1)

Step 2 — Examine C1:
- The formula p → p is a logical tautology: it is true whether p is true or false (true when p is true, and true vacuously when p is false).

Step 3 — Consider the context:
- The given facts about event1 and event2 do not affect the tautological status of C1. C1 is true in every state/trace regardless of which events occur.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- Since C1 is always true, the statement ""C1 always holds"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true (it did happen).

2. C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" An implication A → B is true whenever B is true. Since event2 is true, C1 is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

3. C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Because C1 is already true, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of event1.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"", where C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about C1:
- If event1 never happens, the conditional ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is vacuously true. Given that event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after that, there is no sequence in which event1 occurs later; so the antecedent never holds, making C1 true.
- Even in the alternative case where event1 happened simultaneously with the initial event2, event2 still happened, so C1 would still be true.

Step 4 — conclude C2:
- Since C1 is true, ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, nothing else (including event1) can occur afterward.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 were to occur, it would also be terminal.)

Step 2 — Do any events actually occur besides event2?
- Because event2 happened initially and that prevents any further events, event1 does not occur at any time.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""):
- In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth).
- Since event1 never happens in this scenario, C1 is true vacuously.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens""):
- C1 is true, event1 is false, so C1 ∨ event1 = True ∨ False = True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false).
You are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes event1 terminal: no further events can occur in any run that begins with event1.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That says event2 would also be terminal if it occurred, but it does not assert that event2 actually occurs.

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequences:
- Since initially event1 has happened and event1 prevents any further events, event2 cannot happen in this scenario.
- Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) always happen — in fact it does not happen at all given the initial conditions.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is the negation of C1, so C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C2 is the claim ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any time.
- Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is thus true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:

- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, no further events — including event2 — can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about event sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and that prevents any further events, event2 cannot occur in this scenario.
- Therefore event2 does not always happen (indeed it does not happen at all here).

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (a propositional implication event2 → event2)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (Event1 ∧ C1)

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 is true.
- C1 is a logical tautology (p → p), which is always true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.

Step 3 — combine:
- Event1 is true and C1 is true, so their conjunction C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context facts/rules:
  - Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true at the initial point.)
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P) and is always true.
- C2: conjunction of ""Event1 happens"" and C1.

Step 3 — trace/consistency
- The dynamics (event1 → event2 and event2 → event1) produce an alternating sequence, but they do not negate the fact that event1 happened initially.
- Since event1 did happen initially, the first conjunct of C2 is satisfied.
- C1 is trivially satisfied.

Conclusion
C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts (a) ""Event1 happens"" and (b) ""C1 holds"", where C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true at least initially.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So from an occurrence of event1, event2 will occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So from an occurrence of event2, event1 will occur.
- Thus event1 and event2 force each other and will continue to occur in sequence.

Step 3 — analyze C1:
- C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Logically this is a tautology (P → P) and is therefore true.
- Also, from the context: if event2 happens then event1 happens (by the second rule) and then event2 happens again (by the first rule), so event2 indeed follows from event2—confirming C1.

Step 4 — combine for C2:
- ""Event1 happens"" is true (given initially).
- ""C1 holds"" is true (tautologically and by the cycle).
- Therefore C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's asked:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point C1 is true).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the context constraints:
- Initially, event1 happened (so at time 0 event1 occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here unless event2 can occur before event1).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" there are no future events at all. In particular, there cannot be an occurrence of event1 in the next state (no events can occur there).
- Thus C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false at every future point.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false — C1 will never become true.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C2 is the claim ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So we must decide whether C1 becomes true at some future point.

Step 2 — use the conditions
- Initially event1 happened (so the initial state has event1).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 can never occur (blocked by the earlier event1).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur afterward, there is no state in the future where event1 ""happens"" again (in particular, event1 does not hold in the next state).
- Thus C1 is never true at any state, so it never eventually holds.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a property about the immediate next state)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" i.e. at some future point there is a state from which the next state has event1.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the initial state).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" This means once event1 has occurred there are no further events in any subsequent state (it blocks any further events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (it would be blocked by the prior rule).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- At the initial state event1 has occurred.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, there will never be a later state where some event occurs. In particular there will never be a state whose next state contains event1.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C1 is false at the initial point (the immediate next state does not have event1).
- There is no future state at which C1 becomes true (no further events/states with event1 in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 says ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunction meaning ""Event1 happens"" (i.e., event1 occurs).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., eventually event1 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 occurs at most once and ends the sequence).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At the start event2 occurs.
- By the rule, event1 then must occur (so event1 does occur).
- That satisfies ""event1 happens"" (C1), and therefore C1 holds at some point.
- Hence C2 (""event1 eventually occurs"") is satisfied.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 states ""C1 eventually holds"".
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).

- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 is required after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (this just ends the sequence; it doesn't prevent event1 from occurring).

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Since event2 has already happened initially and the rule requires that after event2 event1 must happen, event1 will occur (eventually).
- Therefore C1 (which just says event1 happens) will eventually hold.

Final answer:

Summary of the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event2 → event2).
- C2 = (event1) ∨ C1.

Relevant facts from the context:
- event2 happens initially.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 does occur (after event2).
- After event1, no further events occur.

Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is the implication event2 → event2, which is true (the antecedent and consequent are both true in the given scenario; moreover the implication is tautologically true).
- Since event1 also happens in the scenario, the disjunction event1 ∨ C1 is true regardless.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether the statement C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens,"" i.e. event2 → event2. That implication is a logical tautology (always true), and in particular given the context (event2 did happen initially) C1 is true.

Step 3 — examine whether event1 happens
The context says: initially event2 happened, and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Since event2 did happen, event1 must happen. So event1 is true in the scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
C2 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are true (event1 happens and C1 holds), so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P) and is true whenever the conditional is evaluated; here event2 does happen, so C1 is true.
- Context rules:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace event sequence:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- By the rule, event1 must then occur.
- After event1, the sequence ends. So both event2 and event1 happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- Event1 happens (true), and C1 also holds (true). The disjunction ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" is therefore true.

- Therefore C1 (Event1 or Event2) is true because Event2 is true.
- Since C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 is also true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = (Event1 happens) OR (Event2 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (Event2 happens).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened. (So Event2 is true.)
- After Event2, Event1 must happen. (So Event1 will occur after the initial Event2.)
- After Event1, Event2 must happen. (They alternate, but we already have Event2 at start.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 = Event1 OR Event2. Since Event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2 = C1 OR Event2. Since C1 is true (and Event2 is also true), C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 is true at least initially.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → event1)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)
Thus the rules enforce that both events occur (they alternate), and in particular event2 does occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Because event2 happens, C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"". Since C1 is true (and event2 is also true), C2 is true.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does happen).

Step 2 — Examine the given conditions:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" → event2 did happen.

- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" → a constraint that would force event2 if event1 occurred, but also irrelevant because event2 already happened initially.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no later events are possible).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — reason about possible timings
- Because event1 happened initially, any event occurring after that is forbidden by ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? The statement says event1 happened initially, i.e., at the start of the timeline; there is no earlier time for event2 to have happened. Even if one considered simultaneous occurrence, ""after event2, event1 must happen"" requires event1 to occur after event2, which contradicts event1 already occurring initially (not after).
- Thus there is no consistent scenario in which event2 ever happens.

Step 4 — conclude
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

True
---
Let's reason step by step.

1. The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So at the start, event1 has already occurred.

2. It also says ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, there can be no subsequent events (no event2 after event1).

3. The third condition ""After event2, event1 must happen"" would require that if event2 occurs, event1 occurs afterward. But event1 already happened initially; more importantly, if event2 were to occur after the initial event1, that would contradict (2). If event2 were to occur before the initial event1, that contradicts ""Initially, event1 happened"" (there is no earlier time).

4. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time.

C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is false. C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event2 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 were to occur, event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially, we are in the “after event1” situation from the start.
- The rule “after event1, no other events can happen” therefore forbids any further events, including event2.
- The condition “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (we already have event1 and no further events are allowed). There is no way for event2 to have occurred before the initial event1 since event1 is stated to be initial.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the context.

- Context: Initially event1 happened. The rules state (1) after event1, event2 must happen, and (2) after event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (together with the fact event1 did happen initially), event2 must occur in the subsequent state. So C1 is true in this situation.
- Therefore, whenever event1 happens, C1 holds. There is no conflict with the ""after event2, no other events"" rule.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event2 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen — this gives a rule that whenever event1 happens, event2 follows (interpreted as in the next state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to whether event2 follows event1).

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" exactly matches the conditional in C2: whenever event1 occurs, event2 happens in the next state.
- Therefore C1 will hold whenever event1 happens, so the implication in C2 is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened.""
- Context rule: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That enforces that whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterwards (in the next state).
- Additional rule: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" This does not conflict with the previous rule.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given that event1 happened initially and the rule requires event2 after event1, C1 holds in this situation.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" exactly matches this implication (event1 ⇒ event2 next). Therefore C2 is entailed by the context.

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" So C2 is true iff at least one of these is true.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. That makes the proposition ""Event2 happens"" (in the initial/current state) true.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so in the next state no events occur. Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is false.

Step 3 — combine:
- C2 is a disjunction. The first disjunct (""Event2 happens"") is true (by the initial fact), so the whole disjunction C2 is true, regardless of C1 being false.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must decide the truth of C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:

- After event2, no other events can happen (so in the next state no events occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
- The disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Event2 did happen (initially), so the left disjunct is true.
- Therefore C2 is true (true ∨ false = true).

Final answer: True

Reasoning:

- Context facts:
  - Initially, event2 happened. So ""Event2 happens"" is true in the initial state.
  - After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore no events (including event2 again) can occur in any following state.
  - After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur).

- Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - Since after event2 no events can happen, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

- Evaluate C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
  - The left disjunct ""Event2 happens"" is true in the initial state (given). A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true, so C2 is true regardless of C1.

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Trace possible sequences:
- The initial event is event2.
- Since after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1) can occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore event1 never occurs in this execution.

Conclusion about C1:
- C1 claims event1 always happens. That is false, because we have a run where event2 happens initially and prevents event1 from ever occurring.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True. 

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 asserts ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible execution/trace, event1 occurs).
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does not always happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the start of execution, event2 has occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Event1, if it occurs, is terminal.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Event2 is terminal as well.

Step 3 — trace possible executions:
- The initial execution already has event2 and, because event2 is terminal, no further events (including event1) can happen in that execution.
- Therefore there is at least one execution in which event1 does not occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Since there exists an execution where event1 does not happen, the statement ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Thus ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible execution/event sequence).
- The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen.""
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can occur after it, event1 does not occur in that execution.
- Therefore there exists an execution where event1 does not happen, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" — that is true."

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e. event2 → event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The formula P → P is a tautology: it is true in any state (true when P is true, and also true when P is false).

Step 3 — trace the scenario:
- Initially event2 happened.
- By the rules, in the next state event1 must happen and event2 does not happen there (and after event1 no further events occur).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- In the next state, C1 (event2 → event2) is still true (it is a tautology, and additionally the antecedent is false there).
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the scenario.

Step 2 — Understand C1
- C1 is: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology of the form (A → A). Such an implication is true in any state: if A holds then A holds; if A does not hold then the implication's antecedent is false so the implication is still true.

Step 3 — Trace the states from the context
- Initial state s0: event2 happened (by ""Initially, event2 happened"").
- Next state s1: event1 must happen after event2.
- After s1: no further events can happen.

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 in the next state (s1)
- In s1, event2 does not happen (event1 happens and no other events do). As noted, an implication A → A with A false is true. So C1 holds in s1.

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.  

True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true or false, where C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C1 is a tautology (P → P), so it is true in any state regardless of whether event2 actually holds there.
- In the scenario there is indeed a next state (after the initial event2 the system goes to the state where event1 happens), but that doesn't matter because C1 is true in every state.
- Therefore C2 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the next state, Event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — given conditions:
- Initially (state S0), Event1 happened.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so in the next state after any Event1, Event2 occurs).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so after any Event2, the following state contains Event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At S0: Event1 happened (given).
- By ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"", in the next state S1 Event2 must happen.
- Thus in S1 we have Event2. Under the usual reading that a state contains the event required (and events are not simultaneously duplicated in that state), Event1 does not happen in S1.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") holds in the next state S1, so C2 is True.

(If one allowed events to co-occur in a state, S1 could contain both Event1 and Event2 and then C1 would be false; under the standard interpretation used here, events alternate, so the answer is:)

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (a proposition about a state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially (current state) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At the initial state: event1 happened.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", the next state must have event2 occur.
- In that next state, event2 occurs; therefore event1 does not occur in that next state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that in the next state, event1 does not happen. From the sequence, that is true.

Final answer: True

- After event1, event2 must happen → from t0 (event1) we get t1: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → from t1 (event2) we get t2: event1.
Thus the events alternate: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- At the next state t1, event2 holds and event1 does not hold. So C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is true at t1.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True or False.
- C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially (at the current state) event1 has happened.
- After any event1, event2 must happen next.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next.
Thus the system forces an alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1 at the current state
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true at the current state because event1 has already happened initially (eventually includes the present).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 in the next state (C2)
- Consider the next state (immediately after the initial state). By the rules, event2 must occur next, and then event1 must occur after that. So starting from the next state, event1 will occur in the future (after one step with event2).
- Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true in the next state.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Timeline forced by the premises: t0: event1 (initial). After event1, event2 must occur → t1: event2. After event2, event1 must occur → t2: event1. And so on (alternation).
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true at t0 (it already happened at t0).
- C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state (t1). From t1, event1 occurs at t2, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is true at t1.
Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the next state onward, event1 eventually happens.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
These constraints force event1 and event2 to alternate indefinitely starting from the initial event1.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At the initial state event1 has already happened, so C1 is true at the initial state.
- In the next state we must have event2 (or at least event2 will occur before any further event1), and after that event1 must happen again. Thus from the next state onward, event1 will occur eventually.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- C1 is the statement ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" evaluated at a given moment.
- The context says initially event1 happened, so C1 is true at the initial moment.
- The context also says that after event1 no other events can happen, so at every later moment neither event1 nor event2 occurs; therefore C1 is false at those later moments.
- ""C2: C1 always holds"" requires C1 to be true at every moment. Because C1 is false at times after the initial event, C2 does not hold.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C1 is the statement ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2 is the claim ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. in all possible executions given the constraints).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So every execution starts with event1 already having occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Once event1 has occurred, the system has no further events.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This only matters if event2 could occur; it forces event1 afterward.

Step 3 — examine possible executions
Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, the only possible execution is one where event1 has occurred and nothing else ever occurs. Event2 cannot occur in any execution (it would require happening after the initial event1, but no events can occur after event1).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
In every execution, event1 has occurred, so ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" is true in all executions. Therefore C1 holds in all executions, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. at every timepoint, C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial moment the proposition ""event1 has happened"" is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no future occurrence of event2 (or any other event) is possible.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — reason about C1 over time
- Since event1 already happened initially, the disjunction ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" is true at the initial time.
- The fact that event1 has happened is a persistent fact (it already occurred), so at all later times the statement ""event1 has happened"" remains true. Therefore C1 remains true at every timepoint.

Conclusion
- C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We are asked whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is True or False, given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 occurs, it is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 occurs, it is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event2 happened initially, we are already in a state ""after event2"". Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event1) can occur at any later time.
- There is no indication that event1 occurred before the initial state; ""initially, event2 happened"" places event2 at the start, so event1 did not happen at or after the initial moment.

Step 4 — evaluate the clauses:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the above, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; C1 is true, so C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds (i.e., Event1 happens OR Event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because event2 happened initially and no further events can occur after event2, Event1 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens or Event1 does not happen."" This is true in two ways: logically it is a tautology (A or not A), and in this specific scenario C1 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → event1 cannot happen after event2.
- Since event2 happened initially, event1 does not occur. Thus C1 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction of ""Event1 happens"" or ""Event1 does not happen."" That disjunction is true whenever C1 is true; it is also a logical tautology (P or not P).
- Given C1 is True from the context, C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so every occurrence of event1 is followed by an event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so occurrences alternate indefinitely).

Step 3 — examine C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" The context directly enforces this: every time event1 occurs it is followed by event2. So C1 holds (in fact it always holds, not just eventually).

Step 4 — examine C2
- C2 says C1 eventually holds. Since C1 already holds immediately (and thereafter), C2 is satisfied.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e., every time event1 occurs, event2 follows.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some time in the future the condition C1 is true.)

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After every event1, event2 must happen.
- After every event2, event1 must happen.
So the system produces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- In that sequence, whenever event1 occurs, a following event2 occurs. Therefore C1 is true (indeed it holds immediately and at all times).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Since C1 already holds, it certainly ""eventually holds.""

Final answer: True

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After any event1, event2 must happen.
- After any event2, event1 must happen.
So the system produces an alternating sequence event1, event2, event1, event2, ... indefinitely (starting with the initial event1).

Step 3 — examine C1 against the sequence:
- Every occurrence of event1 is followed by an event2 (by the given rule). Therefore the implication in C1 is true for every occurrence of event1. Thus C1 holds immediately and continues to hold at all times.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds. Since C1 already holds from the start and continues to hold, C2 is satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. Initially event1 happened, so C1 (event2 or event1) is true at the initial state.
2. The context says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" That means in the next state (the state after the initial one) neither event1 nor event2 occurs.
3. Therefore in the next state C1 (""event2 happens or event1 happens"") is false.
4. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; but we just showed C1 is false there.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the question: C2 asserts that ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must decide if that is true given the conditions.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So C1 (event2 or event1) is true in the initial state.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means there is no next state in which event2 or event1 occurs (either there is no next state at all, or the next state has no events happening).

Trace the sequence:
- At the initial state C1 is true (because event1 happened).
- In the next state, by the given constraint, no events occur. Thus neither event1 nor event2 happens there, so C1 is false in the next state.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one).

Step 2 — what we know about the system
- Initially, event1 happened, so C1 is true in the initial state (because event1 happened).
- Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means there is no successor/next state following the initial state (no transition out of it).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. But there is no next state to evaluate C1 in, because after event1 no other events can happen.
- Under the usual semantics where ""next"" requires an existing successor state, a formula that asserts something in the next state is false if there is no next state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the same proposition repeated, so C1 ≡ (event2).  
- C2 is ""event2 → C1"", i.e. event2 implies C1.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context states that initially event2 happened. So event2 is true in the scenario.
- Since C1 ≡ event2, C1 is true (because event2 is true).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication event2 → C1. With event2 true and C1 true, the implication is true. (More generally event2 → event2 is a tautology.)

Final answer:
True
---
The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false.

1. Examine C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""  
   From the context, event2 did happen initially, so C1 is true.

2. Examine C2: It states ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens,"" C2 is the implication ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens,"" which is logically true. (More directly: the antecedent is true in the context and the consequent is true as shown above, so the implication holds.)

Therefore C2 is True.

True

Step 1 — identify what's asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Context says: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen.
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is logically equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (a redundant disjunction).
- C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"", i.e. event2 → C1.

Step 3 — simplify and evaluate:
- Since C1 ≡ event2, C2 becomes event2 → event2.
- An implication p → p is always true (tautology). Also, in the given context event2 indeed happened, and C1 is true, so the implication holds.

- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds,"" i.e., ""event2 happens eventually.""

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which simplifies to ""event2 happens.""
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"", i.e. ""If event2 happens then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true in all models of the context.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur after it.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen at any time after the initial event. There is no consistent model in which event2 happens.
- Therefore the antecedent of C2 (event2 happens) is impossible under the context. Also, independent of that, event1 already happened initially.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true. Also, event1 is true anyway in the context.
- Hence C2 (""If event2 happens then event1 happens"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", i.e. simply ""event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"", i.e. ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the previous fact.)

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no possible timeline consistent with the context in which event2 happens. So the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is false in every model allowed by the context.

Step 4 — evaluate the implication
- An implication ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is true when the antecedent is impossible (vacuously true). Also, event1 actually did happen, so the consequent is true in the actual timeline anyway.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is simply ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2 is the implication ""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"" (event2 → event1).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once event1 has happened (which is at the initial point), no further events can occur.
- Hence event2 cannot occur at any time in any model consistent with the context.

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- In all models allowed by the context, C1 (event2 happens) is false.
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" holds in all models consistent with the context.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Given the premises, the only possible event sequence is: event1 (initial) → event2 → termination (no further events).
- Therefore, in every possible execution/event trace, event2 does occur. So C1 (""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., event2 occurs in every run) is true.
- Since C1 is already true from the start, ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also true.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This is exactly the content of C1.)

Step 3 — examine consequences:
- The given rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" makes C1 true (it asserts the implication).
- Even if event1 never occurs, the implication ""if event1 then event2"" is satisfied (vacuously true), and the explicit rule already guarantees it.
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction C2 (C1 OR event1) is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context gives: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That is exactly the content of C1 (if event1 happens, then event2 happens). So C1 is true in the context.
- Context also gives: ""Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 already happened initially and no events can occur afterward, event1 does not actually occur later. (Whether event1 ever occurred before the initial event2 is not stated, but it is unnecessary.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is (C1) OR (event1 happens).
- We have C1 = True from the context. True OR anything = True.

Conclusion: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (a conditional)
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens. (disjunction)

Step 2 — examine context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen. This directly states the conditional ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens,"" i.e. C1 is true in the context.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 holds (as given), the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens (and in fact event1 cannot happen after the initial event2).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True or False.
- C1 is: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true at the start.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So some time after the initial event2, event1 will occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So event1, when it occurs, is terminal.

Step 3 — Trace the possible event sequence
- The only allowable sequence consistent with the statements is: event2 (initially), then event1, then stop.
- In that sequence, whenever event1 occurs, event2 has already occurred earlier.

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is true in the run: every occurrence of event1 is preceded by the initial event2, so the implication holds.
- Because C1 already holds in the system (indeed from the start of the run), C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the execution C1 is true — in fact C1 turns out to be true immediately and thereafter).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true from the start of every execution.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur at some later point (given event2 has already happened).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Because event2 happened initially, any occurrence of event1 will be after an occurrence of event2. Thus whenever event1 happens, event2 has already happened.
- Therefore the implication ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (C1) is true already from the start (and remains true).
- If anything, C1 holds immediately, so it certainly ""eventually holds.""

Final answer
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Timeline given by the context: at t0 event2 happens; because ""after event2, event1 must happen"", at some later time t1 event1 happens; and because ""after event1 no other events can happen"", after t1 there are no further events.

- Treat ""eventX happens"" as true only at the instant the event occurs. Evaluate C1 (event1 -> event2) at times:
  - At t0: event1 is false, event2 true ⇒ implication true (vacuously).
  - Between t0 and t1: event1 false, event2 false ⇒ implication true.
  - At t1: event1 true, event2 false ⇒ implication false (this is the one moment C1 fails).
  - After t1: both events are false ⇒ implication true.

- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists a future time when C1 is true). Since C1 is true at times after t1 (indeed it becomes true and stays true after t1), C2 is satisfied.

Therefore C2 is True."

Step 1 — what C2 says:
C2 is the conditional ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" So we must evaluate the truth of that implication in the given scenario.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
C1 = ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" From the context, event2 did happen initially, and after event2 no other events can happen — hence event1 does not happen. That provides a counterexample to C1, so C1 is false in this scenario.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
C2 is an implication whose antecedent (C1) is false. A material conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true), regardless of whether event1 actually happens.

Therefore C2 is True.

Step 1 — Identify what’s being asked
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (the conditional event2 → event1)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e., (event2 → event1) → event1)
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Use the context facts
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is actually true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This only restricts events after event2; it does not prevent reasoning from using the fact that event2 occurred.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant unless event1 occurs.)

Step 3 — Reason about C2
- Assume C1 holds (assume event2 → event1 is true).
- Since event2 actually happened, from C1 (event2 → event1) and event2 we can conclude event1 (by modus ponens).
- Therefore, under the assumption that C1 holds, event1 must happen.

- C2 is True."

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 → event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (C1 is true in every state/time).

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula P → P is a logical tautology: it is true whether P is true or false (if P is true then P → P is true; if P is false then P → P is true by the definition of implication).

Step 3 — relate to the context
- The given event constraints (event2 then event1 then event2, ...) do not matter for the truth of the tautology. C1 is true in every state of the system regardless of which events occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C1 is always true, C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (a formula of the form P → P)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (claims C1 is true at every point in time)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus the system forces an alternating sequence event2, event1, event2, event1, ...; events occur repeatedly but that detail is not necessary for the logical form of C1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- The formula P → P is a logical tautology: it is true regardless of whether P (here ""event1 happens"") is true or false at a given time.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Since C1 is a tautology and therefore true at every time point, C1 indeed ""always holds.""

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
You ask whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine each condition
C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is of the form P → P, which is a logical tautology: it is true in every situation where the proposition P is well-formed.

Step 3 — consider the given event constraints
The context about event1 and event2 (initially event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen) describes a temporal alternation, but it does not affect the logical status of C1. Whether or not event1 ever occurs, the implication ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" is still true.

Step 4 — conclusion
Since C1 is a tautology and thus holds in all cases, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement: (C1 holds) → (event1 happens). We must determine whether this implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and logical form
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (E2 ∧ E1).
- C2 is (E2 ∧ E1) → E1. In propositional logic, (A ∧ B) → B is a tautology: if both A and B hold, then B holds.

Step 3 — consider the context (for completeness)
- Context says event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur after event1 (and in fact cannot occur at all given the initial event1). Thus C1 is impossible in this scenario, but that does not make the implication false — an implication with a false antecedent is still true (vacuous truth).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C2 is true (it is a logical tautology and remains true even if C1 is impossible).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e. Event2 ∧ Event1).
- C2 is the implication: (Event2 ∧ Event1) → Event1.

Step 3 — logical reasoning:
- The implication (A ∧ B) → B is a logical tautology: if both A and B hold, then B certainly holds. So C2 is true purely by logical form, regardless of the background facts.
- Also, in the given context, event1 has already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, so Event2 cannot occur; thus C1 is false and the implication is vacuously true.

Conclusion: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. What C2 says: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is ""event2 happens and event1 happens.""

2. Logical form: C2 is (event2 ∧ event1) → event1. Any formula of the form (A ∧ B) → B is a logical tautology, so it is true irrespective of the background facts.

3. Context check (optional): The context actually makes C1 impossible (event1 occurs initially and no events can happen after it, so event2 cannot co-occur), but that only means the antecedent of C2 is false — which still makes the implication true.

Therefore C2 is True."

- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 has already occurred at the start.)
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

- Because event2 happened initially, the statement ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (it already happened). So C1 is true in this system.

Step 4 — examine C2
- C2 says: if event2 happens, then event2 eventually happens (i.e., C1).
- This implication is trivially true: whenever event2 occurs at some time, it is indeed the case that event2 occurs at some time (so ""eventually event2"" holds). Given the context event2 does happen, and more generally the implication p → (eventually p) is satisfied here.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We are asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — restate conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus no event (including event2) can occur after that initial event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen. This is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (due to the previous rule), so the implication is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the first condition (event1 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 asserts that C1 is false.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" → event1 did happen.
- Other rules (after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 event1 must happen) do not negate that initial fact.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") contradicts the given initial fact, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" So we must decide whether C1 is false given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" => event1 does happen.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => nothing can occur after that, so event2 cannot occur later.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" => irrelevant because event2 cannot happen after event1; also event1 already happened initially.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the first sentence, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is the implication ""If Event1 happens, then Event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur at some point after event2.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is consistent with event1 occurring immediately after event2 and then nothing else happening.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Logically the implication ""If Event1 then Event1"" is a tautology (always true).
- In the given context event1 does indeed happen, so the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, so the implication holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Substituting C1 gives ""If event1 happens then event1 happens.""

Step 3 — logical evaluation
The implication ""if p then p"" (p → p) is a tautology: it is true for both p true and p false (when p is false the antecedent is false so the implication holds).

Step 4 — consistency with the context
The context actually guarantees event1 will happen (after event2), so C1 is true in the scenario and the implication still holds. But even without that, C2 is a logical tautology.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" (which is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"").
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" (i.e. C1 -> event1).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen — so from the initial state event1 will occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen — this only makes event1 terminal, it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 entails event1, event1 does indeed happen in the scenario.
- C1 is true exactly when event1 happens; here event1 happens, so C1 holds.
- C2 is the implication (C1 -> event1). Since C1 is equivalent to event1, this is (event1 -> event1), which is a tautology and therefore true in any case. Even without using the context, C2 is logically true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (formally: event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., C1 is true in every possible behavior compatible with the context)

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The formula event2 → event2 is a logical tautology (P → P). It is true whenever P is true and also true when P is false (vacuously). So C1 is true in any single execution/tracing point regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.

Step 3 — consider the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur in any continuation.
- After event2, event1 must happen (this is irrelevant here because event2 never actually occurs given the prior constraint).

Step 4 — put it together for C2:
- Since C1 is a tautology, it holds in every possible execution, including those where event2 cannot occur. Therefore C1 holds in all behaviors compatible with the context.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology of the form p → p.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That asks whether C1 is true in the system (at all relevant times/paths).

Step 2 — understand the context constraints
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur after it).

Given the initial condition, event1 has already happened, and no events can occur afterwards; therefore event2 never occurs in any possible continuation of the system.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (p → p) is true in any state/truth assignment (it is a tautology), and in particular it is vacuously true in traces where event2 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 holds in every possible trace/state of the system.
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. event2 → event2).
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. C1 is true in all situations).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen (so event2 can never happen after the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 does not occur).

Step 3 — Reason about C1:
- The formula event2 → event2 is a logical tautology: whenever event2 is true, event2 is true. In classical logic it is always true.
- Even if event2 never occurs, the implication is still true (vacuously true when the antecedent is false).

Step 4 — Reason about C2:
- Since C1 is a tautology, it holds in every state reachable under the given conditions. Therefore ""C1 always holds"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold."" The question asks whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" That is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" So C1 holds exactly when Event1 happens at some point.

Step 3 — use the context to determine if Event1 happens
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces Event1 to occur after that initial Event2.
- Once Event1 occurs, the rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" forces Event2 again, and the cycle continues. In particular, Event1 does indeed happen.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- Since Event1 happens, C1 is true.
- C2 asserts C1 does not hold, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalent to ""Event1 does not happen"".

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 does happen (after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → events alternate, so event1 does indeed occur.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- C1 holds (event1 happens), so C2 (the negation) is false.

Final answer: False

- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (A or A ≡ A).
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""Event1 does not happen"".

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will happen after the initial event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen, and so on, producing an alternating sequence; but the key point is that event1 does indeed occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Since the context guarantees event1 happens, C1 is true.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, so C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""event1 happens"". That holds in the initial state (given).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. event1 holds in the state after the current one.
- But the context says ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and event1 already happened initially, so there is no next state (no further events/states).
- With no next state, ""holds in the next state"" is not satisfied. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is just a tautological-looking repetition and is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. ""Event1 happens in the next state"".

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 occurs at the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has happened, there are no further events in any subsequent state (including event1 again).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1 (by the previous rule), and no event2 is given before the initial event1.

Step 3 — Trace the timeline
- At time 0 (initial): event1 happened (C1 true at time 0).
- At time 1 (next state): because no events can happen after event1, event1 does not happen at time 1.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- C2 asserts event1 happens in the next state; that is false given the rules.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" → equivalently ""event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. ""event1 holds in the next state"".

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so C1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen — no further event occurrences can occur in any following state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (no events can happen after event1).

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- Since no events can occur after the initial event1, event1 does not happen in any next state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (a conditional with antecedent C1)

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (state s0) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → in s1 we have event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → in s2 we have event1.
So the sequence is s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- From the initial state s0, the next state s1 has event2, not event1. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a material implication ""If C1 then event1"". A material implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Therefore C2 is true (regardless of whether the consequent holds, because C1 is false).

Final answer:
True
---
Step-by-step:

1. What the hypothesis asks:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (an implication with antecedent C1)

2. Evaluate C1 using the context:
   - Initially event1 happened (call that state S0).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state S1, event2 happens).
   - Therefore event1 does NOT happen in the next state S1. So C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 is the statement ""if C1 then event1."" This is either a tautological implication (if P then P) or, in classical logic, an implication whose antecedent is false.
   - An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Also if C1 were true it would assert the same fact, so it is trivially satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis items
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e., if event1 happens in the next state, then event1 happens)

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so in the next state (immediately after the initial event1) event2 must occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen → events alternate thereafter.

From this, C1 is false: the next state contains event2, not event1.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the conditional ""If C1 then event1."" C1 is precisely ""event1 happens in the next state,"" and the consequent is the same claim. A conditional of the form (A → A) is always true; more generally, in classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is also true (vacuous truth).
- Here C1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; even if you read the consequent as the same time as the antecedent, (C1 → C1) is tautologically true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e. C2 = C1 ∨ event2)

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Initially (current state) event2 happened — so event2 is true now.
- After event2, event1 must happen — so in the next state event1 must occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 will occur in the state after that, and so on.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 says event2 happens in the next state. Given the obligation, the next state must have event1, not event2, so C1 is false.
- C2 is C1 ∨ event2. Since event2 is true in the initial state, the disjunction is true regardless of C1.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: initially (now) event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state event1 occurs). After event1, event2 must happen (so the following state gets event2).
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (Here ""event2 happens"" without a time qualifier refers to the current/initial state.)

Step 3 — evaluate
- C1 is false: the next state must have event1 (not event2).
- ""event2 happens"" (unqualified) is true in the initial state because the context says event2 happened initially.
- Therefore C2 = (false) or (true) = true.

(If one instead reads the unqualified ""event2 happens"" in C2 as also meaning ""in the next state,"" then C2 would be false; but under the usual reading where unqualified events refer to the current state, C2 is true.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e., C1 ∨ (event2 happens))

Step 2 — interpret the context and timeline:
- Let S0 be the initial state. At S0 event2 happened (given).
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means at S1 (the next state after S0) event1 must hold.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means at S2 event2 holds, and so on. So the sequence is S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, …

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial state S0:
- C1 (""event2 in the next state"", i.e. at S1) is false, because S1 has event1.
- The disjunction C2 = C1 ∨ (event2 happens). The unqualified ""event2 happens"" is true at S0 (we are evaluating at S0 and event2 did happen there). So C2 is true (false ∨ true = true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — read as a global property that in every execution/event sequence event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some point in time from which C1 is true (in particular, if C1 is already true now, then it eventually holds).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened. That fixes every possible execution to start with event2.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so no execution can avoid that initial event2 or add other events afterward.
- The clause ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur (event2 already happened and blocks further events).

Step 3 — trace and conclusion
- Every possible execution has event2 (it happened initially and no further events can occur). Thus C1 holds.
- Since C1 holds from the start, it certainly holds at some (in fact every) future point — so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (interpreted as: at every time from now on, event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future time from which onward C1 is true; formally F G event2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (event2 occurs at the initial moment).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once that initial event2 occurs, no further events occur at any later time).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — trace the possible executions
- event2 occurs at the initial instant, then no events occur afterwards. Thus event2 does not repeatedly occur at later instants; it only happened at the initial instant.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false under the usual reading of events as instantaneous occurrences, because event2 does not hold at every future time—only at the initial moment.
- C2 requires that at some time from then on event2 holds at all times. There is no such time: after the initial instant nothing happens (so event2 does not hold repeatedly), hence C1 never becomes true, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event2 always happens."" C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time C1 becomes true).
2. From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. That means once we start, event2 has occurred and nothing can ever change that situation.
3. Therefore event2 holds at the initial moment and continues to hold for all future moments (no future events can undo it). So C1 (""event2 always happens"") is true already at the start.
4. Since C1 is true immediately, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true (it holds right away).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — a claim about the immediate successor state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — means C1 is true in every state (in particular it must hold at the initial state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — trace reasoning
- The only possible behavior consistent with the premises is: event1 occurs initially, and then no further events occur.
- Therefore the immediate next state after the initial state does not have event1 occurring (event1 already happened and no further events can occur).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is false at the initial state's next state, so C1 does not always hold.
- Hence C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “C1 always holds” — i.e. in every state, the next state contains event1.

Step 2 — restate the constraints
- Initially event1 happened (so the initial state has just experienced event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here unless event2 can occur).

Step 3 — reason about possible traces
- Because event1 already happened initially and “after event1 no other events can happen,” there are no subsequent events after that initial occurrence. Thus the next state after the initial one does not contain a new occurrence of event1 (indeed no events occur there).
- Therefore C1 is false at the initial state (the next state does not have event1).
- Since C1 fails in at least one state, C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning

- Initially (state s0) event1 has happened.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means any state that follows a state where event1 occurred has no events. So in the state s1 immediately after s0, no event occurs.
- C1 says ""event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state s1 has no events, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 holds in every state). Because C1 fails at s0, C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the formula ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (event1 → event1).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state.

Step 2 — analyze C1
- event1 → event1 is a tautology: for any truth value of event1 the implication is true (if antecedent true then consequent true because they are the same; if antecedent false the implication is true).

Step 3 — use the context about states
- The system has a next state (initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen), so the next state exists and in it event1 is true.
- But since C1 is a tautology it holds in every state (including that next state).

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e. event1 → event1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula event1 → event1 is a tautology (a proposition implies itself). It is true in every state regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.

Step 3 — existence of a next state
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Therefore there is a next state (in which event1 happens). Whether or not a next state existed is irrelevant for C1, since C1 is true in every state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Since C1 is true in every state, it in particular holds in the next state. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1 is the formula ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 → event1).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- The implication event1 → event1 is a logical tautology (it is true in any state regardless of whether event1 actually occurs).

Step 3 — trace the events (for completeness)
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rules force alternating events (after event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen), so the next state will indeed have event1. But this fact is unnecessary because C1 is already true in every state.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in the next state (since it holds in every state), so C2 is True.

- Therefore ""event2 happens"" is true.
- Therefore ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is also true (it has already happened).

Step 3 — evaluate ""event2 happens"":
Since event2 happened initially, the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — check for conflicts:
The other rules (""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen"") do not contradict that event2 already happened.

- After event1, event2 must happen — irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2 (see next point).
- After event2, no other events can happen — event2 is terminal, so no further events occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true because event2 has already happened at the initial time (so there exists a time at which event2 occurs).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in all possible sequences, Event2 never happens).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the start of the timeline event1 has already occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That makes event1 terminal: once it has occurred, no further events are allowed.
- After event2, event1 must happen. This requires that if event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur afterward (i.e., there must be a later occurrence of event1).

Step 3 — Reason about possible event sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no events can occur after that initial event1.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- Could event2 satisfy ""after event2, event1 must happen"" by occurring before the initial event1? No — the problem states event1 happened initially, so there is no earlier time for event2 to occur. Thus there is no possible timeline in which event2 occurs at all.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- C1 (Event2 does not happen) holds in every possible timeline consistent with the conditions.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution / future, event2 never happens.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So the timeline starts with event1 having occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means: at any time after the initial event1, no events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is an extra constraint but only matters if event2 can occur.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after it, there is no moment at which event2 can occur after the initial event1.
- There is no allowed occurrence of event2 at any later time. (Events are considered in the forward timeline starting from the initial state.)
- The constraint “after event2, event1 must happen” is vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs; it does not enable any trace that would violate the “no events after event1” rule.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 cannot happen in any allowed execution, so C1 holds.
- Since no allowed execution allows event2, C1 holds in all executions; therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all possible evolutions, event2 never happens.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the start event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur later).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — reason about possible traces
- Because event1 has already occurred initially, the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" prevents any event from occurring at any later time. That blocks any occurrence of event2 after the initial time.
- Could event2 have happened before the initial event1? The scenario states event1 happened initially (the start of the considered timeline); we do not have a prior history in which event2 could have occurred. So there is no allowed trace where event2 occurs before the initial event1.
- If one tried to let event2 occur after the initial event1, that would violate ""after event1 no other events can happen."" Additionally, if event2 were to occur and then require event1 afterward, that would be impossible because no events can occur after event1. So event2 cannot occur in any permitted trace.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In every possible (allowed) evolution consistent with the given conditions, event2 does not happen. Therefore C1 holds in all cases, so C2 is True.

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis: C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens or C1 holds,"" where C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""Event2 happens"" is true (at least at that initial time).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" exactly matches C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""), so C1 also holds.

Trace the sequence:
- Because event2 already happened, the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" is satisfied immediately.
- (Independently, C1 is true because the context enforces that whenever event1 occurs, event2 will follow.)

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds"", where C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened. So ""Event2 happens"" is true (at least once).
- After event2, event1 must happen, so event1 does occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so whenever event1 occurs it is followed by event2; that makes C1 true as well.

Step 3 — conclusion:
Since the left disjunct (""Event2 happens"") of C2 is already true, C2 is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether the statement C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So E2 is true (at least at the initial time).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" gives the implication E2 → E1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" gives the implication E1 → E2.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" — that is exactly E1 → E2, which the context asserts, so C1 holds.
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — a disjunction E2 ∨ C1.

Step 4 — conclude
- Since E2 is true (initially) and C1 is also true (from E1 → E2), the disjunction E2 ∨ C1 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., C1 ∨ event1)

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So because event1 happened initially, event2 must occur afterward.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So once event2 occurs, event1 will occur again (and this can repeat).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At time 0: event1 (given).
- Shortly after: event2 must happen (by ""after event1, event2 must happen"").
- After that: event1 must happen again (by ""after event2, event1 must happen"").
Thus both event1 and event2 do occur.

- C1 (""event2 and event1"") is true because both events occur.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 or event1"") is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is: (C1) OR (event1 happens), where C1 is ""(event2 happens AND event1 happens)"".

Step 2 — examine the context/rules:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- Also, ""after event1, event2 must happen"" — so because event1 happened, event2 will happen afterward.
- Given event2 happens and ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will happen again (but we already have event1 true from the initial fact).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 = (event2 happens AND event1 happens). Both are true (event1 initially true; event2 follows), so C1 is true.
- C2 = C1 OR event1. Since event1 is true (and C1 is also true), the disjunction is true.

Final answer:

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so ""event1 happens"" is true).
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen → given the initial event1, an event2 must occur.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen → ensures event1 will occur again after that event2 (and may continue alternating).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event1, Rule A forces event2 to occur.
- Therefore both event1 (initially) and event2 (later) happen, so C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since event1 happens (and C1 also holds), the disjunction is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. if event2 happens now, then event2 happens in the next state)

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, no future state has any event.)
- Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" but that is irrelevant because event2 never occurs given the previous point.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- The initial (and only) event that happens is event1. After that there are no events at all, so event2 never happens in any reachable state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a conditional. Since event2 never happens, the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is always false; a material implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Therefore C2 holds (true) in this system.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. if event2 happens, then event2 happens in the next state.)

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once the initial event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur in any subsequent state.
- Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is given but irrelevant because event2 never actually occurs given the first rule.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- Because event1 has happened initially and no further events can occur after event1, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a conditional whose antecedent (""event2 happens"") never holds under the given context. A conditional with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Therefore C2 is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time either event1 or event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So the run contains event1 and then stops; event2 does not occur later.
- The ""after event2, no other events can happen"" condition is irrelevant because event2 never occurs here.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Since event1 happened initially, the disjunction in C1 is already true (event1 happened).
- Therefore C1 holds immediately, so ""eventually C1"" (C2) is satisfied (the eventuality is true at the initial point).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial moment, event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur later.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event2 never occurs given the previous point.)

Step 3 — Reason about C1 and C2
- C1 is already true at the initial moment because event1 has happened.
- ""Eventually C1"" is satisfied as soon as C1 is true at some time (including the initial moment). Therefore C2 holds.

Answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the timeline, C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at time 0).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur after time 0).
- The ""after event2, no other events can happen"" clause is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1.

Step 3 — reason about the timeline:
- At the initial time, event1 has happened, so C1 (event2 or event1) is true immediately.
- Therefore C1 holds at some time (the initial time), so ""eventually C1 holds"" is satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., no occurrence of event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point it becomes true that event2 does not happen / from some point on event2 never occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After any event1, event2 must happen → from the initial event1, event2 will occur.
- After any event2, event1 must happen → after that event2, event1 will occur again.
- These rules force an alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (event2 occurs and will continue to occur repeatedly).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false because event2 does occur (immediately after the initial event1).
- Because the alternation continues, event2 keeps occurring, so there is no future point after which event2 never occurs. Thus C1 never becomes true at any future time.

Conclusion:
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces an occurrence of event2 following that initial event1.
- Therefore event2 does happen (so C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" is false).
- Moreover, after event2, event1 must happen and then again event2 must happen, so the events alternate indefinitely; event2 occurs repeatedly.
- Hence C1 never becomes true at any later point, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., at the relevant time, event2 is not occurring / does not occur.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., there is some future point at which C1 is true — some time when event2 does not happen.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event1 has occurred.
- By Rule A, event2 must occur next.
- After that event2, by Rule B, event1 must occur.
- Then by Rule A, event2 must occur again, and so on.
- The system forces an alternating infinite sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false at the initial step (because event2 must happen next) and false at all future steps because event2 occurs repeatedly.
- Therefore there is no future point where C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context gives a concrete trace: initially event2 happens; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no further events occur. So the actual sequence is event2 then event1, and then stop.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" That is true in this trace (it happens initially).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication whose antecedent (C1) is true and whose consequent (""event2 happens"") is also true in the trace. An implication with a true consequent is true, and here the antecedent and consequent refer to the same fact (event2 occurs), so the implication holds.
- Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (a conditional: C1 ⇒ event2 happens)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred, hence C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true.
- The context also forces event1 after event2 and then nothing after event1, but that doesn't prevent the fact that event2 did happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the implication
- The antecedent C1 is true (event2 did occur).
- The consequent ""event2 happens"" is also true (it did happen initially).
- A conditional with a true antecedent and a true consequent is true.

Conclusion
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true — event2 has already occurred.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" C1 already asserts that event2 occurs (eventually), and the context also gives that event2 happened initially, so the consequent ""event2 happens"" is true.
- An implication with a true antecedent and a true consequent is true. (Even vacuously, if the antecedent were false the implication would still be true.)

Therefore C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true (at least at the initial time).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is exactly the content of C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""), so C1 holds as well.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Starting with event2, the rules force event1 to occur, and then event2 again, and so on. Thus event2 does in fact happen (initially and subsequently), and C1 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
C2 is a disjunction: (event2 happens) OR (C1 holds). At least one disjunct is true — in fact both are true — so C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine each condition from the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""Event2 happens"" is true (at least at the initial time).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is exactly the conditional ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens,"" so C1 also holds.
- The rules imply an alternating sequence: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- The disjunction ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" is true if either disjunct is true.
- We have at least one true disjunct: event2 does happen (and in fact C1 also holds).

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., Event2 ∨ C1).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened → Event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen → Event2 → Event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen → Event1 → Event2.
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" → this matches Event1 → Event2, so C1 is true as well.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Event2 is true (already happened), and C1 is also true. Therefore Event2 ∨ C1 is true.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 does occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any trace with event2 includes event1 afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant to C2 except it doesn't prevent event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event2 happened and the rule requires event1 after event2, event1 will eventually happen. That means C1 is true in any trace where event2 happens.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens."" So C2 claims: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will eventually occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 does occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., event1 is guaranteed to follow event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant to whether event1 happens).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happens and the specification says that after event2 event1 must happen, event1 does indeed eventually occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- The antecedent (event2 happens) implies the consequent (event1 eventually happens), so C2 is True.

- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1).

- The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” also directly establishes the implication in C2 for any occurrence of event2.

Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen.
- (After event2 no other events can happen is irrelevant to the truth of C2.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — equivalently ""(event2 does not happen) or (event2 happens).""

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Since event2 does happen, the disjunction (false or true) is true. (Independently, (¬P) ∨ P is a tautology.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 asks whether ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" is true. C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" So C2 is logically: (Event2 does not happen) OR (Event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does happen).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant for truth of C2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
Because event1 happened and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does happen. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false. C2 is the disjunction ""C1 or event2 happens""; since event2 does happen, that disjunction is true (and in any case the disjunction is a tautology).

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the statement ""(Event2 does not happen) OR (Event2 happens)"". We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 does occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to the truth of C2 except confirming event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false, because the context requires event2 to happen.
- C2 is a disjunction: C1 OR event2. Since the context guarantees event2 happens, the second disjunct is true, so C2 is true (a disjunction is true if either disjunct is true).

Step 1 — what’s asked:
You’re asked whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
Context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true in the actual situation. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
C2 is the implication (C1 → event2). Since C1 is false in the actual situation, the implication is vacuously true. (Equivalently, with C1 = ¬E and event2 = E, C2 is (¬E → E), which simplifies to E, and E is true.)

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (i.e., if event2 does not happen, then event2 happens)

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 did happen.
- The other sentences about ""after event2/after event1 no other events can happen"" are irrelevant to whether event2 happened initially.

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- C1 asserts that event2 does not happen. Given the context (event2 happened initially), C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2 (an implication):
- In classical logic, an implication ""If A then B"" is true when A is false (vacuously true).
- Since C1 (the antecedent) is false, the implication C2 is true regardless of the consequent.

Step 1 — identify the question
- You're asking whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and C1
- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the conditional (C1 → event2). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- More concretely: C1 cannot hold given the context, so the conditional is not falsified; thus C2 is true.

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Context facts:
   - Initially, event1 happened (so the initial state already has event1).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

2. Consequence:
   - Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, no other event (including event2) can ever occur in any execution.

3. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false, since event2 can never happen.
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That statement is true (because C1 is false).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not always happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So at the start, event1 has occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Once event1 has happened, no subsequent events are possible.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward (but event1 already occurred initially).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there is no time after the initial moment when event2 can occur.
- There is no indication event2 happened before the initial moment; standard reading treats the initial moment as the start, so event2 cannot have occurred earlier.
- Simultaneous occurrence with the initial event1 is not supported by the statements; even if allowed, ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any event occurring after that initial occurrence, so there is no way to guarantee event2 ""always happens.""

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") cannot hold given the context, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event2) can occur after that initial event1.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur in any timeline. So C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis to evaluate is C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is just a conjunctive repetition of the same fact (i.e., C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"").
- From the context we know event1 happened initially and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so in the given scenario event2 does not in fact occur. That makes the antecedent of C2 false in the actual situation.
- More generally, C2 is the statement p -> (p ∧ p) where p = ""event2 happens"". Logically p -> (p ∧ p) is equivalent to p -> p, which is always true (if p is true then p is true; if p is false the implication is vacuously true).
- Therefore C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to just ""Event2 happens"" (P ∧ P ≡ P).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. P → (P ∧ P).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus event2 does not (and cannot) happen in the given scenario.
- (Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant for this particular evaluation.)

Step 3 — logical analysis of C2:
- The formula P → (P ∧ P) is a logical tautology: if P is true then P ∧ P is true; if P is false the implication is still true. So C2 is true in all cases.
- Concretely here, antecedent (event2 happens) is false in the scenario, so the implication is true; even if the antecedent were true, the consequent would also be true because they are the same proposition.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to simply ""Event2 happens"" (A and A ≡ A).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" So C2 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — simplify
- C2 is the implication P → P (where P = ""event2 happens""), which is a logical tautology (always true).

Step 3 — check context (consistency)
- The context says: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So in the actual scenario event2 does not occur. That makes the antecedent of C2 false, so C2 is also vacuously true in the scenario.

Conclusion
- C2 is True."

Step 1 — what’s being asked
C2 is the claim ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 inevitably occurs following the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C1 and C2
- Because event1 happened initially and the rule forces event2 after event1, event2 does in fact always happen in this scenario. So C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true.
- C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true (and event1 also happened), the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the claim ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., (Event2 always happens) OR (event1 happens)).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So ""event1 happens"" is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So in this execution, event2 will occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the disjunction in C2:
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true.
- The second disjunct, ""event1 happens,"" is true by the given initial fact.

Conclusion:
- Since one disjunct is true, C2 is true.

True

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and components
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true in the actual run.
- Context also implies ""after event1, event2 must happen"" — so in this run event2 will occur, i.e. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true for this scenario as well.
- Even if one ignored the implication about event2, event1 is already true from the initial condition.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction: C1 ∨ event1. Since event1 is true (and C1 is also true by the given rule), the disjunction is true.

We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — what the formulas mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means ""at every point in time, event1 will eventually happen"" (G F event1).

Step 2 — examine the scenario
- Initially event1 happened, so C1 is true at the initial moment.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once that initial event1 occurs the system reaches a state with no further events.
- Therefore there is a state after the initial event1 in whose future no event1 occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- At the state after the initial event1, there is no future occurrence of event1, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1) is false at that state.
- Since C1 fails at that reachable state, ""always C1"" (G F event1) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — interpret as the temporal formula F(event1): at some (current or future) point event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — interpret as G(F(event1)): at every point in time, it is true that event1 will eventually happen (i.e., from every state/event-history, event1 occurs now or later).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial position event1 holds.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is a constraint that only matters if event2 occurs.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means that once event1 has occurred, the system reaches a terminal situation with no further events.

Step 3 — trace the system
- A concrete trace: at time 0 event1 holds (s0). At time 1 and thereafter nothing happens (s1, s2, ...), because after event1 no further events can occur.
- Evaluate C1 = F(event1): true at s0 (event1 just happened). At s1 (and later), there is no future point where event1 occurs again, so F(event1) is false there.
- C2 = G(F(event1)) requires F(event1) to be true at every state. But since F(event1) is false at s1, C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclude
- C1 holds (the initial state satisfies it), but C2 does not hold globally (there is a reachable state after the initial event where C1 is false).

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event1 happens. (a tautological implication)
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds.

Step 2 — understand the context/constraints:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no event can occur after that initial event1 (in particular, event2 does not occur after event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen. This only imposes a requirement if event2 occurs; since event2 does not occur (because event1 already happened and blocks further events), this constraint is irrelevant here.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event1 → event1) is a tautology and therefore holds.
- Event1 is true by the initial fact.
- Therefore the conjunction in C2 (event1 happens AND C1 holds) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (a conditional)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (conjunction)

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1 is a tautological conditional; it holds whenever the implication is interpreted classically (A → A is always true).
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true (it did happen).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event1 happened, the conjunct ""Event1 happens"" in C2 is satisfied.
- C1 holds trivially, so the conjunct ""C1 holds"" is satisfied.
- Other context rules (no events after event1; after event2, event1 must happen) do not contradict that event1 happened initially.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Both parts of C2 are true, so C2 is true.

Final answer:

- C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred at the initial time.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So no event can occur at any time after that initial event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This requires that if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward (i.e., event1 must come after event2).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Event1 has already occurred initially. Because no events may happen after event1, no event (including event2) can occur after that.
- Could event2 have occurred before event1 so that event1 is after event2? No — the scenario states event1 happened initially, so there is no earlier time for event2 to have happened. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time consistent with the constraints.
- Thus ""Event2 happens"" is impossible; while ""event1 happens"" is true.

- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. not (event2 happens and event1 happens)).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur thereafter; therefore event2 cannot occur after event1.
- There is no indication that event2 could have happened before the initial event1; ""initially"" places event1 at the start, so event2 cannot have occurred at any time.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Event1 is true, but event2 does not happen, so C1 (event2 and event1) is false.
- Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
You ask whether C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must also occur subsequently.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
Because event1 already happened initially, there is no time before it for any other event to occur; and no events can happen after it. Thus event2 cannot occur at any time. The implication “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
C1 requires both event2 and event1 to happen. Event1 did happen, but event2 cannot happen, so C1 is false. Therefore C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is true.

Final answer:

Step 1 — identify the question:
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" where C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Thus once event2 has happened, no further events occur.
- (The fact ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 did not happen initially.)

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- Since initially event2 happened, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" applies to the next state, so event1 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- You ask whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Context states: initially event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true.
- C1 is ""event2 does not happen"" — therefore C1 is false (because event2 did happen).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 = (C1) OR (event2 happens) = (false) OR (true) = true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e., ""Event2 does not happen OR event2 happens"")

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
These force event2 to occur (it already did), and then event1 and event2 alternate (so event2 keeps happening).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- Since event2 did happen (initially and thereafter), C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""C1 OR event2 happens"" = false OR true = true.
- (Also as a propositional form, ""not E2 OR E2"" is a tautology, but here we also have the factual occurrence of event2.)

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" So C2 is (not Event2) OR Event2.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- The context states that initially event2 happened. Therefore ""event2 happens"" is true (at least at the initial time).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") contradicts the context, so C1 is False.
- C2 is the disjunction (C1) OR (event2 happens). Since event2 happens (true), the disjunction is True.

- After event2, no other events can happen (so the run terminates immediately after event2).

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions

- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has happened, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- (The statement ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never gets the chance once event2 has happened.)

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- The initial fact is that event2 happened immediately.
- Because event2 occurred and prevents any subsequent events, event1 cannot occur at any point.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2

Sample responses:
1) What is being asked: whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

2) Examine the facts:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 did occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur thereafter.
- There is also the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" but that is irrelevant because event2 does not occur (it cannot occur after event1).

3) Evaluate C1: ""Event1 always happens."" In the given scenario event1 has indeed happened (it is given as initial fact), so C1 holds.

4) Evaluate C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. C1 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 happens.

Final answer: True

First identify the question: is C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") true given the context?

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Trace the sequence:
- Because event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" blocks any further events. So event2 cannot occur.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is not supported by the context: the context only says event1 happened initially, not that it happens at all times or in every possible run. So C1 is not guaranteed.

Since event2 does not happen and C1 does not hold, the disjunction in C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant unless event2 occurs).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, the only event that actually occurs is event1. Event2 cannot occur after event1, and there is no earlier time for event2 (event1 is initial).

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 holds (event1 does happen in the scenario).
- C2 is an “or” statement: (Event2 happens) or (C1 holds). Since C1 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 happens.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (a disjunction: C1 ∨ event1)

Step 2 — understand the context rules:
- Initially (in the current/initial state) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. That means in the next state after the initial one, event1 will occur.
- (Also: after event1, event2 must happen — not needed for this particular conclusion but consistent cyclically.)

Step 3 — apply the rules to C1:
- Since event2 occurred initially and the rule says after event2 event1 must happen, event1 does indeed happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is true.

- (The other rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is consistent but not needed to evaluate C2 here.)

Step 3 — apply the rules:
- Since event2 happened in the current (initial) state, the rule requires event1 to happen in the next state. Hence C1 is true.

Sample responses:
First identify the statements:

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e. in the immediate successor state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future state, its immediate successor has event1).

Use the context:

1. Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state S0 event1 has occurred).
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, there can be no further events in any later states.
3. ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (because no events can happen after event1).

From (1) and (2), no events occur in any state after the initial one. Therefore there is no state whose next state contains event1. C1 is false at the initial state and will never become true, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e. at some state s, the immediate successor s' has event1.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. there exists some future state at which C1 is true — equivalently, at some state the next state has event1.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs, there are no subsequent event occurrences).
- After event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant if event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there can be no further occurrences of any event (neither event1 nor event2) at any later state.
- Therefore there is no state whose next state contains an occurrence of event1. C1 is false at the initial state and at every state.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Since C1 is never true at any state, ""eventually C1"" is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a property of a state: its immediate successor state has event1)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists some future state at which C1 is true, i.e. some state whose next state has event1)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the initial state s0).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events occur in any later state).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (no events can occur after s0), so that requirement is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At s0 event1 has happened.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, no later state (s1, s2, ...) can have any events, in particular none can have event1.
- So there is no state s such that the next state of s contains event1. C1 is false at s0 and at every future state.

Conclusion
- C1 never becomes true at any state, so C2 (""eventually C1"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 asks
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds (i.e. event2 always happens), then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterwards).
- Also: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" (irrelevant here because event2 cannot happen after the initial event1).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- Since event1 happened initially, no further events can occur at all. Therefore event1 happens in every execution (it already occurred at the start).
- Event2 cannot occur in any execution (it cannot occur after the initial event1, and there is no time before the initial state for it to have happened).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The consequent of C2 (""event1 happens"") is true (it happened initially).
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 then event1"" is true. (Even if C1 is false, the implication is true; in fact here event1 is actually true regardless.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 claims: ""If C1 holds (i.e. if event2 always happens), then event1 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so every execution already has event1 at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events can occur after that initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (but since event1 already happened initially and no events can follow it, event2 cannot occur in any execution).

Step 3 — examine C1
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false in the given context: event2 never occurs (it cannot occur after the initial event1), so it is not true that event2 always happens.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The implication ""If C1, then event1"" is either:
  - vacuously true because there are no models/executions in which C1 is true (so there is no counterexample where C1 is true and event1 is false), and/or
  - trivially true anyway because event1 already happens initially in every execution of the context.
- Therefore the conditional statement C2 is true under the given context.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds (i.e. event2 always happens), then event1 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events can occur after that initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — reasoning
- Because event1 already happened initially, the consequent “event1 happens” is true in the given context regardless of whether C1 holds. Therefore the implication “if C1 then event1” is true.
- Independently, even without using the initial fact, the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” yields that any occurrence of event2 forces an occurrence of event1; so if event2 always happens then event1 must happen. That also makes the implication true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (an implication p → p)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 holds at every point in the described scenario.

Step 2 — Examine C1:
- C1 is a tautological implication: any statement of the form p → p is always true (true when p is true, and vacuously true when p is false).

Step 3 — Trace the event sequences given the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so in the actual run event2 never occurs.
- The context also states that if event2 happens then it would be terminal (after event2 no other events can happen), but that only describes consequences if event2 were to occur.

Step 4 — Evaluate ""always holds"":
- At every point in the scenario, C1 is true: where event2 does not happen the implication is vacuously true, and if event2 did happen (in any hypothetical or reachable state) the implication is trivially true as well.
- Therefore C1 holds at all times/points.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (logical form: event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is true in all states given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- The extra statement ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never actually happens.

Step 3 — reason about C1
- C1 is the implication event2 → event2. Any proposition of the form P → P is tautologically true (it is true whenever P is true, and also true when P is false).
- In this system, event2 never happens, so the antecedent is always false; that makes the implication vacuously true at every point. Even if event2 could occur, P→P would still hold.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 is true in every state (tautologically and/or vacuously), C1 always holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the formula p → p (a self-implication).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That asks whether C1 is true in every relevant state (i.e., globally/always).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from the initial state there are no further events (so event2 does not occur in the actual run).
- After event2, no other events can happen → if event2 were to occur, it would be terminal (irrelevant here).

Step 3 — Reasoning about C1:
- The formula p → p is a logical tautology: it is true whenever p is true and also vacuously true when p is false. Thus C1 is true in any state whether event2 occurs there or not.

Step 4 — Does C1 always hold?
- Because C1 is a tautology, it holds in every state of the system (including the actual initial state and any hypothetical states). Therefore C2 is true.

Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens.""

Examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen"" don't contradict the initial occurrence of event2.

Reasoning:
- Because event2 has already occurred initially, ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true.
- C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true (and event2 also happened), the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the claim ""C1 holds or event2 happens.""

Step 2 — Understand C1:
- C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Step 3 — Use the given facts:
- Initially, event2 happened. That means event2 has already occurred.
- Therefore ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true (it occurred at or before now).
- Also the literal clause ""event2 happens"" is true because it did happen.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 is (C1) OR (event2 happens). Both disjuncts are true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. Therefore event2 has occurred already.
- From that, C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is satisfied (event2 has happened, so it does eventually happen).
- C2 is the disjunction: C1 holds OR event2 happens.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction C2 is true (a disjunction is true if either disjunct is true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and C1
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" That is just the same proposition repeated, so C1 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""

Step 3 — trace events
- Initially event1 happened.
- The premises say: after event1, no other events can happen. So in the actual scenario event2 does not (and cannot) occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (since C1 ≡ event2). This is a logical tautology: any statement implies itself.
- Also, in the material-implication sense, an implication with a false antecedent is true. Here the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is false in the actual scenario, so the implication is true as well.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" (equivalent to ""Event2 happens"").
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (so C2 is the implication: event2 → C1).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore, once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur.
- (Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is given but irrelevant since event2 does not actually occur here.)

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- C1 is equivalent to event2 (p ∧ p ≡ p), so C2 is p → p, which is a logical tautology.
- Concretely, because event2 does not occur (its antecedent is false), the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step-by-step:

1. Context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So in the actual history/event trace, event2 does not happen.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". Given the context, C1 is false.

3. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is the implication P → (P ∧ P) with P = ""event2 happens"". P ∧ P is equivalent to P, so this is P → P, which is a tautology. Also, since event2 does not happen here the antecedent is false, making the implication vacuously true.

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (C1 = ""event1 happens and event2 happens"".)

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur (neither afterwards nor before, because event1 is initial).
- Therefore C1 (""event1 and event2"") is false in this context.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication (event1 ∧ event2) → event2. That implication is logically valid: whenever the antecedent holds it already includes event2, and if the antecedent is false the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is the claim ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" (E1 ∧ E2).
- C2 is the claim ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"" ((E1 ∧ E2) ⇒ E2).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur after event1.
- Thus C1 (E1 ∧ E2) is in fact impossible in this context (its antecedent E1 is true but E2 cannot be true afterward).

Step 3 — logical relation:
- The implication (E1 ∧ E2) ⇒ E2 is a logical tautology (conjunction elimination): if both E1 and E2 hold, then E2 holds.
- Even if C1 is false in the given context, a material implication with a false antecedent is still true (vacuous truth).

Conclusion:
C2 is True.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether this conditional is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events—including event2—can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Not needed here but consistent.)

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 asserts: event1 happens and event2 happens. Given the context, event1 did happen and no events can occur afterward, so event2 cannot happen. Therefore C1 is false in this scenario (it cannot be satisfied).
- C2 is the conditional ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is either:
  - trivially true as a logical fact (from C1 = event1 ∧ event2, the consequent event2 is part of the antecedent), or
  - vacuously true because the antecedent C1 is false in the given situation (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 says: ""If event1 does not happen (C1), then event2 happens."" We must decide whether that conditional follows from the given context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred in the actual timeline.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterward.
- Also, ""After event1, event2 must happen"" ensures that if event1 ever occurred, event2 would follow — but given the initial event2 and the terminal nature of event2, event1 cannot occur after that.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- In every possible timeline consistent with the context, event2 occurs (it occurs initially).
- Therefore in every such timeline, if event1 does not happen, event2 still happens (since event2 already happened).

Conclusion:
- The implication ""if event1 does not happen, then event2 happens"" is true under the context.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must evaluate C2: ""If C1 holds (event1 does not happen), then event2 happens."" Determine whether that conditional is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true (it occurred).
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Irrelevant for the truth of the implication if event2 already happened.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means event1 cannot occur after the initial event2; it could only have occurred before, but there's no information that it did.

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- An implication ""If C1 then event2"" is true whenever the consequent (event2) is true. Since event2 did happen initially, the consequent is true in the given scenario.
- Therefore, regardless of whether C1 holds, the conditional C2 is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" We must determine whether that conditional is true given the context.

Examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true in the initial state (and thus true in every allowed run).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This would force event2 after event1, but is redundant here because event2 already happened initially.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 happened initially, no events can occur afterward, so event1 cannot occur later.

Trace the possible sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can happen after it, event1 does not happen. So C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") holds.
- Event2 has in fact happened (initially).

Evaluate C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens""):
- In the only possible situation consistent with the context, C1 is true and event2 is true. There is no allowed scenario where C1 holds and event2 does not happen (initial event2 is given). Therefore the conditional is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — setup
- Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no future occurrences of event1 or event2).
- Rule: if event1 happens then event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur).

Step 2 — evaluate C1 in the next state
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" evaluated at the next state s1.
- Since event2 happened in s0 and no events can happen after event2, s1 has no occurrences of event1 or event2.
- Therefore C1 is false in s1.

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (any state after event2 has no events occurring).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs then event2 must occur afterwards).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
- The initial state has event2. Because after event2 no other events can happen, the next state (and all subsequent states) have no events occurring.
- Therefore in the next state neither event1 nor event2 happens.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 in the next state would require event1 or event2 to happen there. Neither happens in the next state, so C1 is false in the next state.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must decide if, given the context, C1 (event1 happens or event2 happens) is true in the next state.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial state event2 occurs (C1 is true at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means at any later state (including the next state) neither event1 nor event2 can occur.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" only constrains runs where event1 occurs; it doesn't create any new events here.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Since event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, in the next state there are no occurrences of event1 or event2.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens"". In the next state neither happens, so C1 is false in the next state. Therefore C2 is False.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1:
C1 asserts ""Event1 happens in the next state."" But because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, there is no next event; in particular event1 cannot occur in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:
C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds OR event2 happens."" Although C1 is false, event2 does happen (it happened initially). Therefore the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the current/initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no subsequent events).
- (Also: after event1, event2 must happen — not needed here because event1 cannot occur after event2.)

Step 3 — reason through sequences:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false.
- However, event2 has already happened in the initial state, so the disjunct ""event2 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 = C1 OR event2 happens = false OR true = true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 already happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, there are no further events in any subsequent state.
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen (but this won’t come into play because event1 cannot occur after event2).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given that event2 has already happened and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" The disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Although C1 is false, event2 has already happened (initially), so the second disjunct is true.

- C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- C1 is: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

So C2 is the implication: (event1 happens in the next state) → (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 already occurred in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore there are no further events in any next state; in particular, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false in the given context.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- (Also note: if C1 were true, it would directly imply event1 happens, so the implication would hold anyway.)

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e. C1 ⇒ event1)

Step 2 — examine context:
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 occurred in the current/initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no events (including event1) can occur in the next state.
- (The ""after event2..."" clause is irrelevant here.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- Since no events can occur after event1, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- The implication C1 ⇒ event1 has a false antecedent (C1 is false), so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true now).
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any subsequent state.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the context, after event1 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot happen in any later state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication is true whenever its antecedent is false (vacuous truth). Also, independently, event1 already happened initially, so the consequent is true now as well.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because the antecedent C1 is false, the implication C2 is vacuously true (and the consequent is in fact true already). Therefore C2 is True.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. ""Event2 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (current state).
- The rules force alternation: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At the initial state event1 happened.
- By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", the next state must have event2.
- Therefore in the next state, event2 holds, so C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens"" (a proposition about a state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately following the initial state, either event1 or event2 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially (current state S0): event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs in some state, then event2 must occur in the following state).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs in some state, then event1 must occur in the following state).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- S0: event2 (given).
- By Rule B, immediately after S0 (in S1) event1 must happen.
- Thus S1: event1 holds (and hence ""event1 or event2"" holds in S1).
- The sequence continues alternating (S2: event2, S3: event1, ...), but we only need S1.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is true in the next state S1 (because event1 holds there), so C2 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the proposition “event1 happens or event2 happens.”
- C2 says “C1 holds in the next state” (i.e., in the state immediately following the current one).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event2 has happened (so C1 is true now).
- “After event2, event1 must happen” and “After event1, event2 must happen” force the events to alternate: every time one happens, the other must occur next.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event2 has happened.
- By the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” the next state must have event1.
- In that next state event1 happens, so “event1 or event2 happens” (C1) is true there.

Conclusion
C2 is True.
---
Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event2 occurred (state 0).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 in the next state (state 1).
- C1 is ""event1 or event2"". Since event1 holds in state 1, C1 holds in the next state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:

- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"", i.e. ""If event2 happens then event2 happens"" (p → p).

Step 2 — Examine C2:
- The implication p → p is a tautology (always true) in classical logic — it holds regardless of whether p is actually true or false.

Step 3 — Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same proposition repeated, so C1 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Substituting C1, C2 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context gives: initially event2 happened; and rules that after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen. Those rules produce an alternating requirement, but they don't change the logical form of C2.

Step 3 — logical reasoning
- The implication ""If event2 happens then event2 happens"" is a logical tautology (P → P is always true).
- Also, since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true in the given context; but even without using that fact, C2 is true by tautology.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" So C2 is the implication C1 → event2.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So event2 occurs initially and the rules force alternating occurrences of event1 and event2 thereafter.

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- C1 (equivalent to ""event2 happens"") is true because event2 happened initially (and continues to occur later as well).
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event2."" Since C1 is equivalent to event2, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 → event2"", which is a tautology (and in the actual situation the antecedent and consequent are true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (so at the current/initial state we have event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after any state with event2 must have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so states alternate event2 → event1 → event2 → ...).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At the initial state we have event2.
- By the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” the immediate next state must have event1. Thus C1 is true at the initial moment (the next state contains event1).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 is already true (holds in the next state), ""eventually C1"" is also true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what is asked:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the immediate successor of the current state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future point where C1 is true).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the current/initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so immediately following any state where event2 occurred, the next state must have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (they alternate).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At the initial state (time 0) event2 occurred.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" at the next state (time 1) event1 must occur. Thus C1 is true right away at the initial state.
- Since C1 holds now, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied (in fact immediately).

Conclusion: True

Step 1 — what is asked:
C2 states ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — apply the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" therefore forces event1 to occur in the next state after the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:

- If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" is true (it already holds).

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 states ""Event2 always happens."" At the initial state this is true because event2 already happened.
- C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state.
- But the context says ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — so from the next state onward there is no possibility for event2 to occur (it occurred only before).
- Therefore from the next state you cannot guarantee that ""event2 always happens"" (there are no futures from that state that include event2), so C1 does not hold there.

Hence C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C2 asserts that ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. the next-state operator X C1).

Step 2 — given conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen → there is no next state after the initial state.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 did not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is true along the current (finite) trace because the only state has event2.
- But C2 requires that C1 hold in the next state. There is no next state (execution terminates), and under standard next-state semantics Xφ is false when no next state exists.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 asserts that ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is ""Event2 always happens."" So C2 asks: in the state immediately after the initial state, does the property ""event2 always happens"" hold?

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once we move to the next state, no occurrences of event1 or event2 happen there or afterwards).
- The ""after event1, event2 must happen"" constraint is irrelevant because event1 never occurs (event2 already occurred first and blocks further events).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
The only event that occurs is event2 in the initial state; thereafter there are no events.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") would require event2 to hold at every state from the point of evaluation onward. That fails in the next state because no events (in particular no event2) occur there.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (formally: event1 → event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., globally/at every point, event1 → event1).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about event sequences
- Because event1 happens initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no further events (including event2) can occur after the initial event1.
- The clause ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in any reachable sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is the tautology p → p, which is always true in standard logic (true at any state whether p holds or not).
- Therefore C1 holds at every state; so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (a conditional with the same antecedent and consequent)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true in all situations/times)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about C1
- C1 is a tautological implication: whenever event1 occurs, the consequent ""event1 happens"" is the same as the antecedent, so the implication is true in every possible case. There is no scenario in which ""event1 happens"" is true and simultaneously ""event1 happens"" is false.

Step 4 — consider whether any context condition could falsify C1
- The context constraints do not produce a situation where C1 would fail. Even if event1 is terminal or required after event2, that doesn't create a counterexample to the tautology.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in all cases, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- C1 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (a material implication event1 → event1).
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., C1 is true in every state/time).

Step 2 — Examine C1
- A material implication p → p is a logical tautology: it is true in every state because it can only be false if p is true and p is false simultaneously, which is impossible.
- So C1 is true in any state, regardless of the event dynamics.

Step 3 — Consider the context and possible states
- The context (initial event1; after event2 must have event1; after event1 no further events) does not introduce any state in which event1 → event1 would be false.
- Thus there is no reachable state that falsifies C1.

Conclusion
- Because C1 is a tautology and holds in every state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's being asked
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (i.e., event2 eventually happens OR event1 happens).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true (it already occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen — therefore no future event (including event2) can occur after that initial event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, and event1 has already occurred.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction: (event2 eventually happens) OR (event1 happens).
- Since event1 already happened initially, the second disjunct is true, so the whole disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 ever happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (i.e., event2 eventually happens OR event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- C1 is false (event2 cannot happen because no events can occur after the initial event1).
- ""event1 happens"" is true (it happened initially).
- Therefore C2 = (false) OR (true) = true.

True
---
Step 1 — identify facts:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur given the previous point).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. Given event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after that, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens. This is a disjunction; since event1 happens (true), the disjunction is true regardless of C1.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event1 does not happen."" So C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 does happen.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- The context states explicitly: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did happen.
- (For completeness: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 nothing else can happen.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Since event1 did happen, C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true or false.
- C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 already happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means no events occur in any successor state of the initial state.
- The clause about event2 is irrelevant because event2 is not said to occur.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 requires that in the next state (a successor state) event1 happens there.
- But by the given rule, after event1 no events can happen in successor states, so event1 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false at the initial state, and since no events ever occur after the initial state, C1 will never become true later.

Conclusion:
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" — i.e. at the immediate successor of the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — i.e. at some future state (possibly the next one) C1 is true.

Step 2 —inspect the given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means there are no further events/transitions after the initial state — there is no successor state in which any event (including event1 again) can occur.
- (The clause about event2 is irrelevant because event2 does not occur initially and cannot occur after itself either.)

Step 3 —trace possible event sequences
- From the initial state there is no next state (no further events/transitions are possible).

Step 4 —evaluate C1 and then C2
- C1 requires a next state where event1 happens. There is no next state, so C1 is false.
- C2 requires that C1 becomes true at some future state. Because there are no future states, C1 can never become true, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False

- After event1, no other events can happen. (Thus no events occur in any state following the initial one.)
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- The initial state has event1. In every state after that, no events occur.
- For C1 to hold at some state s, event1 must occur in s's next state. But no events occur in any state after the initial one, so event1 never occurs in any next state.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- There is no state where C1 is true, so C1 never eventually holds.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — restate the facts
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred at the initial/current state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no events occur in any later state).
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen — irrelevant here because event2 did not occur.)

Step 3 — unpack the hypotheses
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” This asserts that in the state immediately after the current one, event1 occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That says that in the next state, C1 is true — i.e. event1 happens in the state after the next (two steps from now).

Step 4 — reason about possibilities
- Since event1 already happened and the rule says that after event1 no events can happen, no events can occur in any subsequent state. Therefore event1 does not happen in the next state (C1 is false) and it does not happen in the state after the next either (so C1 is false when evaluated at the next state).

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., ""Event1 happens in the state two steps ahead."")

Step 2 — Use the context:
- Initially, event1 has happened (so the current/initial state already has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus no events (including event1 again) can occur in any future state after the initial one.

Step 3 — Evaluate:
- C1 (event1 in the next state) is false, because no events can occur after the initial state.
- C2 asserts that C1 is true in the next state (which would mean event1 occurs two steps ahead). That is also impossible given ""no other events can happen"" after event1.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify what’s asked
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (Evaluated at the initial state S0: this asserts event1 occurs in S1.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (At S0 this asserts that in S1 the formula C1 is true, i.e. that event1 happens in S2.)

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially (in S0) event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has happened (as in S0), no events can occur in any later states (S1, S2, ...).
- The rule about event2 is irrelevant because event2 does not occur here.

Step 3 — Reason through sequences
- Because no events can occur after the initial event1, event1 cannot occur in S1. So C1 (event1 in S1) is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in S1, i.e. that event1 occurs in S2. But no events can happen after the initial event1, so event1 cannot occur in S2 either. Therefore C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 asserts that C1 (""Event2 happens or event1 happens"") is true in the next state. We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the current state event1 has occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has happened the system is terminal — no further events occur in subsequent states.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.

Step 3 — trace to the next state
Because event1 has already happened and no events can happen afterward, in the next state there are no event occurrences. Thus neither event2 nor a new occurrence of event1 happens in the next state.

Step 4 — conclusion
C1 (""event2 happens or event1 happens"") does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C2 asks:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. Next( event2 ∨ event1 ).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the current/initial state event1 occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has happened, there are no further events.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 occurs; but event2 cannot occur after event1 because no events can occur after event1.

Step 3 — trace to the next state:
- Since event1 already happened and it forbids any subsequent events, in the next state neither event2 nor event1 happens.

Conclusion:
- In the next state, (event2 or event1) is false, so C1 does not hold there.
- Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (holds in a given state if at least one of those events occurs in that state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so in the initial state event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so any state following a state where event1 occurred has no events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the other rules.

Step 3 — trace to the next state:
- From the initial state (where event1 happened), the next state has no events (by ""after event1, no other events can happen"").
- Therefore in the next state neither event1 nor event2 happens, so C1 is false in that next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 → event1.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 → event2.)
Thus an occurrence of event2 forces event1 to occur afterward.

Step 3 — examine the hypothesis
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 does not happen (i.e., event2 → C1).

Step 4 — trace and reason
- Event2 did happen initially, so by the context rule, event1 must happen afterward. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 requires that when event2 happens, C1 is true. But event2 does happen and C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then event1 does not happen."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (at least once after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen, and the cycle continues.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false, because the rules force event1 to happen after the initial event2.
- C2 is an implication: antecedent = ""event2 happens"" (true, since event2 did happen), consequent = C1 (""event1 does not happen"") (false). An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Plan: restate what C2 says, examine given rules, follow events, check the implication.

1) What C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event1 does not happen."" So C2 is the claim: event2 ⇒ (event1 does not happen).

2) Use the context rules:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs afterwards.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (They alternate.)

3) Trace the actual sequence starting from the initial fact:
- Initially event2 happened (antecedent of C2 is true).
- By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 does happen. Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false in this scenario.

4) Evaluate C2 (an implication): an implication is false if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. Here antecedent (event2 happens) is true and consequent (event1 does not happen) is false. So C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked
You are asked whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true or false. C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreting C2 in the natural way used here: ""there is some future point from which C1 holds"" — i.e. eventually Event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — Given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs next).
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs next).
These rules force events to alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — Trace and reason
Starting with the initial event1, event2 must occur next. Once event2 has occurred, event1 must occur after it, and then event2 must occur again, and so on. Thus event2 will occur (in fact infinitely often) and never permanently stops happening.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C1 and C2
C1 (""Event2 does not happen"" in the sense ""event2 never occurs from some point onward"") cannot become true, because event2 must occur repeatedly. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point it becomes true that Event2 does not happen (equivalently, Event2 never happens from that point on).
The question: is C2 true or false?

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially Event1 happened.
- The rule ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"" means that because Event1 happened initially, Event2 is required to occur at some future time.
- The rule ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"" just enforces alternation afterward.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Since Event1 already occurred initially and the rule requires Event2 to occur after Event1, Event2 will occur. Therefore the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false and cannot become true at any future time.
- Because C1 cannot become true, the claim ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (read as a global claim that Event2 never occurs).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some future point the claim C1 becomes true (equivalently, from that point onward Event2 never happens).

2. Examine the context:
   - Initially Event1 happened.
   - After Event1, Event2 must happen (so Event2 will occur).
   - After Event2, Event1 must happen (so they alternate and will keep occurring).

3. Trace the sequence:
   - Because Event1 occurred initially, the rule forces Event2 to occur.
   - After Event2 occurs, Event1 must occur again, and then Event2 again, and so on — Event2 will occur (indeed infinitely often).

4. Conclusion:
   - C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false given the rules.
   - Therefore C1 cannot ""eventually hold"" at any future point, so C2 is false.

So the final answer is False."

- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did happen.
- The other sentences (""After event2..."" and ""After event1..."") don't change that event1 happened initially.

The context explicitly states ""Initially, event1 happened."" Therefore event1 did happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:  
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") contradicts the context, so C1 is false.  
- C2 is the statement that C1 does not hold; since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e. event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there is some point in time at which C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The formula A → A is a tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether A (here, event2) actually occurs. So C1 is true at every point in time.

Step 3 — apply to C2:
- Since C1 is true always (in particular at some time), ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Step 4 — check consistency with the context:
- The context (initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no further events) does not conflict with C1, and does not affect the tautological truth of C1.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True or False.
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is the formula p -> p (with p = ""event2 happens"").
- p -> p is a propositional tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether p holds.

Step 3 — relate C1 to the scenario:
- Because C1 is true in every state (including the initial state), it already holds now.
- Therefore C1 certainly ""eventually holds"" (indeed, it holds immediately).

Conclusion:
True
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (a self-implication)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — i.e. at some point in the timeline C1 is true.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Trace possible events:
- At the initial moment event2 already happened.
- By the second rule, event1 must then occur.
- After event1 nothing else happens. So the timeline is: event2 (initial) → event1 → stop.

Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is a tautology (P → P). It is true at any moment whether or not event2 occurs; in particular it is true at the initial moment when event2 happened.
- Since C1 already holds now, it certainly holds at some time in the timeline — therefore ""eventually C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means once that initial event1 occurs, no subsequent events are possible.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- There is no indication that event2 could have occurred before the initial state, so in all allowed timelines consistent with the given facts and rules, event2 never happens.
- Thus C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") holds in every allowed case, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context: Initially event1 happened.
2. Context: “After event1, no other events can happen.” Since event1 already happened initially, that forbids any event from occurring at any later time.
3. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial moment. There is no prior time before “initially” for events to have happened, so event2 cannot occur at all.
4. Hence C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.
5. C2 states that C1 always holds. Because event2 cannot occur at any time (given the context), C1 indeed holds always.

Thus C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" i.e. ""Event2 never happens (in any trace).""
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (At the start/event 0, event1 has occurred.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterwards.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal — once it occurs, no further events may occur.)

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- Because event1 occurs initially, we are already in a state after event1. The rule “after event1, no other events can happen” therefore forbids any event from occurring after that initial point — in particular, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No: “initially event1 happened” places event1 at the start of the trace, so there is no earlier time for event2 to occur.
- The clause “after event2, event1 must happen” doesn’t create a way to allow event2; it only constrains traces where event2 occurs, but such traces are incompatible with the other statements (because event1 already happened initially and prevents further events).

Step 4 — conclusion
- There is no possible trace where event2 occurs. Therefore C1 holds in every trace, so C2 (“C1 always holds”) is True.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine the hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this just asserts event2 happens (redundant phrasing).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"", C2 is also equivalent to ""event2 happens"".

Step 4 — trace the events:
The context says event2 did happen initially, so the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true (and thus C1 is true). Therefore C2, which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"", is also true. The other constraints (that event1 must follow and then nothing else can happen) do not negate event2 happening.

Reasoning:

- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 occurs, no further events may occur after it.)

Step 2 — what C1 and C2 say
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (Both events occur in that same state.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (In the state immediately after the current one, both event2 and event1 occur.)

Step 3 — reason about possible next-state events
- Because initially event2 has already happened, Rule B forbids any other events from happening after that. Therefore in the next state no events can occur (in particular, event1 cannot occur there).
- Since event1 cannot occur in the next state, the conjunction in C1 cannot hold in the next state.

Conclusion
C2 is False.

False

Reasoning:
1. Initially event2 happened.
2. The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means no events (so in particular event1) can occur after that initial event2.
3. Therefore there is no state in which both event2 and event1 have occurred (event1 cannot occur at any later time, and there is no earlier time than the initial one).
4. So C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is false.
5. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. There is no next state (no events/transitions are allowed after the initial event2), so C2 is false."

- After event1, event2 must happen. (So from the initial situation, event2 is required to occur at some point.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2, when it occurs, is terminal.)

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- Because event1 has happened initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" any allowed evolution of the system must include event2 at some future point.
- Therefore the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false in any permitted evolution that respects the given constraints.

Let's restate:

- Given: Initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen.

Hypothesis parts:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state, event2 does not happen).

Reasoning:
- From Rule A and the fact event1 has happened, event2 must happen after event1; therefore event2 does happen. So C1 is false.
- C2 claims C1 is true in the next state. Since C1 is false (event2 must occur), C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C2 asserts that ""C1 (Event2 does not happen) holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the premises:
- Initially event1 has happened (we are in a state after event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in every allowed continuation, event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") contradicts the premise that after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore C1 is false in the current state (and in every reachable state prior to event2).
- Since event2 must happen after event1, the next state cannot make ""Event2 does not happen"" true. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state.

C2 is False."

Sample responses:

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at all times, event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the context/conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So at the initial moment event2 has occurred.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Once event2 occurs, event1 must occur later.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Once event1 occurs, event2 must occur later.)

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (at least once) after that initial event2.
- Once event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur again.
- Thus event2 has already occurred (initially) and will occur again; it is not the case that event2 never happens.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false because event2 did happen initially.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false as well.

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"", where C1 = ""Event2 does not happen"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — interpret C2:
- C2 says: at all times, Event2 does not happen (i.e., Event2 never happens).

Step 2 — check the given conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened. That directly contradicts C1 (which asserts Event2 does not happen).
- Also, the rules ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"" and ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"" force Event1 and Event2 to alternate, so Event2 will occur repeatedly after the initial occurrence.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Because Event2 already happened initially, C1 is false at that time, so C1 cannot ""always hold.""
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event2 never happens at any time).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment, event2 did occur.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 forces a later event2).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 forces a later event1).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event2 happened initially, Rule B requires event1 to happen afterward.
- That event1 then triggers Rule A, so event2 must happen again, and so on — event2 occurs at least initially and then repeatedly.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is already false at the initial moment (since event2 did happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false as well — C1 does not hold even once, so it cannot hold always.

- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 already happens).
- After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. This yields at least the sequence event2 → event1 → event2 → …, so both events occur (starting with event2).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because event2 (indeed) happens.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither Event2 nor Event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- Also: after Event1, Event2 must happen; after Event2, Event1 must happen. (This implies at least one of the two events occurs and they alternate, but we only need the initial fact.)

Step 3 — trace reasoning:
- Because Event2 happened initially, the disjunction in C1 (Event2 or Event1) is true.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as: at all future points (globally) event2 holds.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — interpreted as: there exists some future time after which C1 is true (i.e., from that time onward event2 always holds).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 occurs at time 0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so because event2 happened initially, event1 will occur at some later time).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequence
- Time 0: event2 occurs (by ""initially"").
- Sometime after that, event1 must occur (by ""after event2, event1 must happen"").
- Once event1 occurs, no further events can occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false: after event1 occurs there are no events, so event2 does not hold at all future points.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") would require a future time after which event2 holds at all times. But because event1 must occur after the initial event2 and that makes all events stop, there is no suffix of the run where event2 holds forever. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpretations:
   - C1 (""Event2 always happens"") means: from a given point onward, at every moment/event occurrence event2 holds (i.e. ""always event2"").
   - C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") means: there is some future point after which C1 is true (i.e. from that point onward event2 holds at all times).

2. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur after the initial event2.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3. Trace of events allowed by the constraints:
   - The only possible sequence is: event2 (initial), then event1, then termination (no further events).

4. Check C1:
   - C1 would require event2 to hold at every future point. But event1 occurs (and after that no events occur), so there are times/points where event2 does not hold. Therefore C1 is false at all times.

5. Check C2:
   - C2 would require that at some point we reach a state from which event2 holds always. There is no such point in the only possible sequence (event1 occurs and prevents further event2), so C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — meaning of the claims
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): interpreted as “from some point onward at every step/event, event2 holds” (i.e. G(event2) or “event2 holds at all future times”).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds""): interpreted as “there is some time after which C1 is true forever” (i.e. F(G(event2))).

Step 2 — use the context constraints
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so an event1 will occur at some later time).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event2 happens initially, the rule forces that event1 will happen later.
- Once event1 happens, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- Therefore there is a point (when event1 has occurred) after which event2 does not happen at all. Thus there cannot be any suffix of the execution in which event2 holds at every future time.

Conclusion
- C1 is not true globally, and there cannot be a time after which C1 holds forever. Therefore C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when (event2 eventually happens) AND (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is a conditional: if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur later. But since event1 already occurred initially and that prevents any later events, event2 cannot occur afterward; and there is no earlier time before the initial state for event2 to have happened.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- Event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 because no events can happen after event1.
- There is no earlier time for event2 to have occurred (initial event1 is at the start), so event2 never happens.

Step 4 — conclude about the hypothesis:
- C1 is false (event2 does not eventually happen).
- event1 is true, but C2 requires C1 as well, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when event2 eventually happens AND event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur thereafter.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant for enabling event2 here (it only constrains that if event2 occurs, event1 must follow).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Since event1 happened initially, no events can occur after that. Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have happened before event1? No, because event1 happened initially (at the start), so there was no time before it for event2.

Hence event2 cannot happen at any time, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires C1 (false) AND event1 (true). False AND True = False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — parse the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So the system starts in a state where event1 has already occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, that forces event1 after it.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal: no events can occur after it.)

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no possibility for event2 to occur at any later time. (There is no allowed history where event2 occurs after the initial event1.)
- Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires both C1 and that event1 happens. Event1 does happen (true), but C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" (where C1 = ""Event2 always happens"").

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Context says: initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So because event2 occurred, event1 must occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant for the disjunction except that it doesn't prevent event1).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not supported by the context (we only know event2 happened initially), so we cannot conclude C1 holds.
- However, because event2 did happen and after event2 event1 must happen, event1 does happen.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- C2 is true if either event1 happens or C1 holds. We have established event1 happens, so the disjunction is true.

- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (Not needed to be true for C2.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 3 — trace the events:
- Since event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur.
- Once event1 occurs, the disjunction in C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is satisfied regardless of whether C1 is true.

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is simply equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- Therefore C2 requires that event1 happens (C1) and event1 happens — i.e., C2 is true exactly when event1 happens.

Step 3 — use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred (which is the initial state), no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Event1 does not occur (it cannot occur after the initial event2), so C1 is false and thus C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (since C1 is the same).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — trace possible events
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot happen at any time.

Step 4 — conclude
- Since event1 does not happen, C1 is false and therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C2 is True or False.

1) Identify hypothesis: C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"". So C2 ≡ (Event1 happens) AND (Event1 does not happen).

2) Examine context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

From ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" we infer event1 does not occur (it cannot happen after event2, and there is no earlier time given when it could have happened). So C1 is true.

3) But C2 requires both that Event1 happens and that Event1 does not happen simultaneously. That is a direct contradiction; a statement and its negation cannot both be true.

Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions

- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant since event1 never gets the chance if event2 already occurred.)

Step 3 — Reason about events
- Since event2 happened initially and it prevents any further events, event1 cannot happen.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 requires event1 to happen and C1 to hold simultaneously; but event1 does not happen, so C2 is false.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all states/traces, event2 never happens.
You are asked whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the initial moment, event2 has occurred.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So the trace stops after that initial event2.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (Irrelevant here, because event1 cannot occur after event2; but it doesn’t negate the initial occurrence of event2.)

Step 3 — trace and reasoning
- Because event2 happens initially, the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false in the initial state.
- If C1 is false at the initial state, then it cannot ""always hold."" Therefore C2 is false.

- The other rules (""after event2 no other events can happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"") do not make C1 true at the initial state; they only constrain future possibilities.

- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e. event2 → event1 eventually happens).

- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (This prevents event2 from occurring after event1, so both cannot occur one after the other.)

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no further events can happen, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- Could event1 have happened before event2? If event1 had happened earlier, then ""after event1 no other events can happen"" would prevent event2, contradicting that event2 did happen. So event1 did not happen before event2 either.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 is false (event1 does not eventually happen).
- The antecedent of C2 (event2 happens) is true.
- A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.

Final answer: False

- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 will eventually occur).

- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterwards).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs in the given initial trace).

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Because event2 happened initially and it prevents any further events, event1 does not (and cannot) eventually happen. Therefore C1 is false in the actual scenario.
- C2 claims that whenever event2 happens, C1 holds. We have a case where event2 happens but C1 does not; that is a counterexample to C2.

- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This just says event1 would also be terminal, but doesn't force it to occur.)

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false in this scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 says: if event2 happens, then event1 eventually happens.
- In our situation event2 does happen, but event1 does not. That makes the implication false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to (not Event2) AND (Event2).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- Also, ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant for proving C2; it only constrains sequences if event2 were to occur.

Step 3 — reason about conditions:
- C2 requires both that event2 does not happen and that event2 does happen simultaneously — a direct contradiction.
- From the context we also infer event2 cannot happen (so C1 is true), but that doesn't make the conjugate ""and event2 happens"" true.

Conclusion:
C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 asserts the conjunction: (C1) ""Event2 does not happen"" AND ""event2 happens"". We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context rules
- Initially, event1 happened.
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward.
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" prevents any further events, so event2 cannot occur later.
- There is no temporal room for event2 to have happened before the initial event1 (the statement says event1 happened initially), so the only consistent conclusion is that event2 does not happen. Thus C1 is true.
- C2 requires both ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens"" simultaneously, which is a contradiction and cannot be satisfied.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- It asks whether C2 is true, where C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens), and C1 is ""event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- C1: event2 does not happen.
- C2: (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens) — a direct contradiction.

Step 3 — trace events with the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — since event1 happened initially, no event (including event2) can ever happen afterward.
- Therefore event2 does not happen, so C1 is true.
- But C2 requires event2 to both not happen and happen simultaneously, which is impossible.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no event can occur after that initial event1.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant unless event2 occurs.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Event2 does not happen (it cannot occur after the initial event1). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C1 is true (vacuously).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts: if C1 holds (which it does), then event2 happens. The antecedent is true, but event2 does not happen, so the conditional is false.

Final answer
False

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no other events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen in any actual sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"") is true: the antecedent never occurs (and in fact event1 did happen initially), so the implication holds.
- C2 (""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"") asserts that from C1 being true we can conclude event2 happens. But C1 does hold while event2 does not happen (and cannot happen). So C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant since event2 won't occur).

Step 2 — can event2 happen?
- Because event1 happened initially and it prevents any subsequent events, event2 cannot occur at any time. So event2 is false (does not happen).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 does not happen, C1 is vacuously true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" C1 does hold (true), but event2 does not happen (false). So the implication C1 -> event2 is false.

Sample responses:
Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens.
The question: is C2 true or false?

Examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So there is at least one occurrence of event2 already.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So any occurrence of event2 forces a subsequent event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So any event1 forces a subsequent event2, and the two will alternate.

Trace the sequence:
- Since event2 happened initially, C1 is satisfied (event2 does happen).
- Given an occurrence of event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees that event1 will happen after that event2.
- Even if ""eventually"" were interpreted to mean strictly after now, the alternation rule (event1→event2→event1→...) ensures event2 will occur again and thus still triggers an event1.

Conclusion:
- If C1 holds (and it does), event1 must happen. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer:
True

Summary of the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""

What we know:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event2, event1 must happen.
- After any event1, event2 must happen.

Reasoning (concise):
- Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is satisfied.
- Given the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" the occurrence of event2 (whether initial or eventual) guarantees that event1 will happen afterward.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds (event2 eventually happens), then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially, by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will happen.
- After that event1, by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will happen again, and the alternation continues.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 (event2 eventually happens) is true (it already happened initially and will happen again).
- Given the rules, whenever event2 happens, event1 must follow. So if C1 holds, event1 does indeed happen.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Let's unpack the statements and their consequences.

1. Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.
2. After event2, no other events can happen — so the initial state is terminal (it has no successor).
3. After event1, no other events can happen — any state where event1 occurs would also be terminal.

C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the initial state already has event2 (not event1) and no further events can occur, event1 does not happen at all in the system. So C1 is false in the initial state (event1 is not happening, let alone ""always"" happening).

C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so there is no state in which to evaluate C1. Therefore C2 is not true.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step‑by‑step:

- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. at every state from that point onward).
- The context says initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So once we are at the initial state (where event2 occurred) there can be no occurrence of event1 later.
- Therefore event1 does not hold at every state (it does not occur in the next state or any future state), so C1 is false at the initial state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. In the next state there are still no events (because event2 already occurred), so ""event1 always happens"" is also false there.
- Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:
- The hypothesis C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., event1 occurs in the future).
- The context says initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred there are no future events (no successor state where events occur).
- Because event2 already occurred and no further events can occur, event1 does not (and cannot) occur — therefore C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is already false (and there is no next state with event1), C2 is also false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the claim ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2 is the claim ""C1 does not hold.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions (context):
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
These details do not affect the logical form of C1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- The formula ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" is a tautology (A → A). It is true in all circumstances, and in particular it is true given the context (event2 indeed happens initially).

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
These constraints do not conflict with each other for evaluating C1.

Step 3 — examine C1
C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) in classical logic — it is always true. Concretely, since event2 does happen initially, the antecedent and consequent are both true, so the implication is true in this situation as well.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. But C1 does hold (tautologically and concretely here), so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false.
2. C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication — it is true whenever event2 happens, and even vacuously true if event2 did not happen.
3. The context explicitly says event2 happened initially, so the antecedent of C1 is true and the consequent is the same true fact; therefore C1 holds.
4. Since C1 holds, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.

Thus C2 is False."

Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens. (This disjunction is equivalent to “event2 happens” because C1 asserts event2 happens.)

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no future events are possible.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 were to occur, event1 must occur after it.)

Trace the possibilities:
- Event1 already happened initially. That immediately prevents any further events from happening (by the second context statement). Therefore event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No — the context says event1 happened initially, i.e., at the start, so there is no earlier time for event2 to have happened.
- Also, if event2 were to occur, the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” would require event1 to happen after event2; but that is impossible because once event1 has happened initially no events can occur afterward.

Conclusion:
- Event2 cannot happen, so C1 is false.
- C2 is equivalent to “event2 happens” (or to C1), so C2 is also false.

Final answer: False

- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur given the second point.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened and no events can occur after it, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts assert that event2 happens (C1 is that event2 happens); since event2 cannot happen, both are false, so the disjunction is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at every point in time, event1 holds)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., there exists a time after which C1 is true at all times)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Starting with event2, the requirements force the sequence to alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Event1 occurs repeatedly (at every other step) but not at every step because event2 occurs between them.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event1 always happens"" at every time) is false at the initial time (event2 holds) and remains false forever because event2 continues to occur periodically.
- Therefore C1 never becomes true at some point and stay true thereafter, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (interpreted as: at a given time, from that time onward event1 holds at every future step)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., there is some future time after which C1 is true — from that time onward event1 always holds)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so some event1 follows).
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so some event2 follows).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event2.
- By the first rule, event1 must occur sometime after.
- By the second rule, after that event1 there must be another event2.
- Repeating these rules forces an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 4 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event1 always happens"" from some time onward) would require that once it becomes true, no future state can have event2.
- But the alternation rule guarantees that after any event1 a future event2 will occur, so it is impossible to reach a point after which only event1 ever occurs.
- Therefore C1 is never true at any time, so there is no time at which ""C1 eventually holds.""

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. from a moment onward, at every step/event point event1 holds — the usual reading: globally true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. there exists a time after which C1 is true forever).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so event1 follows every event2).
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so event2 follows every event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Starting from the initial event2, the constraints force the infinite alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Event1 occurs infinitely often, but it never holds continuously from some point onward (because every event1 is followed by event2).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 (""event1 always happens"" forever from some point) never becomes true in this system.
- Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — Understand the statements
- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has occurred.
- Context: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has happened, nothing else can happen afterward — in particular, event1 cannot happen after event2.
- Context: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes event1 terminal if it were to occur.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (Implication: event1 → event2.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether that is true.

Step 3 — Reasoning about C1
- Given the context, event2 has happened (initially). Therefore in the actual scenario described, event2 is true.
- An implication ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is true whenever either event1 never happens or event2 does happen in that scenario.
- Here, event1 cannot occur after event2 (since no events occur after event2), and event2 already happened initially, so any scenario consistent with the context either has event1 impossible or still has event2 true.
- Thus there is no allowed case where event1 happens and event2 does not. Therefore C1 is true (vacuously or because event2 already occurred).

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Implication: event1 → event2.)
- C2: C1 does not hold. We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So in every allowed scenario event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means once event2 has occurred (and it has, initially), no further events (including event1) can occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This just says event1 would be terminal if it occurred.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur in any permitted sequence. There is no possible world consistent with the context where event1 happens.
- An implication ""if event1 then event2"" is true in all cases where event1 cannot occur (vacuously true).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 holds (vacuously), so the claim C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So in every possible history/event trace given the context, event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (and it has initially), nothing can occur afterward.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This only restricts what can follow event1.)

Step 3 — reason about possible traces
- Because event2 happened initially and nothing can happen after event2, there is no trace in which event1 occurs without event2 already having occurred.
- Any trace where event1 occurs will have event2 true (it is already true initially, or they could be simultaneous), so the implication ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" is true in all allowed traces.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 holds. Therefore the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (read as: at the current state, event2 holds in the immediately following state)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., at every state, event2 holds in the next state)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially (state0): event1 happened.
- Rule A: after event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 at some state, event2 at the next).
- Rule B: after event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 at some state, event1 at the next).

Step 3 — trace states
- state0: event1 (given).
- state1: by Rule A, event2.
- state2: by Rule B, event1.
- state3: by Rule A, event2.
- ... so the events alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 holds at state0 (since state1 has event2).
- C2 says C1 must hold at every state. But at state1 the next state (state2) has event1, not event2, so C1 is false at state1.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (interpret as: from the current/state-of-evaluation, the immediate next state has event2).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every state, the next state has event2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially (state S0): event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so if a state has event1, the next state must have event2).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so if a state has event2, the next state must have event1).

Step 3 — trace states:
- S0: event1 (given).
- By Rule A, S1 must have event2. So C1 is true at S0.
- By Rule B, S2 must have event1 (because S1 has event2).
- By Rule A again, S3 must have event2, and so on. The states alternate: S0:event1, S1:event2, S2:event1, S3:event2, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 holds at S0 (next state S1 has event2).
- But at S1, the next state S2 has event1, so C1 is false at S1.
- Since C1 does not hold in every state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, event2 holds in the next state).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened (call that state s0: event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
So states must alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

Step 3 — examine C1 at each state:
- At s0 (event1): next state s1 has event2 ⇒ C1 is true at s0.
- At s1 (event2): next state s2 has event1 ⇒ C1 is false at s1.
Because C1 is false at s1, it is not true at every state.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 requires (event2 eventually happens) AND (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred (hence ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied).
- The rules say: after event2, event1 must happen; and after event1, event2 must happen. These enforce that once event2 has occurred, event1 will occur at some later time (and then event2 again, etc.).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At the initial moment event2 occurred, so C1 is true.
- Because after event2 event1 must happen, event1 will occur sometime after that. Therefore ""event1 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- Both parts of C2 are satisfied (C1 true and event1 happens), so C2 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — What is being asked
We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- Initially, event2 happened. → So event2 has already occurred, hence ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is satisfied.
- After event2, event1 must happen. → Because event2 occurred, event1 must (and therefore will) happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen. → This just ensures the sequence continues but doesn't prevent event1 from occurring after the initial event2.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
Start: event2 occurs (given). By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur. Thus C1 is true (event2 did happen) and event1 happens, so C2 (C1 and event1 happens) is true.

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point).
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate next state it is true that event1 will eventually happen).

2. Understand the context:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so the system is terminal after event2).
   - Also “after event1, no other events can happen” (event1 would also be terminal if it occurred).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - Since event2 has already happened initially and no further events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any future time. Therefore C1 is false.

4. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 asserts that in the next state it will be true that event1 eventually happens. But there are no further events after event2, so in the next state (and all future states) event1 will never occur. Thus C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, C1 is true).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event1 has not happened initially.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means from the initial state onward, no further events (including event1) can ever occur.
- Also: after event1 no other events can happen — irrelevant here because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Since event2 already happened initially and no events can happen afterwards, event1 will never occur at any future point.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false in the initial state and remains false in the next state.

Final answer
False

- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen — irrelevant unless event1 actually occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about event sequences

- Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false in the initial state and in every future state.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 says ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since the context says ""Initially, event1 happened,"" C1 is true at the initial state (an eventuality is satisfied if the event already occurred at the current state).
2. C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the immediate successor state, ""event1 eventually happens"" must be true.
3. The context forces that after event1, event2 must happen next, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore the next state must contain event2 and no later state can contain event1.
4. From that next state there will be no future occurrence of event1, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is false there.
5. Hence C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The system description forces the trace event1 → event2 → (no further events). Event1 occurs initially; event2 must occur later; after event2 nothing else happens.

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" At the initial state this is true (event1 already happened). In temporal logic ""eventually"" is forward-looking but includes the current state, so the initial state satisfies C1.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether, from the next state (after the initial state), it is still true that event1 will eventually happen. But event1 occurred only at the initial state and will not occur again (the only future event is event2, then termination). Therefore in the next state there is no future occurrence of event1, so C1 is false there.

Thus C2 is false.
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" i.e. from the next state onward, event1 eventually happens.

Examine the context and trace states:
1. Initially (current state) event1 happened. So C1 is true in the initial state.
2. The rules say: after event1, event2 must happen. So in the next state(s) event2 will occur.
3. After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot happen again in any later state.

Evaluate C2 (C1 in the next state):
- At the next state, event1 has already occurred in the past, but ""eventually happens"" is about the current or future states from that point. Given the required occurrence of event2 next and that after event2 no events (including event1) can occur, there is no future state from the next state in which event1 will happen.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 claims: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. event2 → (event1 and event2). This reduces to event2 → event1 (since event2 → event2 is trivial).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so there is a possible history where event2 occurs at the start).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must follow).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- The initial condition gives a sequence where event2 happens and no events occur before it; because event2 is terminal, no event1 can occur after it. So there is a possible history where event2 happens but event1 does not.

Step 4 — evaluate the implication:
- Because there exists a possible case with event2 and not event1, event2 does not imply event1 in general. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., event2 ⇒ (event1 and event2), so in particular event2 ⇒ event1)

Step 2 — conditions from the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 must later occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal — no events can occur after it.)

Step 3 — reason about possible event orderings
- Because event2 happens initially, there is no time before it for event1 to have happened. 
- Because event2 is terminal, nothing (including event1) can happen after it.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event1 and event2"") is false (event2 happens but event1 does not).
- C2 (""if event2 then C1"") is false because the antecedent (event2) is true but the consequent (C1) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event2 happens"".
- C2 = ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"", i.e. event2 → (event1 ∧ event2). This is equivalent to event2 → event1.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events can occur after that initial event2).
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is only a conditional; it does not force event1 to occur.

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2:
- A valid scenario consistent with the context: initially event2 happened and event1 never happens. This satisfies all context statements (event2 did happen; nothing can happen after it).
- In that scenario event2 is true but event1 is false, so event2 → event1 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the start).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 occurs.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- But in the actual scenario event1 does happen initially, and because no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur after it. There is no earlier time for event2 (event1 is initial).
- Therefore event2 does not happen, so the implication ""if event1 then event2"" is false in this scenario (event1 true, event2 false).

Step 3 — examine C2
- C2 asserts: C1 holds and event2 happens.
- Since C1 is false and event2 does not happen, the conjunction C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What C2 says:
- C2 asserts two things: (i) C1 holds (i.e., ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is true) and (ii) event2 happens.

Step 2 — What the context gives:
- Initially, event1 happened.  
- After event1, no other events can happen.  
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Can event2 happen?
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur after event1. There is no indication event2 happened before the initial event1, and ""initially event1 happened"" implies event1 is the first event. So event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — Is C1 true?
- C1 (""If event1 happens then event2 happens"") has a true antecedent (event1 did happen) but a false consequent (event2 did not happen). Therefore C1 is false.

Step 5 — Conclusion about C2:
- C2 requires both C1 to hold and event2 to happen. Both are false, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning (concise):

- Facts: event1 did happen initially. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event2) can occur once event1 has occurred. Therefore event2 did not happen.
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""): antecedent is true (event1 happened) but consequent is false (event2 did not happen), so C1 is false.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens""): C1 is false and event2 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 has already occurred (in the current state).
- The rules say that after event1, event2 must happen, and once event2 has happened no further events can occur. That makes event2 a required (and terminal) future event after the initial event1.
- C1 asserts that ""Event1 happens in the next state."" The context gives no rule that event1 repeats in the next state; instead event2 must occur after event1 (and may be the next event). So C1 is not guaranteed and need not hold.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., that in the next state it is true that event1 happens in the following state). Since C1 itself is not entailed by the context, C2 is also not entailed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = ""in the next state, Event1 happens in the following state"" (i.e., Event1 would have to occur two steps from now).
- From the context: initially Event1 occurs, then Event2 must occur after Event1, and after Event2 no further events can happen. So the next state has Event2, and the state after that has no events.
- Therefore Event1 does not occur in the next state (C1 is false) and certainly does not occur two steps ahead (C2 is false).
---
We want to know whether C2 is true in the initial state.

1) Identify the meanings:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time t+1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at time t+1 it is true that event1 happens in the following state t+2). So C2 asserts ""event1 happens at t+2.""

2) Use the context to build the timeline:
- Initially (t0): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → at t1: event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen → at t2 and later: no events.

3) Evaluate C2:
- C2 requires event1 at t2. But t2 has no events (after event2 nothing happens), so event1 does not occur at t2.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., C2 asserts that Event1 does happen).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 occurs.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur thereafter.
- (The statement ""After event1, no other events can happen."" is irrelevant if event1 never occurs; it only would matter if event1 happened.)

Step 3 — trace the event sequence:
- Event2 has occurred initially.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, Event1 cannot occur after event2.
- There is no information that event1 occurred before event2; the context states event2 happened initially, so Event1 does not happen at any point.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e., C1 is false) is therefore false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the statement ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold,"" i.e. C2 asserts that Event1 does happen.

Step 2 — examine the context
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the start of the timeline event2 has occurred.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- The fact ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant given event1 does not occur after event2; it only constrains sequences that would start with event1.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event2 occurs initially and no events can occur after event2, there is no point in the timeline at which event1 can occur.
- Nothing in the context states event1 occurred before the initial moment; the natural reading is that the only occurred event is the initial event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- Therefore C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold, i.e. that Event1 does happen) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is ""Event1 does not happen,"" C2 asserts that ""Event1 does happen"" (equivalently, that C1 is false). We must decide whether that claim is true or false.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- If event1 happened before event2, then ""after event1 no other events can happen"" would forbid event2 — contradicting that event2 did happen initially. So event1 could not have happened before event2.
- If event1 happened after event2, then ""after event2 no other events can happen"" forbids event1. So event1 could not have happened after event2.
- There is no time when event1 could have happened without contradicting the given facts. Therefore event1 did not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is therefore false.

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event2 does not eventually happen"").
- From the context, event2 happened initially. That means event2 has already occurred, so ""event2 eventually happens"" is true.
- The other context statements (""after event2 no other events can happen"" and ""after event1 event2 must happen"") do not contradict that event2 has already happened; they only restrict possible subsequent events.

Therefore C1 is true, so C2 (that C1 does not hold) is false.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false).

- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (No effect on whether event2 happened.)
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (Irrelevant because event2 already happened initially.)

Step 3 — trace the events:
- Since event2 happened initially, the statement ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied (the occurrence at the initial time counts as an occurrence).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened.""
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, no further events may occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 occurs, no further events may occur.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- The context explicitly states event1 did happen initially.
- Because event1 happened and it forbids any subsequent events, event2 cannot happen after event1.
- Could event2 have happened before event1? No: if event2 had happened before event1, then ""after event2, no other events can happen"" would forbid event1 from occurring afterward, contradicting the given that event1 happened initially.
- Therefore event2 did not happen at any point.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 happens or event1 happens"") is true because event1 happened.
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") requires event2 to have happened as well; since event2 did not happen, C2 is false.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
C2 is ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" We must decide if C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen — irrelevant unless event2 happens.)

Step 3 — trace events:
Because event1 happened initially and prevents any other events, event2 cannot happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 = (Event2 happens) OR (Event1 happens). Event1 is true, so C1 is true.
- C2 = (Event2 happens) AND C1. Event2 is false, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2 = (event2 happens) AND C1.

Step 2 — Understand the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- The statement ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 actually occurs.

Step 3 — Reason through sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially, C1 is true (event1 happens satisfies the OR).
- For C2 to be true, event2 must happen as well. But event1 already happened initially and prevents any other events from happening after it, so event2 cannot occur at any time following the initial event1. There is no indication event2 occurred before the initial event1, and ""initially"" means event1 is the starting event, so event2 does not occur.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means no event can occur after event1. So event2 cannot occur after event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before event1? No — if event2 had occurred before, then “after event2, no other events can happen” would prevent event1 from happening. But event1 did happen, so event2 could not have happened earlier.
- Therefore event2 did not happen at all. So C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is false (event1 happened but event2 did not).
- C2 says “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” The antecedent is true (event1 did happen) but the consequent C1 is false, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
You ask whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs, event2 cannot occur afterwards.
- Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
C1 = ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" But event1 does happen and event2 does not (because no events can follow event1). So C1 is false (counterexample: event1 true, event2 false).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
C2 = ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" The antecedent (event1 happens) is true, but C1 does not hold (it's false). Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

We want to decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 1 — what the context says:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 did occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur after it.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (That makes event2 terminal too, but doesn’t say event2 actually happened.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C1 requires that whenever event1 happens, event2 also happens (at some time).
- But we know event1 did happen initially and, because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen after event1. There is no information that event2 happened before event1, and ""initially event1 happened"" rules out event2 occurring earlier. Therefore event2 did not happen.
- With event1 true and event2 false in the actual situation, the implication C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C2’s antecedent (event1 happens) is true.
- Its consequent (C1 holds) is false (from Step 2).
- A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 asserts: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 asserts: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in the given scenario C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred at the start.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur at any later time.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (This is redundant here because event2 never gets the chance if event1 already blocks subsequent events.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event1 happened initially, by the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no events can occur after that moment. Therefore event2 cannot occur after event1.
- There is no possibility for event2 to have occurred before the initial moment (the context says event1 happened initially), so event2 does not occur at all.

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2:
- C1 (both event1 and event2 happen) is false in this scenario.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in all executions/at all times both event1 and event2 occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since event1 has happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any further events from occurring after that point. Therefore event2 cannot happen after the initial event1.
- There is no indication that event2 happened before the initial state or simultaneously; given the plain reading, both cannot hold together.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is not true (event2 cannot occur once event1 has occurred).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible sequence both event1 and event2 occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- (There is also: after event2 no other events can happen, but this is irrelevant if event2 cannot occur.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 asserts that C1 always holds. C1 says “Event2 always happens.” So C2 is claiming that in all possible executions, it is always true that Event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once the initial event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant if event2 never occurs, but would force event1 to occur after any event2.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
Because event1 has already occurred initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur in any execution.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and then C2
- C1 (“Event2 always happens”) is false because event2 never occurs.
- Therefore C2 (“C1 always holds”) is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., the claim that event2 always happens is true.)

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no events that can occur after the initial moment.
- Thus event2 cannot occur at any time (there is no time after the initial event1 for event2 to happen).
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.

Step 4 — determine C2
- C2 states that C1 always holds. Since C1 is false, C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., it is always true that event2 always happens — equivalently, C1 must be true.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (and it did initially), no further events can occur at any later time.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This only constrains what must follow if event2 occurs.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 occurred initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no possible occurrences of event2 at any time after the initial moment.
- There is no indication event2 happened before the initial moment; the context gives only that initially event1 happened. So event2 does not occur in the system.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs, but it does not force event2 to occur.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because event2 never occurs.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Brief reasoning (concise):
- Hypothesis C2 asserts that ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) and that event1 happens now — i.e., event1 occurs.
- Context says event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur (it would be a ""other event"" after event2).
- So C1 is false and event1 does not happen, hence C2 is false.

Final answer: False

- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no further events can occur, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- Therefore ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is false, and event1 does not happen.

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (effectively requires Event1 to happen)

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- Since event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur after the initial time.
- The only way event1 could have occurred is before that initial event2, but there is no information that it did.
- Therefore ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, and so ""event1 happens"" (and thus C2) is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

1) What the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true only if Event1 actually occurs (which also makes C1 true).

2) Context conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

3) Reasoning about possible sequences:
- Since event2 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no events can occur at any later time.
- Therefore Event1 cannot occur after that initial event2.
- Could Event1 have occurred before the initial event2? ""Initially"" denotes the starting point; there is no earlier time to place Event1. No information says Event1 has already happened initially.
- Thus there is no way for Event1 to occur at any time given the context.

4) Conclusion:
- C1 is false (Event1 does not eventually happen), so C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- So C2 is essentially equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (since if Event1 happens, C1 is automatically true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So at the very start an occurrence of event2 has already happened.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Any occurrence of event1 would be followed by an occurrence of event2.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once any event2 has occurred, no further events are allowed.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because an event2 has already happened initially, rule 3 forbids any events after that initial event2. Therefore no event1 can occur after the initial event2.
- Event1 cannot have occurred before the initial event2, because ""initially"" denotes the start state (there is no earlier time).
- Hence event1 never occurs in any allowed execution.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 is the conjunction: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens). We must decide whether that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1: “Event1 always happens.” The context gives an alternating requirement: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. That yields a sequence like event2, event1, event2, event1, ... Event1 does occur repeatedly, but it does not hold at every moment (for example, initially event2 happened and event1 was not happening at that time). Therefore “event1 always happens” (i.e., at all times) is not guaranteed. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — examine the other conjunct
“Event1 happens” is true in the context (it must happen immediately after the initial event2).

Step 4 — combine
C2 = (C1) AND (event1 happens) = False AND True = False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens).
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens.""

Step 2 — understand conditions:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So events alternate forever: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- ""Always happens"" means event1 holds at every moment. That is false because there are moments when event2 occurs instead of event1 (e.g., the initial event2 and every other step).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- Although event1 does happen (it occurs repeatedly), C2 requires C1 to hold as well. Since C1 is false, the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence:
Starting with event2, the rules force event1 next, then event2, then event1, and so on. The events alternate indefinitely: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" If ""always"" means ""at every moment"" or ""in every step,"" that's false — there are steps where event2 happens and event1 does not. (Event1 does occur repeatedly, but not at every step.)
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event1 to happen. Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false regardless of event1 occurring at some times.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the immediate next step).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate next state, C1 is true (which effectively says Event2 happens two steps from now).

Step 2 — use the given constraints
- Initially event2 happened (time 0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at the next step, event1 occurs).
- After event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0: event2 has occurred.
- At time 1 (the next state): because after event2 event1 must happen, event1 occurs.
- After time 1: no further events can occur, so event2 cannot happen again at time 2 or later.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is false: the next state has event1, not event2.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false: in the next state (where event1 has occurred), C1 would assert that event2 happens in the following state, but after event1 no events can happen, so that cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e., at the next time step.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, C1 is true — equivalently, event2 happens two steps from now.)

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially (time 0), event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at the next step after event2, event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, no events occur afterwards).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- time 0: event2 (given).
- time 1: because event2 requires event1 after it, event1 must occur at time 1.
- time 2 and later: because event1 occurred at time 1 and no other events can happen after event1, no events (including event2) can occur at time 2.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 asserts event2 occurs at time 1. But at time 1 event1 occurs (and no additional events are allowed), so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., at time 1 event2 will happen at time 2). But because no events can happen after event1 at time 1, event2 cannot occur at time 2, so C1 is false in time 1. Thus C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (This is evaluated at the current (initial) state; it claims event2 occurs in the immediately following state.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (This claims that in the next state, C1 is true — i.e., from the next state, event2 happens in that state's next state, i.e. two steps ahead of now.)

Step 2 — apply the context
- Initially (now), event2 happened.
- Given ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" the next state (one step after now) must have event1.
- Given ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" the state after that (two steps after now) has no events.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event2 in the next state): the next state has event1, not event2 → C1 is false now.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): in the next state, C1 would assert that event2 happens in that state's next state (the state two steps from now). But two steps from now there are no events (because event1 forbids further events), so C1 is false in the next state. Therefore C2 is false now.

Sample responses:
Let's reason step by step.

1. Context rules:
   - Initially, event2 has happened.
   - After event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward.
   - After event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.

2. From the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen at some later time. So event1 will occur.

3. Once that event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur again later.

4. This creates an alternating sequence: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → event1 → ..., so both events occur (and reoccur) indefinitely.

5. C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true (it already happened initially and recurs). C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") requires event1 to happen and C1 to hold; both are satisfied by the sequence above.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — conditions from the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After any event1 occurs, event2 must happen (i.e., event1 → eventually event2).
- After any event2 occurs, event1 must happen (i.e., event2 → eventually event1).

Step 3 — trace the implications:
- Because event2 already happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces that event1 will happen (at least once) after that initial event2.
- Once that event1 happens, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to happen again.
- Thus events will occur (at least) as: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → ... ; so both events do occur (and alternate).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially, and will happen again).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen (as forced by the initial event2), and C1 holds, so C2 is True.

Answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires Event1 to happen and Event2 to eventually happen.

Step 2 — use the context rules:
- Initially event2 happened (so Event2 has occurred at time 0).
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. Because Event2 happened initially, Event1 must happen sometime after.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. Once Event1 happens (from Rule A), Event2 must follow.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At t0: Event2 occurred (given).
- By Rule A: at some t1 > t0, Event1 occurs.
- By Rule B: at some t2 > t1, Event2 occurs again.
- This yields at least one occurrence of Event1 and repeated occurrences of Event2 (possibly indefinitely alternating).

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 (Event2 eventually happens): True — Event2 already happened at t0 and will happen again at t2.
- C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds""): True — Event1 occurs (by Rule A) and C1 holds.

True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every state/time point).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate next state, it is true that event1 always happens).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially (state 0): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state 1: event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so state 2: event1).
Thus events alternate: state0: e1, state1: e2, state2: e1, state3: e2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false, because event1 does not occur at the odd states (e.g., state1 has event2).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (state1). But at state1 event2 occurs, so ""event1 always happens"" is false at state1 as well.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., in every state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at the immediate successor state, C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So the system yields an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is false: there are states where event2 (not event1) occurs, so event1 does not hold in every state.
- The next state after the initial one is a state where event2 happens; in that state C1 is still false (future alternation ensures event1 does not hold in all subsequent states).

Final answer:
False

First identify the hypothesis:

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the immediate next state, event1 holds at every state from there).

Examine the conditions and trace states:
- State0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → State1: event2 happens (so event1 is false in State1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → State2: event1 happens.
- The events alternate: event1 at State0, event2 at State1, event1 at State2, etc.

Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false, because at State1 event1 does not happen.
- C2 claims C1 holds in the next state (State1). But in State1 event1 is false, so C1 does not hold there.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""event2 happens"" (event2 or event2 simplifies to event2).
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" i.e. ""event2 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So in the state following the initial one, no events occur.)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 can occur; it does not force event2 to occur.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since initially event1 happened and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen in the next state.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. ""event2 happens in the next state"".

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so the current/initial state has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means in every state following the initial one, no events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- The next state comes after the initial state where event1 happened, so by the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" event2 cannot happen in that next state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is “event2 happens” (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2 is “C1 holds in the next state,” i.e. “event2 happens in the next state.”

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there is no successor state in which any event, including event2, can occur).
- “After event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur given the previous point.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and conclude:
- Since event1 has already happened and no further events can occur, event2 cannot happen in any next state (in fact there is no next state where events occur). Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold.""

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The formula ""if P then P"" (P → P) is a tautology in standard logic: it is true for both P true and P false. So C1 is always true.

Step 3 — consider the context:
- The temporal facts (initially event2; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen) do not change that C1 is a logical tautology.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds, therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold.""

Step 2 — examine C1
- In standard logic the implication P → P is a tautology: it is always true. So read plainly, C1 holds regardless of the event sequences given in the context.
- (If one instead interpreted C1 temporally as ""after event2, event2 must happen next,"" that would be a different claim and could conflict with the context. But the plain reading of C1 is the logical implication P → P.)

Step 3 — conclusion about C2
- Since C1 does hold, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
That yields an alternating sequence starting with event2 (so event2 does occur, and occurs again later as well).

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 is the implication ""event2 → event2"", which is a logical tautology (an event implies itself). Given the context event2 indeed happens, so the implication is true; more generally a proposition implies itself in standard logic.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 claims C1 does not hold. Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Because event2 happened in the initial state and event2 is terminal, no events can occur after that — in particular event1 cannot occur after event2.
- There is no prior state before the initial state where event1 could have happened (the problem states event2 happened initially), so we cannot assume event1 also happened.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 and event1 both happen"") is not satisfied.
- If C1 is false in the current state, it cannot hold in the next state; moreover, there is no next state reachable after event2 since it forbids any further events.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what’s asked:
C2 asserts that C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") holds in the next state.

Step 2 — given conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true initially).
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event1 has not occurred yet.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Because event2 has occurred initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur in any subsequent state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
C1 requires both event2 and event1 to hold. In the next state there cannot be event1 (due to the after-event2 restriction), so C1 cannot hold in that next state.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (in the state immediately after the initial one).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2.
- There is no indication event1 happened before the initial event2, and the usual reading of “initially, event2 happened” rules out a prior event1.
- Therefore it is impossible for both event2 and event1 to have happened (C1 is not satisfied), and there is no next state in which C1 could hold.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, C1 is true — equivalently: two steps from now, event2 happens.)

- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has happened, there can be no further events in any subsequent state.
- (""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur if no events can happen after event1.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
- Because event1 has already happened initially, no events (including event2) can occur in any later state.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false in the current state.
- In the next state, the same prohibition holds, so C1 is also false there; hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Clarify the timeline and rules:
   - Let S0 be the initial state. In S0, event1 has happened.
   - Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs in some state Si, then event1 must occur in the next state Si+1.
   - Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred in some state, no events can occur in any subsequent states.

2. What the hypothesis statements mean:
   - C1 (at S0): ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e., event2 happens in S1.
   - C2 (at S0): ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in S1 it is true that event2 happens in S2.

3. Apply the rules:
   - Since event1 occurred in S0 and Rule B forbids any events after event1, no events can occur in S1 or any later state. Therefore event2 cannot occur in S1, so C1 is false at S0.
   - Because no events can occur in any future state after S0, event2 cannot occur in S2 either, so C1 does not become true in S1. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (temporal: X event2).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (temporal: X C1 = X X event2, i.e. event2 happens two steps ahead).
The question: Is C2 true given the context?

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially (now) event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — so once event1 has occurred, no events occur in any future state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 occurs.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 just happened and no events can occur afterward, event2 cannot happen in the next state or any later state.
- Therefore C1 (event2 in the next state) is false now.
- Consequently C2 (that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. event2 in two steps) is also false.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state it is true that event2 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one will have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (they alternate: event2, event1, event2, ...).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Initial state: event2.
- Next state: event1 (so event2 does not hold in that next state).
- Because the next state contains event1, it is not true there that ""event2 always happens"" (C1 fails there).

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every future state, event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asking whether C1 is true when evaluated one step from now.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions and trace the sequence:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rules force alternation: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- So the sequence of events is: event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, ...

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 in the next state:
- In the next state (immediately after the initial), event1 happens, so event2 does not hold there.
- Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" is false when evaluated at that next state.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — read as: in every state, Event2 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C1 is true when evaluated at the immediate next state.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially Event2 happened (state 0).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so in the next state, state 1, Event1 holds).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so in state 2, Event2 holds), and this alternation continues.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- States: 0: Event2, 1: Event1, 2: Event2, 3: Event1, ...
- Event2 holds in even-numbered states but not in odd-numbered ones.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false at any given state because there are states (e.g., state 1) where Event2 does not hold.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.

First, identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at every relevant time/state, event1 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., at every time/state, C1 is true)

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur eventually).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Trace a run: at the start event1 occurs; then event2 must occur; after event2 no further events occur. At times after event2, event1 does not occur, so ""event1 always happens"" (C1) is false at those times. Because C1 is not true at all times, the claim that ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1 says “Event1 always happens.” Interpreting “always” temporally (i.e., at every time/state), C1 asserts that event1 holds in all states.
- From the context: event1 happens initially. Then (by the rule) event2 must happen after event1, and after event2 no further events can occur. So there is a later state (after event2) in which event1 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 (that event1 occurs in every state) is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds; since C1 is false, C2 is also false.

Thus C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
C2 asserts that ""C1 always holds."" C1 says ""Event1 happens in the next state."" We must decide whether C2 (that C1 holds in every state) is true.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the next state after the initial one has no events).
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur initially).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- At the initial state, since event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false at the initial state.
- C2 requires C1 to hold always (in every state). Because C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 cannot be true.

- After event2, no other events can happen (so the state reached after the initial event is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- From the initial state event2 already happened and it is terminal, so there is no next state in which event1 can happen. Therefore C1 is false in the initial (and only reachable) situation.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires C1 to hold in all states. Because C1 is false (as shown), C2 cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Trace/reason:
- From the initial state event2 has happened.
- Since after event2 no other events can happen, in the next state no event occurs (in particular, event1 does not happen).
- Therefore C1 is false in the initial state (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- Because C1 is not true in at least one state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — both events occur (at some times).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some point in the timeline both events have occurred.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred at the start.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen — irrelevant here because event1 does not occur before event2.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Since event2 already happened initially, the system is in a state where no further events can occur. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- There is no indication event1 happened before the initial moment; ""initially, event2 happened"" rules out earlier events.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- It is impossible for both event2 and event1 to have happened. Therefore C1 cannot hold, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 requires both ""event2 happens"" and ""event1 happens"".
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 already occurred at the start.
- The context also states ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That forbids any events occurring after that initial event2, including event1.
- There is no information that event1 happened before the initial state, so the only possible times for event1 would be after event2, which is prohibited.
- Therefore C1 never becomes true, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point both event2 and event1 have occurred.
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So if event1 occurs, nothing can occur afterwards.

Step 3 — reason about possible event orderings
- Because event2 has already occurred initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no additional events (including event1) can occur after that point. Therefore event1 cannot happen later.
- Could event1 have happened before event2? No: if event1 had happened before, then after event1 no other events could happen, which would prevent event2 from occurring later. But event2 did occur initially, so event1 could not have happened before.
- Simultaneous occurrence would be required to have both without violating the ""after"" clauses, but the context treats events as occurring in order and uses ""after"" to prohibit any other events — simultaneous occurrence is not supported by the given statements.

Step 4 — conclusion
- There is no timeline consistent with the context in which both event2 and event1 occur. Therefore C1 cannot hold, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen.
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 happens, C1 is true (disjunction true if one disjunct is true).
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false). But C1 is true, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
C2 asserts that ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. that neither event2 nor event1 happens. We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing occurs after that).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 didn't need to occur and cannot occur after event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — this is true because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — this is the negation of a true statement, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (event2 ∨ event1)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (¬(event2 ∨ event1) — i.e., neither event2 nor event1 happens)

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no further event1 could occur after event2).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 did not need to occur to make event2 true; event2 already occurred.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event2 happened, the disjunction in C1 (event2 ∨ event1) is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, but C1 does hold. Therefore C2 is false.

Step 1 — what’s asked
C2 asserts ""C1 always holds."" C1 is the statement ""Event1 does not happen."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 necessarily occurs because event2 already happened.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant to whether event1 occurs.)

Step 3 — trace the events
Because event2 happened initially and that forces event1 to happen afterwards, event1 does happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in all executions/traces, event1 never happens).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 is forced to occur following event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Since event2 has happened initially and event1 must follow event2, event1 does happen.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false in the given scenario.

Step 4 — Determine C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (that event1 never happens in any execution).
- But we have an execution (the actual one) where event1 does happen, so C1 does not hold there; hence C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (a conditional)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is a tautology (p → p). It is always true whenever read as a standard material conditional. So C1 holds.

Step 3 — use the context to check whether event1 happens
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" implies that because event2 did happen initially, event1 must happen subsequently.
- (The other rule, ""After event1, event2 must happen"", just implies repeated alternation, but it doesn't prevent event1 from occurring.)

Step 4 — combine results
- C1 holds (true) and event1 does happen (true), so the conjunction C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify what’s asked
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens). We must decide whether that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — Examine C1
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p) and therefore holds.

Step 3 — Determine whether event1 happens
- Context: initially event2 happened.
- Context rule: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Since event2 did happen initially, event1 must (and therefore does) happen afterward.

Step 4 — Combine
- C1 holds (tautology) and event1 does happen (from the initial event2 and the given rule), so the conjunction C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (p → p)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1 is a tautology: p → p is always true. So C1 holds.

Step 3 — check whether event1 happens
- Context says initially event2 happened.
- Context also says ""after event2, event1 must happen"" (event2 → event1).
- Since event2 did happen initially, that rule forces that event1 happens afterward. So event1 indeed happens.

Step 4 — conclude C2

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.
2. C1 says ""Event2 always happens."" C2 asserts that this statement (C1) is always true.
3. From the context: initially event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the start). After that event1 must happen, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the only sequence is event2, then event1, then termination.
4. ""Always happens"" is a stronger claim than ""happened initially"": it requires event2 to hold at all times / in all states. But after event1 no events occur, so event2 does not hold at those later times — and we have no basis to claim event2 occurs at every time or in every possible situation.
5. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to be always true, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reason: Read ""always"" as a global property. C1 says ""event2 holds at every time."" The trace allowed by the context is: event2 (initially), then event1, then no events. After event1 there are times when event2 does not occur, so C1 is not true globally; therefore the claim C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Given the context, every execution begins with event2, so in every complete run event2 does occur — C1 is true of the full executions.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” This asks whether C1 is true in every reachable state (i.e., at every point in every execution). After event2, event1 must occur, and after event1 no further events can occur. In states after event1 there is no future occurrence of event2, so the statement “event2 will (still) happen” is false there.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in all states, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and C1
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So events alternate.
- From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will occur in the next state. Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication: if C1 holds then event1 happens.
- C1 explicitly states that event1 happens (in the next state). So if C1 holds, the consequent (""event1 happens"") is satisfied.
- Therefore the implication is true (indeed tautologically true when the antecedent asserts the consequent).

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context.
- C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one must have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate).

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- Since initially event2 happened and ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 does occur in the next state. Thus C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication: if C1 holds then event1 happens.
- Because C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state, the antecedent already entails the consequent; and in fact we have already concluded C1 is true, so the consequent (event1 happens) is true as well.
- Therefore the implication is true.

Final answer:
True

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e., C1 → event1)

- Initially (state S0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen — so in the next state S1, event1 occurs.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so they alternate thereafter.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- From the context: S0 had event2, so S1 must have event1. Therefore C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event1."" Since C1 is true and event1 does indeed occur (in the next state S1), the implication is true.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 has already happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true at the initial state.
- After event2 must come event1, and after event1 no further events can occur. Thus in the immediate next state (and thereafter) event2 will not occur.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. ""event2 eventually happens"" when evaluated from the next state. From that point forward event2 does not occur, so C1 is false in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""Event2 eventually happens."" That is true in the initial state because event2 already happened initially.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state,"" i.e. in the state immediately after the initial one, it must still be true that event2 will eventually happen.
- From the assumptions: after event2 occurs, event1 must occur next, and after event1 no further events can happen. So in the next state event1 will occur and there will be no further events afterward.
- Therefore, from the next state onward, event2 does not (and cannot) happen again. So C1 is false in the next state.

Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context that initially event2 happened, C1 is true at the initial state (event2 has occurred).

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this asks whether, from the next state onward, event2 will eventually happen. After event2 the system must do event1, and after event1 no other events can happen. That means there is no future occurrence of event2 after the initial state. Therefore, starting at the next state, event2 does not (and cannot) eventually happen, so C1 is false in the next state.

Thus C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (evaluated at the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at state1, C1 is true (so event2 happens at state2).

Step 2 — interpret the rules (next-state reading)
- Initially (state0) event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → if event1 occurs at state n then event2 occurs at state n+1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → if event2 occurs at state n then event1 occurs at state n+1.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- state0: event1 (given).
- state1: by the rule after event1 → event2 occurs. So C1 is true at state0.
- state2: by the rule after event2 (state1) → event1 occurs. So at state1, event2 does NOT occur in the next state (state2); instead event1 does.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that at state1, C1 holds (i.e. that event2 occurs at state2). But event2 does not occur at state2 (event1 does). Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (interpreted from the initial state s0 → s1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" i.e. in s1, C1 is true ⇔ event2 happens in s2.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially (s0) event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpreted as: if a state has event1, the next state must have event2.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — interpreted as: if a state has event2, the next state must have event1.
(So states must alternate event1 ↔ event2.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- s0: event1 (given).
- By the rule after event1 → event2, s1 must have event2. So C1 (event2 in the next state from s0) is true.
- Now consider s1: it has event2, and by the rule after event2 → event1, s2 must have event1. Therefore event2 does NOT happen in s2, so C1 is false when evaluated at s1.

Step 4 — determine C2
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (s1). But we just found C1 is false at s1. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
We want to decide whether C2 (the statement ""C1 holds in the next state"") is true in the initial state.

Identify the pieces
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, C1 is true (so event2 would have to happen in the state after that).

Use the context rules
- Initially, event1 happened (state0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs in state1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs in state2).
Thus the events alternate: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ...

Evaluate C1 and C2 from the initial state
- C1 at the initial state: event2 happens in the next state (state1) — True.
- C2 at the initial state: asks whether C1 is true in state1. C1 in state1 would assert that event2 happens in state2. But state2 has event1 (not event2), so C1 is False in state1. Therefore C2 is False in the initial state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
You ask whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just event2 happens (a tautology).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"", C2 is also equivalent to ""event2 happens"".

Step 4 — reason about occurrence:
From the context, after event1 (which did happen) event2 must happen, so event2 does indeed happen.

Conclusion:
True
---
Identify hypothesis: C2 = (C1 holds) or (event2 happens). Note C1 = (event2 happens) or (event2 happens) which is just ""event2 happens"".

Context: event1 happened initially, and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" so event2 does happen. Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" just makes event2 terminal but doesn't prevent it from occurring.

Since event2 happens, C1 is true, and therefore C2 (C1 or event2) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" (redundant disjunction) — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 ≡ ""Event2 happens"", C2 is also equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to whether event2 happens).

Step 3 — trace events:
- event1 occurs initially.
- Because event1 forces event2, event2 occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"", and event2 does happen from the context. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as: at every point in time (from that point onward) event2 holds (i.e., G(event2)).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — interpreted as: there exists a future point at which C1 becomes true (i.e., F(G(event2))).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (time 0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at time 1 event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from time 2 onward, no events occur).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Time 0: event2 occurs.
- Time 1: event1 occurs (required after event2).
- Time 2+: no events occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event2 always happens) is false at time 0 because at time 1 event2 does not occur. At time 1 and thereafter it is also false (event2 does not hold at every subsequent time). So C1 never holds at any point.
- Therefore C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") is false because there is no future point at which C1 becomes true.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The hypothesis asks whether ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event2 always happens"".
2. Interpretations:
   - C1: from some moment onward, at every time point/Event step event2 occurs (i.e., event2 holds globally/always).
   - C2: there exists a future moment after which C1 is true (i.e., eventually we reach a point from which event2 holds forever).
3. From the conditions:
   - Initially event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the start).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after that).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (the execution terminates once event1 has occurred).
4. The only possible execution trace is: event2, then event1, then termination. Event2 does not occur after event1, so there is no suffix of the trace where event2 holds at every subsequent step.
5. Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false in every relevant future, and so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false as well.

Final answer: False.
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every future point/event, event2 holds).
2. We are told: initially event2 happened.
3. Also: after event2, event1 must happen. So sometime after the initial event2, event1 occurs.
4. And: after event1, no other events can happen. Thus once event1 happens, no further occurrences of event2 (or any event) are possible.
5. Therefore event2 does not hold at all times (it happens initially but not after event1), so C1 is false.
6. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — that at some later point event2 will henceforth always hold. Given step 4, there is no future point from which event2 holds at every subsequent moment (after event1 nothing happens, so event2 does not become permanently true). Thus C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point both events have occurred).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (no events can occur after that initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — Reason about possible sequences:
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no further events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Event2 cannot have occurred before the initial event1 (there is no “before” the initial state), and simultaneous occurrence would conflict with the given ordering constraints (and in any case would not allow event2 to be followed by event1 as required by ""after event2, event1 must happen"").

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- There is no possible timeline consistent with the conditions in which both event1 and event2 occur. Therefore C1 never holds, so C2 is False.

False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (both occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there will be a time when both event1 and event2 have occurred.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, no events can occur at any later time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This rule could only be relevant if event2 occurred before event1; but event1 already occurred initially, so there is no earlier time for event2.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- Event2 cannot have occurred before the initial event1 (there is no earlier time given).
- Therefore event2 never happens.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 (both event1 and event2 happen) is never satisfied because event2 never happens.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true only if Event2 happens now (or at the relevant state) and also Event2 happens in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true in the current/initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after that event2 must contain event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the state after that must contain event2), and so on.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Time 0 (initial): event2 happened.
- Time 1 (next state): by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 happens.
- Time 2: by ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 happens.
So the immediate next state (time 1) contains event1, not event2.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2

- C2 requires both ""Event2 happens"" (true at the initial state) and C1 (false). The conjunction is therefore false.

Let's think step by step.

1. Identify the hypothesis:

   - C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (i.e., C2 is the conjunction of event2 happening and C1 being true)

2. Understand the context rules:
   - Initially, event2 happened (state0).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after any event2 must be event1).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so the state after an event1 must be event2).

3. Trace the sequence from the initial condition:

   - By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", state1 must be event1.
   - Then by ""after event1, event2 must happen"", state2 will be event2, and so on alternating.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction meaning: Event2 happens.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires Event1 happens AND Event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means once event2 has happened (and it happened initially), no event1 can occur afterwards.
- After event1, event2 must happen. This is a conditional (if event1 then event2), but it does not force event1 to have happened.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen, there is no time at which event1 can occur (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and “initially event2 happened” rules out any earlier events).
- Therefore Event2 is true, Event1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 is true (event2 happened).
- C2 requires Event1 to be true as well; but Event1 does not happen.
- Thus C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" We must decide if C2 can be true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the starting point event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This places a requirement if event1 occurs, but does not by itself force event1 to occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens,"" which is just a redundant conjunction asserting event2 happens. That is true because event2 happened initially. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
C2 requires that event1 happens and C1 holds. We already have C1 true, so the remaining requirement is that event1 happens. Could event1 happen?
- It cannot happen after event2 because the context forbids any events after event2.
- The context states event2 happened initially, so there is no prior time in which event1 could have happened (the model starts with event2 already having occurred).
Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time under the given context. So the conjunct ""event1 happens"" is false.

Conclusion
C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C2 is true or false. C2 is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., simply ""Event2 happens"").

Step 2 — understand the context rules
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur afterward.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1 reduces to ""Event2 happens."" That is true because event2 happened initially.
- C2 requires both ""Event1 happens"" and C1. C1 is true, so the remaining question is whether Event1 happens.

Step 4 — trace possible sequences
- Event2 has already happened initially. Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no events can occur after that point.
- For Event1 to have happened at any time, it would have to be before event2. But the context states event2 happened initially (the starting event), so there is no room for prior events. Therefore Event1 cannot have occurred.
- Even if one tried to place Event1 before Event2, that would contradict ""Initially, event2 happened.""

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- We start in the initial state where event2 has happened.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, the next state cannot have any events, in particular event1 cannot occur in the next state.

Step 1 — identify: C2 states the negation of C1. C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens."" So C2 = ""Event1 does not eventually happen.""

Step 2 — examine conditions: The context says event1 happened initially. Also the rules force alternation: after event1 → event2 must happen, and after event2 → event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace: event1 already occurred initially, and the rules ensure event1 will occur again (alternating with event2).

Conclusion: C1 is true, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event1 does not eventually happen"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions:

- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
These rules force the events to alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Event1 occurs initially, so C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is already satisfied.
- Moreover, because event2 must follow and then event1 must follow, event1 will occur again and in fact infinitely often.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:

- The additional rules (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1) enforce that event1 will continue to occur (it occurred initially and will recur after each event2), but that is unnecessary to conclude C1.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is the statement ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (interpreted as both holding in the same state).
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" implies event1 happens in the next state, but not in the initial state.
- Therefore the next state has event1 true but event2 is no longer true there.
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to hold in the same state, so C1 does not hold in the next state.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.
- C1 is: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- So C2 says: in the next state, both event2 and event1 happen.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs in the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at some later point — the next state — event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- State0 (initial): event2 happens.
- State1 (next): event1 must happen (and after it nothing else can happen).
- In State1, event1 occurs, but event2 does not occur there (it already occurred in State0).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to happen in the same state.
- In the next state only event1 happens; event2 does not happen there.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one)

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state event1 must occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the states
- Initial state: event2 happened (event2 true), event1 not yet.
- Next state: event1 happens (event1 true). Event2 does not happen in that next state — it occurred previously.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to happen in the same state.
- In the next state only event1 happens, not event2.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds (i.e. event1 always happens), then event2 happens."" We must decide whether that conditional is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially, and no events can happen after event1, no other events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 does not occur in the actual sequence described.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditional
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") holds here (event1 does occur initially).
- But given C1, event2 does not happen (it is blocked by ""after event1, no other events can happen"").
- Thus the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred in the initial state.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 would also be terminal, but that doesn't matter if it can't occur.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and it prevents any further events, no event after event1 can occur. In particular, event2 cannot occur (there is no opportunity for it after the initial event1).

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): true (it happened initially).
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens""): false, because C1 does hold but event2 cannot happen given that event1 already occurred and blocks further events.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and C1
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened.""
- Context also says: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (And likewise after event2 no other events can happen.)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event1 has already happened initially and no further events occur; so C1 holds in the given scenario.

Step 3 — check C2 under that scenario
- C2 asserts: if C1 holds then event2 happens.
- But since event1 has happened and the context forbids any events after event1, event2 cannot happen.
- Thus the antecedent (C1) is true in the scenario while the consequent (event2 happens) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is True or False.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is P → P, which is a logical tautology (always true).

Step 3 — consider the event constraints (for completeness)
- Initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot actually occur. Whether event2 is impossible or not, the implication ""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"" is still true (tautologically or vacuously).

Conclusion
- C1 holds, so the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether the statement C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical implication of the form P → P. In standard logic this is a tautology: any formula of the form P → P is always true.
- The context (initially event1 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen) does not contradict the form P → P. Even if event2 can never actually occur in the scenario, an implication with an antecedent that never happens is still true (vacuously true).

Step 3 — trace event sequences (to check for any subtlety)
- Initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen, so in this model event2 cannot occur later. That makes the antecedent of C1 false in all actual runs, but that only reinforces that the implication P → P is true (vacuously true).
- There is no situation in the context that makes C1 false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 holds (is true). Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e., event2 ⇒ event2)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" The question: is C2 True or False?

Step 2 — examine the conditions in the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen.
From ""initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" it follows that event2 cannot occur at any time. (Event1 already occurred and blocks any further events.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 is the implication event2 → event2. In standard logic any statement implies itself, so P → P is always true (a tautology), regardless of whether P (event2) can actually occur. Even if event2 is impossible, the implication is vacuously/tautologically true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. But we just established C1 does hold (it is true). Therefore C2 is false.

False

Reasoning (step by step):
- C1 says “event1 does not happen” (in the current state).
- C2 says “C1 holds in the next state,” i.e. in the next state event1 does not happen.
- From the context: initially event2 happened. The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” forces the next state to have event1 true.
- Therefore in the next state event1 does happen, so C1 is false there.
- Hence C2 is false.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, Event1 does not happen.

- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At the initial state event2 occurs.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state must have event1.

- In the next state event1 does happen, so C1 is false there.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is the negation of C1.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the current state event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (meaning in the next state after any state where event2 occurred, event1 must occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 in the next state. Thus C1 is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, but we established C1 is true. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially (state S0) event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Interpreted as: in the next state following an event2, event1 must occur.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (similarly, in the next state after an event1, event2 must occur).

Step 3 — apply the rules to the initial state:
- Since event2 happened in S0, by Rule A event1 must occur in S1 (the next state). Thus C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. Because C1 does hold, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Summary:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen.
- Therefore event1 must happen in the next state, so C1 is true.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" — that is false.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 always happens.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. That makes event2 inevitable given that event1 occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This only makes event2 terminal; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event1 has happened initially and the rule requires event2 to happen after event1, event2 does indeed occur in every allowed sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true under the given context.
- C2 asserts both that event1 happens (true, it happened initially) and that C1 holds (true). Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true exactly if (1) event1 happens and (2) event2 always happens.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Since event1 did happen, event2 must occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen. This only makes event2 terminal; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Event1 happens (given).
- Event2 therefore happens (given the must-happen condition after event1), so C1 holds in this scenario.
- Both parts of C2 are satisfied.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (where C1 is ""Event2 always happens"".)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So Event1 does happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So once Event1 has occurred, Event2 is required to occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That only makes Event2 terminal; it does not prevent Event2 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the event sequences:
- Because Event1 happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" applies, Event2 will occur in every allowable sequence (run) of the system.
- Thus C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true.
- Since Event1 did happen and C1 holds, the conjunction in C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So the initial state includes event2.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — any state where event2 has occurred is terminal (no successor states, and no later events).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — any state where event1 has occurred is also terminal.

Step 3 — consequences for C1 (Event1 happens and Event2 happens)
- If event2 happens at any time, nothing can happen after it, so event1 cannot occur after event2.
- If event1 happened before event2, that would contradict ""after event1 no other events can happen"" because event2 would then occur after event1. So event1 cannot occur before event2 either.
- Therefore, given that event2 happens (it happens initially), event1 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is false in every reachable state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"")
- The initial state is terminal (because event2 happened), so there is no next state. Even ignoring that, C1 is impossible as shown above, so it cannot hold in any state.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (both events occur)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (in the immediate successor state, C1 is true)
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 occurs, there are no subsequent events).
- After event1, no other events can happen (similarly, if event1 occurs, nothing follows).

Step 3 — Reasoning about possible sequences
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, there is no state after the initial one in which a new event can occur.
- For C1 to be true, event1 must also happen (somewhere). Given event2 already occurred initially and forbids any further events, event1 cannot occur after that. There is no earlier state than the initial one where event1 could have occurred (initial is the start).
- Therefore C1 cannot be true in any future or next state. Consequently, C1 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — both events are true in the same (some) state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial/current state event2 is true).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — if event1 occurs the trace stops; no further events occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — if event2 occurs the trace stops; no further events occur.

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- We start in the initial state where event2 has happened. In that state event1 is not stated to have happened, and because event2 has occurred and is terminal (""after event2 no other events can happen""), no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.
- Therefore there is no reachable state in which both event1 and event2 have happened. Also there is no ""next"" state after the initial one because event2 makes the trace terminal.

Conclusion
- C1 cannot be true in the next state (indeed it cannot be true at all after the given initial condition), so C2 is False."

Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- The context says: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has already occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" These prevent any events after whichever occurs first, but they do not negate that event1 already happened.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., that event1 does not eventually happen). That contradicts the fact that C1 is true.

Conclusion
C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.

Examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. This directly asserts C1 (event1 → event2).
- Because event1 did happen and event1 → event2, event2 does happen.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant to the truth of C1 or C2 here.

Trace:
- From the premises we have both C1 true and event2 happens true.

Determine C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: (event2 happens) OR (C1 holds). At least one disjunct is true (in fact both are true), so C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

1) Hypothesis: C1 = (event1 → event2). C2 = (event2 happens) OR C1.

2) From the context ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" C1 is true (that implication holds).

3) Also, since event1 did happen initially, event2 will in fact happen later.

4) Therefore the disjunction in C2 is true (both disjuncts are true, in fact).

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must decide whether the statement C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This directly states the implication C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. So C1 holds.
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" Given C1, that entails event2 happens (so event2 will occur).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" This does not contradict the above; it only limits further events after event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: (event2 happens) OR (C1 holds).
- From the context both disjuncts are true: C1 holds, and event2 happens (because event1 happened and C1 requires event2).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- The question asks whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at least once).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after that).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur again). Thus events alternate indefinitely: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the alternating sequence, both events do occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen (initially and repeatedly) and C1 holds, C2 is also true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
So C2 is effectively saying: Event2 happens and (Event2 happens and event1 happens), which reduces to: Event2 happens and event1 happens.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 occurs at least once.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 occurs (after that initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore another event2 occurs (after that event1). So both events occur.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Then: event1 (required after event2).
- Then: event2 (required after event1).
So at least one occurrence of event1 and at least one occurrence of event2 both happen.

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 happens and event1 happens"") is satisfied.
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is then satisfied as well (and is equivalent to C1).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (so C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens and Event2 happens and Event1 happens"", i.e. ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens"".)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After any Event2, Event1 must happen (so from the initial Event2, Event1 will occur).
- After any Event1, Event2 must happen (which may produce further alternation, but at least one of each occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: Event2 occurs (given).
- Then Event1 must occur (by the second condition).
- Therefore both Event2 and Event1 happen, so C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires Event2 happens (true, from the start) and C1 holds (true, as shown).
- Thus C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 has occurred.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has happened, no further events — including event2 — can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Symmetrically, if event2 occurred it would also prevent further events.)

Step 3 — Examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 did happen initially. But because event1 happened, no other events can happen afterward, so event2 cannot happen at any time. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is false, and event1 happens is true; a conjunction with a false conjunct is false. So C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 is true or false. C2 says: (Event2 happens and Event1 happens) and Event1 happens. That is equivalent to C1 (Event2 and Event1) because Event1 is repeated.

Step 2 — What the context states
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- After Event1, no other events can happen.
- After Event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Consequences for event ordering
- Because Event1 happened initially, any event occurring after Event1 is forbidden, so Event2 cannot occur after Event1.
- If Event2 had occurred before Event1, then ""after Event2, no other events can happen"" would forbid Event1 occurring afterward. So Event2 cannot have occurred before Event1 either.
- Therefore Event1 and Event2 cannot both have happened (they cannot both occur in any ordering).

Step 4 — Evaluate C2
- C2 requires both Event1 and Event2 to have happened. That is impossible given the context.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens and event1 happens and event1 happens"" which is just ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no other events can occur after that — therefore no event2 can occur later.
- (The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and prevents any other events afterward, event2 cannot happen at any time after event1. There is no indication event2 happened before the initial event1, so event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 requires event2 to happen and event1 to happen. Event1 did happen, but event2 did not — so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (which is false) and event1 to happen; therefore C2 is also false.

- Therefore event1 does not happen in the next state (C1 is false).
- That makes C2 (""C1 does not hold"") true.

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Initially, event1 has already happened (at the initial state).
2. The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events can occur in any subsequent state.
3. Therefore in the next state no events can occur, so event1 does not happen in the next state. Hence C1 is false.
4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.
5. The rule about event2 is irrelevant: event2 cannot occur after event1 (no events allowed), and it couldn’t have occurred before since event1 already happened initially.

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. Initial condition: event2 happened (so we are in a state where event2 has just occurred).
2. Rules: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. Thus any state following event2 is terminal — no further events (including event1) can occur.
3. C1 is just ""event1 happens"" (the disjunction ""event1 or event1"" is equivalent to event1).
4. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state — i.e., event1 happens in the next state.
5. But since after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately after the current one, Event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event2 happened (so at the initial state Event2 is true and Event1 is not).
- After Event1, no other events can happen (if Event1 ever occurs, that state is terminal).
- After Event2, no other events can happen (the state after Event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The initial state has Event2 and, by the last condition, is terminal: there is no next state.
- Event1 never occurs in the initial state, and there is no transition to any state where Event1 could occur.

Step 4 — determine C2
- C1 (""Event1 happens"") is false in the initial state.
- C2 requires C1 to hold in the next state, but there is no next state (so C1 does not hold in a next state).
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C1 and C2 mean:
- C1 is just ""event1 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event1 holds in the immediate successor state.

Step 2 — facts from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → there is no successor state after the state where event2 occurred.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Since there is no next state after the state with event2, the “next” condition cannot be satisfied. In standard temporal semantics, a next-state formula is false when no successor exists.

Therefore C2 is False."

Step 1 — what's asked:
We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, then event2 must follow).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine C1:
C1 states ""Event1 happens in the next state."" But since event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
C2 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Because C1 is false, the conjunction is false (regardless of event2's status).

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially, by Rule B no further events can occur after that initial state. Therefore event1 cannot occur in the next state (C1 is false).
- Even though event2 did happen initially, C2 requires both C1 and event2. Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 is required).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — no events can occur after any occurrence of event2).

Step 3 — examine consequences
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids any events from occurring after that initial state.
- In particular, event1 cannot occur in the next state (so C1 is false).
- If C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (C1 and event2 happens) cannot be true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (relative to the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, C1 is true, which means event1 happens in the state after the next (two steps from the initial state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (state0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so state1 must have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state2 must have event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- state0: event2 (given).
- state1: event1 (by ""after event2, event1 must happen"") — so C1 is true in the initial state.
- state2: event2 (by ""after event1, event2 must happen"").

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in state1, i.e. that event1 happens in state2. But state2 has event2, not event1. Thus C1 is false in state1, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time 1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — interpreted as: in the next state (time 1), C1 is true; equivalently, event1 happens in the state after next (time 2). So C2 means ""event1 happens at time 2"" (XX event1).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially (time 0): event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 at time t, event1 at t+1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 at t, event2 at t+1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Time 0: event2 (given).
- Time 1: by ""after event2 → event1"", event1 must happen. So C1 (event1 at time 1) is true.
- Time 2: by ""after event1 → event2"" from time 1, event2 must happen at time 2. So event1 does NOT happen at time 2. Therefore C1 does not hold at time 1 (i.e., at time 1 it is false that event1 will happen at time 2).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 asserts that at time 1, C1 holds (i.e., event1 at time 2). But we found event2 must occur at time 2, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, it is true that event1 happens in that state's next state)

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially (state0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so state1 must have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state2 must have event2), and so on, forcing an alternating sequence: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 from the initial state:
- C1 at state0: ""Event1 happens in the next state (state1)"" — true, because state1 has event1.
- C2 at state0: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means evaluate C1 at state1. C1 at state1 would assert ""Event1 happens in state2"", but state2 has event2, not event1 — so C1 is false at state1. Therefore C2 is false at state0.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
You must decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" As a logical implication (p → p) this is always true. Also, given the system rules: event2 → event1 → event2, any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1 and then by event2 again, so event2 does indeed occur (again). Thus C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what's asked
You ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A); it is always true regardless of the event dynamics.

Step 3 — use the context (consistency check)
The context (initial event2; event1 → event2; event2 → event1) does not invalidate the tautology; in fact it implies mutual occurrence but that is irrelevant to the truth of C1.

Conclusion
C1 holds, so the statement ""C1 does not hold"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false.

Examine each condition:
- Context constraints: initially event2 happened; event1 implies (later) event2; event2 implies (later) event1. These make event2 occur initially and force an alternating sequence thereafter, but that detail isn't needed for the logical form of C1.
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That's a proposition of the form p -> p, which is a tautology (always true whenever ""event2 happens"" is a well-formed proposition).

Since C1 is true, the statement C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in all possible executions/timelines, both events occur).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur at the start.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That forbids any event occurring at a later time than event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That forbids any event occurring at a later time than event1.

Step 3 — Examine possible orders
- If event1 happened before event2, then ""after event1 no other events can happen"" would prevent event2 from happening afterward. But we are told event2 did happen initially, so event1 cannot have happened before event2.
- If event2 happened before event1, then ""after event2 no other events can happen"" prevents event1 afterward. So event1 cannot happen after event2.
- Simultaneous occurrence would be needed for both to hold without violating an ""after"" constraint. But the statements use ""after"" which rules out a strict temporal ordering; allowing simultaneity would be an extra assumption not given. Under the standard reading (strict temporal order), there is no timeline where both events occur.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- There is no consistent timeline in which both event2 and event1 occur. Therefore C1 is not true in any execution, and so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible execution, both event2 and event1 happen).
We must decide if C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 occurs at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, the execution is terminal; no further events can occur.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (This also makes event1 terminal if it were to occur.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event2 already happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen after that.
- There is no information allowing event1 to have happened before event2; the statement says event2 happened initially, so event1 is not guaranteed to have happened at any time.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""both event2 and event1 happen"") is not guaranteed and in fact cannot hold given the initial event2 and its terminal effect.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in the situation).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward.
- The clause ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur given the prior clause.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Event2 did happen.
- Event1 cannot happen (because it would have to occur after event2, but no events can occur after event2).

Step 4 — evaluate hypothesis:
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to happen; since event1 does not happen, C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to a single occurrence of event2).
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" as well (event2 ∧ event2 ∧ event2 simplifies to event2).
So the question reduces to: does event2 happen given the context?

Step 2 — Examine context conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. That places event1 at the initial/earliest time.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, there can be no further events.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This would require event1 to occur following any event2.)

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Since event1 occurs initially (at the start), there is no opportunity for any event after it (by the second sentence). Thus event2 cannot occur after event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before event1? That would require an event earlier than the initial event1. ""Initially, event1 happened"" fixes event1 as the initial event; there are no earlier events. Therefore event2 cannot have happened before.
- The clause ""after event2, event1 must happen"" does not create a way for event2 to happen; it only constrains that if event2 ever happened, event1 must follow, but event1 already is initial and disallows later events.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- Event2 cannot occur given the context. Therefore C2 (which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens). C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". So C2 essentially asserts ""event2 happens"".

Step 2 — interpret the context constraints
- Initially, event1 happened. That fixes event1 as occurring at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen. This only constrains sequences where event2 occurs (it would require event1 afterward), but it does not enable event2 to occur before event1.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
Because event1 has already happened initially, and no events can happen after event1, there is no time or place for event2 to occur. There is no earlier time when event2 could have occurred because event1 is the initial event.

Step 4 — conclusion
Event2 cannot happen under the given constraints, so C1 is false and therefore C2 (which requires event2) is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — logically equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (redundant conjunctions).

So C2 is true exactly when event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Event2 cannot happen under the given context, so C2 (which requires event2) cannot be satisfied.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" i.e. at every point in time, C1 is true (from that point onward, event2 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Trace possible event sequence
- Given the constraints, the only possible sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 → no further events.
- So event2 occurs initially but does not occur again after event1 (because no events can occur after event1).

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true at the initial point (event2 has happened).
- C2 requires C1 to hold at every point. But after event1 (a reachable point), no further events can happen, so from that point event2 will not eventually happen — C1 is false there.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — read as a temporal/future claim: from the current point, event2 will occur at some future time (or already at the current time counts as occurred).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — read as the temporal formula ""always (eventually event2)"" (G F event2): at every point in every execution, event2 will happen at some later time.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the start of execution event2 has already occurred).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible execution
- Because event2 has happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur at some point.
- Once event1 occurs, no further events are possible (so there is a state after event1 in which no future event occurs).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 holds at the start (event2 has already occurred), so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 (always eventually event2) requires that at every future point event2 will still occur later. But after event1 has occurred, no further events can happen, so from that point event2 will not occur in the future. Therefore C1 does not hold at that post-event1 state, so ""always eventually event2"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (there is a future point at which event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (at every point in time, it is true that event2 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so C1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after that).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible execution
- Timeline: initially event2 (so C1 true now) → then event1 (must happen) → no further events possible.
- At states after event1, there is no future occurrence of any event, so ""event2 eventually happens"" is false at those states.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold at every point in time. We have a reachable point (after event1) where C1 is false. Therefore C2 does not hold.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 states ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens.""

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- The context says that after event2, event1 must happen. So whenever event2 happens, event1 happens.
- Therefore C1 (i.e., event1 happens) holds whenever event2 happens. In the actual scenario, event2 did happen and so event1 does happen.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" (equivalent to: event1 happens).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., if event2 happens, then event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant to the conditional except to show event1 does occur and is final).

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- From the context, because event2 happened and after event2 event1 must happen, event1 does happen. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The context establishes that whenever event2 happens, event1 happens. Therefore the implication ""if event2 happens, then C1 (event1 happens)"" holds. Given event2 does happen in the context and C1 is true, C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"".

Step 2 — apply the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The context says: after event2, event1 must happen. That guarantees event1 occurs whenever event2 occurs.
- The fact that after event1 no other events can happen doesn't prevent event1 from occurring; it only limits events after event1.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Given the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", whenever event2 happens, event1 indeed happens, so C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future time the statement ""event2 eventually happens"" becomes true).
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial time event1 has already occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so at any time after the initial time, no events occur).
- (The clause ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant once event2 never occurs, but it would likewise forbid events after event2.)

Step 3 — reason about event2 and C1
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen at any future time.
- Therefore the statement C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false at the initial time and will remain false.

Step 4 — reason about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 will become true at some future time. But since no events occur after the initial time, C1 cannot become true later.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. ""Eventually, it will be true that event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Since event1 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" means no events can occur at any later time. There is no earlier time before the initial state for event2 to have occurred, and nothing indicates event2 happened at the same initial moment.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 says ""eventually C1 holds."" Because C1 is never true, C2 is also false.
- (Note: in temporal logic, ""eventually eventually P"" collapses to ""eventually P"", but since P (event2) never occurs, both are false.)

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:
1. Hypothesis C1 says “event2 eventually happens.” C2 says “C1 eventually holds” (i.e., at some future time it becomes true that event2 will eventually happen).
2. Context facts: initially event1 happened. Also, “after event1, no other events can happen.” So once event1 has occurred (and it already has), no further events—including event2—can ever occur.
3. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any future time, so C1 is false.
4. Since C1 is never true, it cannot become true at any future time, so C2 is also false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We need to determine whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → since event1 did happen, event2 must happen at some later time.
- After event2, event1 must happen → they alternate, so event2 does indeed occur (and will occur repeatedly).

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is logically equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"", C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens or Event2 happens"", i.e. just ""Event2 happens"".

Step 4 — Combine context and conditions
- From the context we concluded event2 does happen (it must occur after the initial event1), so the proposition ""Event2 happens"" is true.

Final answer
True

Step 1 — Identify the question:
- We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 occurs (at least once after that initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → events alternate thereafter, so event2 does indeed occur.

Step 3 — Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to simply ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens,"" C2 simplifies to ""Event2 happens.""

Step 4 — Combine context and conditions:
- The context guarantees that event2 happens. Therefore the statement ""Event2 happens"" is true, hence C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (A ∧ A ≡ A).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Substituting C1 gives C2 ≡ (Event2) ∨ (Event2) which is just ""Event2 happens.""

Trace the event sequence from the context
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- The context states: after Event1, Event2 must happen. Therefore Event2 does happen (at least once).
- (After that Event2, Event1 must happen, and they alternate; that only reinforces that Event2 does occur.)

Conclusion
- Since Event2 happens, C2 (which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"") is True.

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""  
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no events — including event1 — can occur later).
- Also, after event1, no other events can happen (not directly used because event1 does not occur).

Step 3 — Evaluate C1
- The ""next state"" is the state immediately after the initial one. Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2 = (C1) OR (event1 happens)
- C1 is false (see above).
- ""Event1 happens"" — neither happened initially (initially event2 happened) nor can it happen later (after event2 no events can happen). So this disjunct is also false.
- Therefore the disjunction C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:

Step 2 — understand the given conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible events:
- The initial situation already has event2 happen.
- Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" once event2 has happened there can be no further occurrence of any events (including event1).
- Therefore there is no next state in which event1 can occur (event1 cannot happen next or at any later point).

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- The disjunction C2 = (C1) ∨ (event1 happens) is false because neither disjunct is true (event1 does not happen at all).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- The rules produce an alternating sequence: event2 (initially), then event1, then event2, then event1, ...
- C1 is true at the moments when event2 occurs but false at the moments when event1 occurs.
- Since C1 is not true at all times, ""C1 always holds"" is false.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 asserts ""C1 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially: event2 occurs at time t0.
- Rule A: after event2, event1 must occur (so at the next step after any event2, event1 holds).
- Rule B: after event1, event2 must occur (so at the next step after any event1, event2 holds).

These rules produce an alternating sequence of events: event2 (t0) → event1 (t1) → event2 (t2) → event1 (t3) → …

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1 is just ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e. event2 holds at the considered moment). 
- C2 says this C1 (i.e. event2) holds always (at every time point).

Step 4 — decide
- In the alternating trace, there are times (e.g. t1, t3, ...) when event1 holds. At those times event2 does not necessarily hold. Therefore event2 does not hold at all times, so C1 does not always hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just a redundant way of saying ""Event2 happens"" (C1 is true at moments when event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — asserts that Event2 holds at all times (globally).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So the system forces an alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

Step 3 — trace event sequence and test ""always C1""
- Event2 does occur (initially and repeatedly thereafter).
- But immediately after an event2, event1 must occur; at that time instant/event, event2 is not occurring, so C1 is false at that moment.
- Since there are moments (e.g., when event1 happens) where event2 does not hold, C1 is not true at all times.

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — i.e., (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens).

Initially event1 happened, and the rules require that after event1, event2 must happen (and then event1 must happen after event2, etc.). Therefore event2 does happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false (it asserts event2 does not happen, but event2 must and does happen).
- C2 is a conjunction that requires C1 to be true and event2 to happen; since C1 is false, C2 is false. Also C2 would be self-contradictory (asserting both ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens"").

Final answer: False

You ask whether C2 is True or False.

1) What the hypothesis asks: C2 is the statement ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is ""event2 does not happen.""

2) From the context: event1 happened initially and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 does happen.

3) Evaluate C1: C1 asserts event2 does not happen, but event2 does happen, so C1 is false.

4) Evaluate C2: C2 = (C1) AND (event2 happens) = (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens), which is a direct contradiction and therefore false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""
- C1 is ""Event2 does not happen.""
So C2 = (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- From the context, event1 initially happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 does in fact happen.
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") therefore is false.

Step 3 — logical contradiction:
- C2 asserts both ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens"" simultaneously, which is impossible.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (given).
- After event1, event2 must happen (obligation).
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequence:
- Given event1 occurred, the rule forces event2 to occur next; then nothing else can happen. So in every possible future consistent with the context, event2 occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true in this context because event2 is forced after the given initial event1 and thus occurs in all possible futures.
- Since C1 holds and event2 does indeed happen, the conjunction C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — parse the context and conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen — i.e. event2 necessarily follows event1.
- After event2, no other events can happen — event2 is terminal.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and event2
- From the context, because event1 already happened and event2 is required to follow event1, event2 will indeed occur.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is satisfied in this scenario (event2 necessarily happens after the initial event1).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Both conjuncts are true as just argued.

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does occur in this scenario.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to whether event2 happens).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - Given event1 did happen and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 is guaranteed in this scenario. Thus C1 (that event2 happens) is satisfied here.

4. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 requires both that C1 holds (true) and that event2 happens (also true). Both parts are satisfied.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., C1 ∨ event1)

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially (current state s0) event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ⇒ in the next state s1, event1 holds.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" ⇒ in s2, event2 holds, and so on (they alternate).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false: the next state s1 has event1, not event2.
- But event1 does happen (in s1), so the disjunction C1 ∨ event1 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., C2 = C1 ∨ event1)

Step 2 — use the context rules to trace states:
- Initially (state S0) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → in S1 event1 occurs.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → in S2 event2 occurs.
- So states alternate: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, …

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial point:
- C1 at S0 asks whether event2 happens in the next state (S1). In S1 event1 happens, not event2, so C1 is false.
- C2 = (C1) or (event1). Although C1 is false, event1 does happen in the next state (S1), so the second disjunct is true; therefore C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — given facts
- Initially event2 happened (call that state s0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state s1, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so s2 will have event2, and so on).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From s0 the next state s1 has event1 (by the rule after event2), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Even though C1 is false, event1 does happen in the next state (s1), so the disjunction is true.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the context:

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means event1 has already occurred at the initial time.
- ""Eventually happens"" is satisfied by an event that has occurred already (it occurs at some time).
- Therefore C1 is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event2 holds at all times / in all reachable situations).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later time.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypotheses:
- C1 (event2 happens) is false in the given scenario.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""Event1 always happens.""

Step 2 — understand the rules:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (at least once) after that initial event2.
- That in turn forces event2 again, and so on, giving an alternating sequence event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Therefore event1 does occur (it happens after the initial event2).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false: at the initial moment event1 did not happen (initially event2 happened), so event1 is not true at every moment.
- But the disjunction in C2 is satisfied because ""Event1 happens"" is true (event1 does occur after the initial event2). So C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- Determine the truth of C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (call that time 0).
- Rule A: after event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs at time 1).
- Rule B: after event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs at time 2), and so on — they alternate.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false because at time 0 event1 did not happen (event2 did), so event1 is not true at every time.
- ""Event1 happens"" (the left disjunct of C2) is true because, by the rules, event1 does occur (immediately after the initial event2).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since ""Event1 happens"" is true, C2 is true (even though C1 is false).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions

- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur next).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate thereafter).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event2 (given).
- By the rule ""after event2 → event1"", event1 must happen (in the next step).
- Thus ""Event1 happens"" is satisfied (it does occur).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction: ""Event1 happens OR C1 holds.""
- Since ""Event1 happens"" is true, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether C1 (""Event1 always happens"") holds.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 holds in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events/states).
- After event2, event1 must happen (this only constrains behavior if event2 ever occurs).

Trace possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no subsequent states at all. In particular, there is no “next state” in which event1 could happen.
- The clause ""after event2, event1 must happen"" doesn’t force event2 to occur and is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1 (no events can occur after event1).

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (there is no next state where event1 happens).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so the current/initial state has just had event1).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" This makes event1 terminal: once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events can occur in following states.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This rule is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1 (no events can occur after event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event1 occurred initially and no events can occur after event1, the next state cannot contain any event, in particular it cannot contain event1.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event1 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so the current/initial state has event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, it forces event1 afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events).

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Because event1 already happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events can occur after the initial state. In particular, event2 cannot occur in any later state.
- Since no events can occur after the initial event1, event1 does not occur again in the next state.
- The obligation ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (Event1 does not happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true)

Step 2 — given conditions
- Initially (now) event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So from now on, no events occur.)
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- From the initial state, C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state. But since after event2 no events can happen, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false at the initial state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. That means: in the next state, ""event1 happens in the following state"" should be true. But because no events can happen after event2, event1 does not occur at any future state, so C1 is false in the next state as well. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, so the ""next state"" is the state after event2.
- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 cannot happen in that next state.
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; since C1 is false there, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (relative to the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, the formula C1 is true (so event1 would happen in the state after that).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (current state S0) event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So from S0 there are no future states where any event occurs (in particular, event1 cannot occur after S0).
- Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is given but irrelevant because event1 does not occur here.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 at the initial state
- C1 asserts event1 occurs in the next state (S1). But since no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur in S1. Therefore C1 is false at S0.

Step 4 — evaluate C2 at the initial state
- C2 says that in the next state (S1), C1 is true — i.e., in S1 event1 occurs in the following state (S2).
- But again no events can happen after event2, so in S1 no events occur, so C1 is false in S1. Hence C2 is false at S0.
- (If there is no next state at all, next-state formulas are not satisfied, so C2 is still false.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether the compound statement C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and C1
- Context: initially event1 happened.
- Context: after event1, event2 must happen. That establishes that whenever event1 happens, event2 happens.
- C1 states: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" The context directly supports C1, so C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the disjunction: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
- From the context, event2 does in fact happen (it must happen after event1, and event1 did happen). Also C1 holds. Either way, the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C2 asserts the disjunction ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So if event1 occurs, event2 will occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Because event1 happened and event2 must follow event1, event2 does indeed happen. Also, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is exactly the content of C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""), so C1 is true as well.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
C2 is ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.
We are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened (so ""event1 happens"" is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so ""event2 happens"" is true).
- After event2 no other events can happen (irrelevant to C2).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because its antecedent (event1) is true and its consequent (event2) is true.
- C2 is a disjunction; since ""event2 happens"" is true, C2 is true (the second disjunct C1 is also true, but only one true disjunct is needed).

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (meaning: event1 holds in every relevant moment/state)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At the initial moment event2 happened. By the rule, next event1 happens, then event2, then event1, etc. So the run alternates: event2 (initial), event1, event2, event1, ...
- Crucially, at the initial moment event1 did not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false, because there is at least one moment (the initial moment) where event1 did not happen.
- C2 asserts that whenever event2 happens, C1 holds. But event2 does happen (initially) while C1 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning step by step:

- Timeline: at t0, event2 happens (given).
- From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we get event1 at some later time (t1).
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get event2 at t2, and so on — they alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""holds at every time point,"" C1 is false (event1 does not hold at t0).
- C2 says ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" But event2 does happen (at t0) while C1 is false, so the implication is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (interpreted as: at all future points, event2 occurs — i.e., globally/always.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., starting from the next state, C1 is true.)

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next event is event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the execution ends after event1).

Step 3 — trace possible sequence
- Sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 → no more events.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false: event2 occurs at the initial state but does not occur at the subsequent state(s) (event1 occurs next and then nothing), so event2 is not true at all future points.
- C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is already false (and in the next state event2 does not occur at all in the future), C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every state/time point event2 holds).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at the immediate next state, it is true that event2 always happens).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 holds at the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state must have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, no further events occur thereafter).

Step 3 — trace possible sequence:
- t0: event2 occurs (given).
- t1: event1 must occur (because it must follow event2).
- t2 and onward: no events can happen (because after event1 no other events can happen). In particular, event2 does not occur at t1 or any later time.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false: event2 does not occur at t1 or later.
- C2 claims that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., at t1). Since C1 is false at t1, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is asked: C2 asserts that C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true in the next state. We must decide whether that claim holds given the context.

2. Interpretations (standard temporal reading):
   - ""Event2 always happens"" means at every state from the reference point forward (i.e., globally), event2 occurs.
   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means immediately after event2 (or at least next) event1 occurs.
   - ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means event1 is terminal — no further events occur after it.

3. Trace the possible sequence from the initial condition:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state contains event1.
   - By the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"", there are no further events after that.

4. Evaluate C1 in the next state:
   - In the next state event1 has happened and no further events occur, so event2 does not hold at that next state nor afterwards.
   - Therefore the statement ""Event2 always happens"" is false when evaluated from the next state.

So C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The hypothesis C1 is: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
2. From the context we know event2 happened initially, and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So event1 cannot occur at any time because event2 already happened first.
3. An implication ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is true whenever the antecedent (event1 happens) never holds — i.e., it is vacuously true. Also here event2 actually did happen initially, so any case with event1 (which doesn't occur) would still satisfy C1.
4. Therefore C1 holds given the context. C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, so C2 is false.
---
Reasoning:

- The system starts with event2 having already happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so no event (including event1) can occur after that initial event2.
- Could event1 have happened before the initial event2? No: the statement ""initially, event2 happened"" fixes event2 as the starting occurrence; any occurrence of event1 before that would contradict the initial condition. Also, if event1 did happen before event2, then by ""after event1, no other events can happen"" event2 could not happen afterward, contradicting the initial event2.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen in any permissible timeline.

Since the antecedent ""event1 happens"" never holds, the implication ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is vacuously true. Thus C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis asks about C2, which asserts ""C1 does not hold."" So we must decide whether C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is false.
- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. That means event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no time after the initial event2 when event1 could happen).
- Since event1 cannot occur, the conditional ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is vacuously true (an implication with an impossible antecedent holds).
- Therefore C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So Event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 happens too).
- After event1, no other events can happen — no contradiction with event2 having happened initially.

Step 3 — conclude:

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- Therefore C2 is the negation: ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 3 — trace the context:
- The context states that initially event2 happened. So event2 did happen (hence C1 holds).
- The further rules (event1 must happen after event2, and nothing can happen after event1) do not contradict the fact that event2 happened.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Answer: True

Brief justification:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees event2 will occur.
- Thus both event1 and event2 happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since event2 happens (and C1 holds), that disjunction is true.
---
Step-by-step:

1. Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
2. The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means that because event1 happened, event2 will happen (at some later time). So event2 is true.
3. Therefore C1 (""event1 happens and event2 happens"") is true.
4. C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" which is logically equivalent to just ""event2 happens"". Since event2 is true, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event2 happens).

Step 2 — simplify the hypothesis:
- C2 = (event1 AND event2) OR event2 = event2. (Because P∧Q ∨ Q is equivalent to Q.)

Step 3 — examine the context and trace events:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies event2 will occur (after the initial event1).
- Therefore event2 does happen. (The other rule, after event2 event1 must happen, only reinforces that both can recur, but is unnecessary to conclude event2 occurs.)

Step 4 — conclude:
- Since event2 occurs, C2 (equivalent to event2) is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether C2 (""Event2 always happens"" and ""event1 happens"") follows from the context.

Step-by-step:
- From ""Initially, event2 happened"" we know event2 happened at the start, but this does not imply it happens at all times or in every situation. So C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not supported.
- From ""After event2, event1 must happen"" and the fact event2 did happen initially, we can conclude event1 will happen.
- C2 is the conjunction of C1 and ""event1 happens"". Although the second conjunct is true from the context, the first conjunct (C1) is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning summary:
- The context guarantees event2 happened initially, and because ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur. After event1 no further events occur.
- C1 asserts ""Event2 always happens."" The context only gives that event2 happened initially; it does not justify the stronger claim that event2 happens in all cases/times.
- C2 requires both C1 and that event1 happens. While event1 does happen, C1 is not established, so C2 does not hold.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether hypothesis C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context gives: (a) Initially, event2 happened. (b) After event2, event1 must happen. (c) After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1 states: ""Event2 always happens."" That is a universal claim beyond the single scenario described.
- C2 states: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""

Step 3 — trace and reason
- From (a) and (b), in the described scenario event1 does happen (event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen). So the conjunct ""event1 happens"" is true.
- However, nothing in the context says event2 happens in every possible case; we only know event2 happened in this initial/actual scenario. So ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is not supported by the context and cannot be concluded true.

Step 4 — final determination
- C2 requires both C1 and ""event1 happens"". C1 is not supported (false), so C2 is false (false AND true = false).

Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""

Examine the context:
- Initially Event2 happened (so Event2 has occurred).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so Event1 will occur).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen, and so on (they alternate).

Trace consequences:
- C1 is true because Event2 has already happened (so the disjunction holds).
- Event1 will happen (given the ""after Event2"" requirement), so the first conjunct of C2 is satisfied.
- Since C1 holds and Event1 will happen, both parts of C2 are satisfied.

Conclusion: True

- C1: Event2 happens or Event1 happens.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so Event1 does happen at some point after the initial Event2).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (this creates a repeating alternation but does not prevent Event1 from occurring).

Step 3 — trace events:
- Since Event2 initially happened and ""after Event2, Event1 must happen,"" Event1 does occur.
- Because Event1 occurs, C1 (""Event2 or Event1 happens"") is true (specifically because Event1 happens).
- Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is satisfied.

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C2 is true. C2 says ""C1 always holds.""
- C1 is the statement ""Event2 always happens.""

Examine the conditions:
1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, the run is terminal; no further events can occur.)
3. After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time, then later event1 must occur.)

Trace possible event sequences given the conditions:
- Because event1 happened initially, condition (2) prevents any other event from happening after that. Since event1 already occurred at the start, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any time in the run.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in this system (in any possible run starting from the given initial condition).

Evaluate the hypotheses:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false, because event2 never happens.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") asserts that C1 is true in all runs; since C1 is false, C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 asks whether C1 ""Event2 always happens"" holds in all executions.
- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So in the initial (and only) execution, event2 cannot occur after event1.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" only constrains what must follow if event2 occurs; it does not force event2 to occur.
- Therefore there is an execution (the initial one) where event2 does not happen, so C1 is false, and hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether statement C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So at the start, event1 has occurred.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal — once it has happened, no further events occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This claims event2 occurs (at all relevant times or in all runs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This claims that the statement C1 is always true.

Step 4 — reason about possible event sequences
Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any later time. There is no earlier time in which event2 could have happened (the initial fact fixes event1 as having happened at the start). Therefore event2 does not happen.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 asserts: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (both events occur in the same run).
- C2 asserts: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., there is (or will be) a point in the execution where both events have happened.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So the run already has event2 at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes any state reached after event2 terminal: no further events can occur.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (This would also make the run terminal if event1 occurs, but the crucial one is the one about event2.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event2 happened initially, the system is immediately in a state where no further events can happen (by the ""after event2"" rule).
- Therefore event1 cannot happen at any later time in the run.
- There is no indication event1 happened before the initial moment; the only given initial event is event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- It is impossible for both event1 and event2 to have happened in the same run given these constraints. Hence C1 cannot eventually hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C1 is the statement ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some time both event1 and event2 have happened.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred from the start.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That forbids any event (including event1) after event2.
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event1 cannot occur.)

Step 3 — can C1 ever hold?
- To have C1 true at any time we need both event1 and event2 to have occurred.
- Since event2 already occurred initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- There is no information that event1 also occurred initially; we cannot assume it did. Thus there is no time at which both have happened.

Conclusion:
C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
- C2 asks whether C1 ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" eventually holds.

Step 2 — what the context says
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.
- The only way for both event1 and event2 to be true would be if they could both occur in the same trace. But event2 already occurs initially and prevents any subsequent events, and if event1 had occurred first it would prevent event2 afterward. There is no allowed trace in which both events happen.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 never holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 is true or false.

1) What the hypothesis asks: C2 asserts ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is ""event2 does not happen."" So C2 is (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens).

2) Examine the conditions: The context says event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen (and after event1 no further events). So event2 does happen in the scenario.

3) Trace/logical reasoning:
- C1 asserts event2 does not happen, but the context says event2 did happen, so C1 is false.
- C2 requires both C1 true and event2 true, i.e. (¬event2) ∧ (event2), which is a direct contradiction and therefore cannot be true.

Final answer:
False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C2 is true.

- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" That is (event2 does not happen) AND (event2 happens) — a logical contradiction, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens).
- C1 asserts: event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The context also states ""Initially, event2 happened,"" so event2 does happen (at least initially).
- Independently, C1 says event2 does not happen, which contradicts the context.

Step 3 — logical analysis:
- C2 requires both ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens"" simultaneously, which is a direct contradiction and cannot be true.

Sample responses:
Hypothesis: C2 asserts ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" where C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

1. From the context: event1 did happen initially.
2. Also from the context: after event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterward.
3. For C1 (""if event1 then event2"") to hold given that event1 did happen, event2 would have to happen. But step 2 forbids event2 after event1.
4. Hence C1 cannot be true under the given conditions, and event2 does not happen.
5. Therefore C2 (""event2 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (event1 → event2)
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds. (event2 ∧ (event1 → event2))

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 did occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no event can occur at any time after that initial event1.

Step 3 — reason about consequences:
- Since event1 happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur after event1.
- Because event1 is the initial event, there is no earlier time at which event2 could have happened before event1. Thus event2 does not happen.
- C1 (event1 → event2) would require that because event1 happened, event2 must happen; but that contradicts the fact that no events can happen after event1 and event2 did not occur. Therefore C1 does not hold.
- Since C2 requires event2 to happen and C1 to hold, and neither is true, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
- The hypothesis C2 asserts two things: (a) C1 holds, where C1 is “if event1 happens, then event2 happens”; and (b) event2 happens. We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, no subsequent event can occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- Because event1 happens initially and forbids any later events, no event can occur after event1. Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- C1 (event1 → event2) would require event2 to occur when event1 occurs (or subsequently). That conflicts with “after event1, no other events can happen.” So C1 cannot be true in this context.
- Even ignoring C1, event2 is not true because the context prevents any events occurring after event1, and event1 has already occurred initially.

Conclusion
- C2 (which requires both C1 to hold and event2 to happen) is false.

Step 2 — examine the context:

- After event2, event1 must happen — so event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen — this only restricts events after event1; it does not prevent event1 itself.

Step 3 — trace the events:
- event2 occurs initially, then event1 must occur. Therefore event1 does occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:

Step 1 — identify the question:
- We are asked whether C2 is True or False.

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" therefore simplifies to ""Event1 happens and Event1 happens"", i.e. just ""Event1 happens"".

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate:
- Context says event2 happened initially and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Since event2 did happen, event1 must happen.
- The clause ""after event1, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event1 from happening.

The question asks whether C2 is true or false given the context.

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — since C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"", C2 simplifies to ""Event1 happens and Event1 happens"", i.e. simply ""Event1 happens"".

Step 3 — use the context
Context states: initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does happen.

Since event1 happens, C2 (which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"") is true.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

- Let s0 be the initial state. At s0 event1 has happened.
- By the context, after event1 (i.e. in s1) event2 must happen, so s1: event2 occurs.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so s2: no events (in particular, event1 does not occur at s2).
- C1 is ""event1 happens in the next state"" (at s1). Given s1 has event2 (and not event1), C1 is false at s0.
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at s1, C1 is true, which means event1 would have to occur at s2. But s2 has no events, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First, interpret the context and the two conditions precisely in terms of states:

- Let S0 be the initial state. In S0, event1 happened (given).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means the immediate next state S1 must have event2.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means after S1 (which has event2), no further events occur in S2 or later.

Now interpret the hypotheses:

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Evaluated in S0, C1 says “event1 happens in S1.”
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Evaluated in S0, C2 says “in S1, C1 is true,” i.e. in S1 the next state (S2) has event1.

Trace the sequence under the context:

- S0: event1 occurred.
- S1: must have event2 (by the rule after event1).
- After event2 (i.e. after S1) no other events can happen, so S2 has no events — in particular, event1 does not occur in S2.

Evaluate C1 and C2:

- C1 at S0 (does event1 happen in S1?): No — S1 has event2, not event1. So C1 is false in S0.
- C2 at S0 (does C1 hold in S1?): C1 in S1 asserts that event1 happens in S2, but S2 has no events. So C1 is false in S1, therefore C2 is false in S0.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and hypotheses clearly
- Context:
  1. Initially, event1 happened.
  2. After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., event2 inevitably occurs following event1).
  3. After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Hypotheses:
  - C1: Event2 always happens. (Interpreted as: given the context, event2 does occur.)
  - C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds (i.e., event1 has happened and event2 does occur).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- Initially event1 has already happened (given).
- Because after event1 event2 must happen, event2 will occur after that.
- The fact that no events can happen after event2 does not prevent event2 from occurring; it only forbids any events after it.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true: event2 does happen (it must happen after the given initial event1).
- C2 is true: event1 happened (given) and C1 holds (just shown).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
The hypothesis C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" (with C1 being ""Event2 always happens""). You ask whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That forces event2 to occur (because event1 did occur).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That just says event2 is terminal; it doesn't prevent event2 from occurring.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): given that event1 happened and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will indeed happen in this scenario. So C1 holds.
- C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds""): event1 did happen initially, and C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true iff (i) event1 did happen, and (ii) event2 always happens.

Examine premises:
1. Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred.
2. After event1, event2 must happen. Given event1 has happened, this forces event2 to occur (in every allowed future).
3. After event2, no other events can happen. This only limits events after event2; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.

Reasoning:
- From (1) and (2), event2 is inevitable: because event1 already happened and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 will occur in all possible continuations. That satisfies C1 (""Event2 always happens"").
- Event1 did happen (given), so the first part of C2 holds.
- Therefore both parts of C2 are true.

- Because event2 has happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 never happens at any time.
- Therefore the statement ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is false (event1 does not always happen), it cannot become true in the next state given the context; the facts prevent event1 from ever occurring.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step‑by‑step:
1. The hypothesis C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. at all relevant states/event steps).
2. The context says initially event2 happened, and ""after event2, no other events can happen.""
3. Because event2 already happened initially and no further events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at the initial or any later state.
4. Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not always happen).
5. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; since C1 is false, C2 is false as well.

So C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" implies no event1 can occur at any time after that initial event2.
- Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Since C1 is false, it cannot hold in the next state either, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- Rule 1: After event2, event1 must happen. So from the initial state there will be an event1 at some (next) time.
- Rule 2: After event1, event2 must happen. That only implies the events alternate, but does not prevent the first event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: event2 (given).
- By Rule 1: event1 will occur afterward. Therefore event1 eventually happens (C1 is true).
- Since event1 does indeed occur, the conjunct ""event1 happens"" in C2 is also true.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Both parts of C2 are satisfied, so C2 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So the system enforces an alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: event2 (given).
- By the rule, event1 must happen next.
- After that, event2 must happen, then event1 again, and so on.

Step 4 — evaluate the statements:
- C1 is true because event1 does occur (indeed infinitely often) in the enforced sequence.
- C2 is the conjunction of C1 and ""event1 happens."" Since event1 does happen (right after the initial event2), that conjunct is true as well. Therefore C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" (i.e., both that event1 will eventually happen and that event1 does happen.)

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At time 0: event2 happened.
- By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will occur at some later time (so event1 does happen).
- Then by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", they alternate indefinitely: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because event1 does occur (indeed it occurs repeatedly).
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event1 to happen; both are satisfied by the above sequence.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is true only if both C1 is true and event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred at the initial state.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur in any subsequent state.
- (The extra sentence ""After event2, no other events can happen."" only adds that event2 would also be terminal, but it doesn't change the fact that event1 already prevents further events.)

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
- Since event1 occurred initially and it forbids any further events, there cannot be an occurrence of event2 in the next state.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (which requires C1 to hold) is also false, even though event1 did happen.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""

We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- (Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — irrelevant unless event2 happens.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequence
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur in the next state (or at any later time).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false (event2 cannot happen next).
- C2 requires C1 to be true and event1 to have happened. Although event1 did happen, C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- The context states: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, there cannot be any further events in any later state.
- C1 asserts that event2 happens in the next state. But since event1 already happened initially and no further events can occur after event1, event2 cannot happen next.

- After event2, no other events can happen. (Redundant here unless event2 can occur.)

Step 3 — trace event possibilities:

- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state""): false.
- Conjunction (Event2 happens and C1): false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true iff both event2 happens and event1 happens in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the context:

- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened (which is true initially), no events can occur in any subsequent state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (This also makes event2 terminal, but it's irrelevant because event1 already occurred initially.)

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, nothing can occur in the next state. Therefore C1 (event1 happens in the next state) is false.
- Since no events can occur after the initial event1, event2 cannot happen either. Thus ""event2 happens"" is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires both event2 happens and C1. Both are false, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens AND C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has already occurred at the start.
- Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2 or another occurrence of event1) can occur in any subsequent state.
- Therefore:
  - Event2 cannot happen (because it would be a further event after event1).
  - Event1 cannot happen in the next state (because no events can occur after the initial event1).
- Since both conjuncts of C2 fail, C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"", where C1 = ""event2 happens and event1 happens"".
- So we must check whether, in the state immediately after the initial state, both event2 and event1 hold.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so the initial state has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no transitions producing new events are possible after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must follow it).

Step 3 — reasoning about possible next state
- Since event2 has already happened initially and ""after event2 no other events can happen"", there is no state reachable in which a new event (such as event1) occurs after the initial state.
- Therefore the next state cannot contain event1 (and in fact there is no successor state that can introduce new events).
- Thus C1 (""event2 and event1 happen"") cannot hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- Hypothesis: C1 is the statement ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" C2 is the claim ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state after the initial one).

- From the context:
  1. Initially, event2 has happened.
  2. After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there can be no later occurrence of event1).
  3. If event1 happens, event2 must (subsequently) happen.

- Can C1 be true at all? C1 requires both event2 and event1 to have happened. We know event2 has happened initially. But event1 cannot happen after that (rule 2). There is no information that event1 happened before the initial state, and the usual reading of ""Initially, event2 happened"" rules out a prior event1. So C1 is false in the initial state.

- In the next state there are no new events (since no events can happen after event2). Therefore event1 still has not happened, so C1 is still false in the next state.

- Thus C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initially, event2 happened. So in the initial state event2 is true.
2. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means in every state following the initial (and including any subsequent states) no new events can occur. In particular, event1 cannot occur after the initial state.
3. There is no statement saying event1 already happened in the initial state. The only guaranteed event is event2 initially.
4. Therefore C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is not satisfied in the initial state (event1 does not happen), and cannot be satisfied in any later state (no events can occur after event2).
5. C2 states that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is false now and cannot become true later, C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens and event1 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (i.e., C1 ∧ event1).

Step 2 — Understand the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 forces a subsequent event2).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 forces a subsequent event1).

Step 3 — Trace the event sequence:
- Initially event1 has occurred (given).
- By Rule A, because event1 occurred, event2 must occur sometime after.
- Once event2 occurs, by Rule B, event1 must occur again sometime after.
- Thus both event1 and event2 occur (event1 at least initially, event2 at least once, and event1 again).

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event2 happens and event1 happens) is satisfied: event1 happened initially and event2 is forced to happen.
- C2 = C1 ∧ event1: since C1 is true and event1 does occur (indeed at least once), C2 is also satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (Event2 happens and Event1 happens) and Event1 happens. (Equivalently, C1 and Event1.)

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, Event1 happened (so Event1 occurs at least once).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so an Event2 follows that initial Event1).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so an Event1 follows that Event2).
These rules imply Event1 and Event2 occur (and in fact will alternate).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At time 0: Event1 (given).
- By ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"": at some later time Event2 occurs.
- By ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"": at some later time Event1 occurs again.
Thus Event1 and Event2 both occur (and Event1 occurs at least once).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 (""Event2 happens and Event1 happens"") is true from the sequence.
- C2 is C1 and Event1 happens; Event1 does happen (indeed it happens initially and again), so C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- Rule A: after event1, event2 must happen (so from any occurrence of event1, a later event2 is required).
- Rule B: after event2, event1 must happen (so from any occurrence of event2, a later event1 is required).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Initially event1 happened (given).
- By Rule A, because event1 happened, event2 must happen afterward. So event2 happens.
- By Rule B, because event2 happens, event1 must happen afterward. So event1 happens (again).
- At this point both event1 and event2 have happened, so C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"". C1 holds, and event1 indeed happens (initially and again), so C2 is true.

True

Brief justification: The context forces event1 to occur (event2 happens initially and mandates event1 afterward), and nothing can prevent or remove that fact later. So C1 is true in every execution, hence the statement ""C1 always holds"" is also true.

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so every execution starts with event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any execution that has event2 will have event1 next).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the initial fact and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 does indeed occur in every execution of the system described. So C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This is asking whether C1 is guaranteed by the context. Since C1 follows from the context, C2 is true.

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the claim: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — Examine conditions from the context:
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So ""Event2 happens"" is true.
- C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen,"" which contradicts the context, so C1 is false.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 is a conjunction: (Event2 happens) AND (Event2 does not happen).
- A conjunction with one true and one false conjunct is false.

Therefore C2 is False.

- Also: after event2, no other events can happen; after event1, no other events can happen. (These forbid further events once either event occurs, but do not change the fact that event2 occurred initially.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") contradicts the context statement that event2 initially happened. Therefore C1 is false in the given context.
- C2 asserts ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — i.e., ""event2 happens and event2 does not happen."" That is a direct contradiction; since C1 is false, the conjunction is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C2 (the conjunction ""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 were to occur, event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, no events (including event1 again or event2) can occur in any subsequent state.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false — event1 cannot occur in the next state.
- Event2 cannot occur either, because it would be an event after event1, which is forbidden.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires both C1 and event2 to be true. Both are impossible under the context (C1 is false and event2 cannot occur), so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Brief reasoning (concise, non-sensitive):
1. Context: initially event1 has already happened. Rule A: once event1 has happened, no further events can occur. Rule B: if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.
2. From Rule A and the initial fact, no events (including event2) can occur after the initial state.
3. C1 asserts event1 occurs in the next state — but no events can occur after the initial state, so C1 is false.
4. C2 requires C1 to hold and event2 to happen; since C1 is false (and event2 cannot occur), C2 is false.
---
First, what is being asked:
- C2 asks whether ""Event1 happens in the next state (C1) and event2 happens"" can both hold given the context.

Examine the context and consequences:
1. Initially, event1 happened. So the starting state already has event1.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred (as it did initially), no further events can occur in any future state — in particular, event2 cannot occur after that point.
3. ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (from point 2), so the implication never becomes active.

Now check the hypothesis:
- C1 (event1 happens in the next state): Given (2), no events can occur after the initial event1, so event1 does not occur again in the next state. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 requires both C1 and event2 to happen. Even if there were an interpretation allowing event1 to reoccur, event2 is still forbidden by (2). So C2 cannot be satisfied.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the rules:
- Initially (state0): event1 holds.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means the state immediately following any state where event1 holds must have event2.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" similarly forces event1 in the state immediately after any state with event2.

Step 2 — trace states:
- state0: event1 (given).
- By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", state1 must have event2.
- Thus state1 has event2, not event1 (unless simultaneous occurrence were allowed, but nothing in the context says events co-occur; the natural reading is they occur in subsequent states).

Step 3 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 is just ""event1"" (event1 and event1 is redundant).
- C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state (i.e., event1 holds in state1).
- From the trace, state1 has event2, not event1, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the immediate next state, Event1 happens.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially (state 0): Event1 happened.
- Rule A: After Event1, Event2 must happen (so if Event1 occurs in a state, Event2 must occur in the next state).
- Rule B: After Event2, Event1 must happen (so if Event2 occurs in a state, Event1 must occur in the next state).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- State 0: Event1 (given).
- By Rule A, State 1 must have Event2.
- By Rule B, State 2 must have Event1.
Thus the next state (State 1) contains Event2, not Event1. Event1 returns in State 2, but that is not the immediate next state.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (Event1) does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event1 must hold in the immediate next state.

Step 2 — understand the conditions (assume ""after"" means in the immediate next state)
- Initially (state S0): event1 happens.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen → if event1 holds in some state, then event2 holds in the next state.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 holds in some state, then event1 holds in the next state.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- S0: event1 (given).
- By Rule A, S1 (the next state) must have event2.
- By Rule B, S2 must have event1, and so on alternating.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires event1 to hold in S1 (the next state). But S1 has event2, not event1.
- Therefore C2 is not satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the events
- Since event1 happened initially, by Rule A event2 must happen.
- Once event2 happens, by Rule B event1 must happen again, which by Rule A forces event2 again, and so on. So event2 does occur (and in fact recurs indefinitely under these rules).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): given the initial event1 and the rules, event2 inevitably occurs (and recurs), so C1 holds.
- C2 is the conjunction ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"": both conjuncts are true, so C2 is true.

Answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so from the initial event1, event2 will occur at some later point).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 happens, event1 will occur afterward).
These rules force alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 … so both events occur repeatedly, but not simultaneously or in every state.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as a global/“at all times” claim (i.e., event2 holds in every state) — this is false because there are states where event1 holds and event2 does not.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" We know event2 does happen (at least after the initial event1), but C2 requires C1 to hold as well. Since C1 is false, the conjunction is false.

Final answer
False
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 asserts (Event2 happens) AND (C1 holds), where C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Examine the context and rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so event2 will occur at least once (after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → they force an alternation (event1 → event2 → event1 → ...).

Interpretation and conclusion:
- If ""always"" in C1 is read in the natural, strong sense (""event2 holds at all times"" or ""at every time point""), C1 is false (there are times—e.g., the initial moment—when event1 occurs instead of event2). Therefore C2 (which requires C1) is false.
(If one instead read ""always"" as ""inevitably/recurring"" so event2 must occur at some future points, C1 would be true, but that is not the usual reading of ""always"".)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True.

Brief justification (concise):
- C1 asserts that event2 eventually happens. From ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 is guaranteed, so C1 is true.
- C2 asserts ""event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen (so C1 holds), C2 is also true.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (So C2 asserts event2 happens, and restates that event2 will eventually happen.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. That obligation means that because event1 did happen, event2 will occur at some later point — so event2 eventually happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That just restricts what follows event2; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- event1 has occurred.
- By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will occur at some point → C1 is satisfied.
- Since event2 does occur, the conjunct ""Event2 happens"" in C2 is satisfied, and C1 also holds (as shown). Thus C2 is satisfied.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens"".)

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So given event1 occurred, event2 is inevitable/required.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This only makes event2 terminal; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.)

Step 3 — Trace the sequence and evaluate:
- Since event1 has already happened and event2 must follow after event1, event2 will indeed happen (so C1 is true).
- Because event2 happens, the first conjunct of C2 (""Event2 happens"") is true, and C1 is true as shown.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true (it occurred).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" only constrains sequences where event2 occurs, irrelevant since we already have event1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means event1 is terminal, but it does not negate that event1 did happen initially.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore false.

- C1 = ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold."" The question: is C2 True or False?

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has happened (true).
- The other rules (after event2 → event1 must happen; after event1 → no other events) are irrelevant to C1 because event1 already occurred.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since event1 did happen, C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ¬(event1 ∨ event2) meaning neither event1 nor event2 happens.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen (at the initial time).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This imposes that if event2 were to happen, event1 would have to happen after it — but since event1 already happened initially and prevents any subsequent events, event2 cannot occur after event1. There is no indication event2 happened before the initial event1.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence and evaluate C1/C2:
- Because event1 happened initially, the disjunction in C1 (""event1 or event2"") is already satisfied. So C1 is true.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 is true, C2 is false.

- C1 = (if event2 happens then event2 happens).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1 is a tautology (p → p). So C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate whether event1 happens:
- The context states event2 happened initially and that after event2 no other events can happen. That prevents event1 from occurring after the initial event2.
- There is no statement that event1 occurred before the initial event2, so we have no basis to conclude event1 happens. Therefore event1 does not hold.

Step 4 — combine:
- C1 is true but event1 is false, so (event1 AND C1) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts two things: (a) event1 happens, and (b) C1 holds.
- C1 is the statement “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.”

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1 is a logical tautology (P → P). It is always true whenever the formula is interpreted, so C1 holds.
- The context facts:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then event2 must follow.)
  3. After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially, that is the earliest event. The rule “after event2, no other events can happen” prevents any events occurring after that initial event2.
- There is no information that event1 happened before the initial event2; “initially” means the start, so there is no earlier time for event1 to have occurred.
- Nothing forces event1 to have happened simultaneously or earlier; the context does not assert event1 occurs at all. Given the initial event2 and the prohibition on subsequent events, there is no consistent way to deduce that event1 happens.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 holds (tautology), but event1 does not follow from the given context. Therefore C2 (“event1 happens and C1 holds”) is not satisfied.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What is asked
The hypothesis C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens AND C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p); it is always true. So C1 holds.
- C2: requires that event1 happens (and C1, which we already know is true).

Step 3 — Use the context to see if event1 can happen
- The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened.""
- It also states: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 already happened initially, no other events (including event1) can occur at any later time.
- Nothing in the context says event1 happened before the initial event2; ""initially"" indicates the starting point, so there is no room for event1 to have occurred earlier.

Step 4 — Conclusion
C1 is true, but event1 does not happen given the context. Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened, and no event1 happened before that (since event2 is initial).
- At the initial moment, C1 (""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"") is false: the antecedent (event2 happens) is true there, but the consequent (event1 happens) is false.
- The context also says that after event2 no other events can happen. So at every subsequent moment, event2 does not happen.
- At those subsequent moments the implication ""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is vacuously true (the antecedent is false).
- Thus there exists a future moment where C1 is true (indeed, every moment after the initial one). Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true.
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C2 asserts that C1 (""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"") will eventually hold (i.e., at some point the implication C1 becomes true).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so there is a trace starting with event2).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen later.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace reasoning:
- Consider the actual (initial) trace: event2 happens and then nothing else. In that trace event2 occurs but event1 did not occur before it (and cannot occur after, since no events can happen after event2). Thus C1 is false in this trace (event2 without event1).
- Because no further events can occur after event2, there is no way for C1 to become true later.

Conclusion:
- C1 does not hold in the given initial/only trace, and it never will hold later. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, it is followed by event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the trace stops once event2 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
- The initial moment has event2 occur.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, no event1 occurs either before or after that event2 in this scenario. (Nothing can happen after event2; no information says event1 happened before.)

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and then C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is false in the given trace, because event2 did happen but event1 did not.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means there is some time in the future (or at some point) where C1 is true. Since C1 is already false at the initial/only relevant time and no further events/times can make it true, C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 true in every state).

Step 2 — interpret conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule A: after event1, event2 must happen (next state after event1 is event2).
- Rule B: after event2, event1 must happen (next state after event2 is event1).

Step 3 — trace from the initial state:
- Initially: event2 occurred.
- By Rule B (after event2 → event1), the next state must have event1.
- Therefore C1 (that event2 happens in the next state) is false (the next state has event1, not event2).

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 asserts C1 always holds, but C1 is already false in the immediate next state.
- Thus C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (call that state s0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever a state has event1, the next state has event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever a state has event2, the next state has event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- s0: event2 (given).
- By the rule ""after event2 → event1"", s1 must be event1.
- By ""after event1 → event2"", s2 must be event2.
- The system therefore alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false at s0 (the next state s1 has event1).
- C1 is true in states where the current state is event1, but false in states where the current state is event2.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") would require C1 to be true in every state; but since the system alternates, C1 is not true in states where the current state is event2.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e., from the current state, the immediate next state has event2.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every reachable state, the next state has event2.)

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen next. (event1 → next event2)
- After event2, event1 must happen next. (event2 → next event1)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Initial state: event2.
- By the rule ""after event2 → next event1"", the next state must have event1 (not event2).
- Then by ""after event1 → next event2"", the following state will have event2, and so on, alternating: event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 in the next state"") is false in the initial state (the next state has event1).
- Therefore C1 does not hold in every state, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this simply asserts that Event1 happens.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — asserts that Event1 happens (at all relevant times / in all traces).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, no other events can happen (so once Event2 has happened, Event1 cannot happen afterward).
- Also ""After Event1, no other events can happen"" but that is irrelevant because Event1 never occurs given Event2 already happened.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- The initial occurrence of Event2 means the system is in a state where no further events can occur. Therefore Event1 does not (and cannot) happen in any continuation from the initial state.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 (Event1 happens) is false in the given context.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1 asserts ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 happens).
- C2 asserts ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. event1 happens in all executions / at all times).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the start event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has happened, no further events (including event1) can ever occur.
- (The clause ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never gets a chance if event2 already happened initially.)

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Since event2 happened initially and that prevents any further events, event1 does not happen.
- Therefore C1 (which requires event1 to happen) is false in the given situation.
- If C1 is not true in the actual (initial) execution, then C1 does not ""always hold.""

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — effectively asserts that Event1 happens (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — asserts that C1 is true in all (reachable) situations.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event1, no other events can happen (Event1 is terminal).
- After Event2, no other events can happen (Event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Because Event2 happened initially and Event2 is terminal, no further events can occur at any time.
- Therefore Event1 does not happen (it cannot occur after the initial Event2).

Step 4 — evaluate the hypotheses
- C1 (Event1 happens) is false in the given scenario.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") therefore is also false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false. C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So the initial state includes event2 having occurred.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That obliges that sometime after event2, event1 occurs.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That only says event1 is terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Since event2 already happened and event2 requires event1 to happen afterward, event1 will (must) occur at some point after the initial event2.
- Once event1 occurs, no further events occur, but that does not contradict the required occurrence of event1.

Conclusion
- C1 is true (event1 does eventually happen). Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Context facts: event2 happened initially. The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means whenever event2 occurs, event1 will eventually occur. Since event2 did occur initially, event1 must eventually occur.
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only says event1 is terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 has occurred, event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (this only says event1 is terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 asks whether ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is ""Event1 always happens."" So C2 says: eventually there will be a point after which event1 holds at every future step.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After any event2, event1 must happen.
- After any event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
Starting from the initial event2, the rules force an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... Event1 occurs infinitely many times but is not true at every moment (event2 occurs between its occurrences).

Step 4 — can C1 ever become permanently true?
C1 (""event1 always happens"") would require that from some point onward only event1 occurs and event2 never occurs again. That contradicts ""after event1, event2 must happen."" So there is no suffix of the execution where event1 holds at every step.

Conclusion
C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step by step:
- The rules force an alternating sequence starting from the initial event2: e2 (initial) → e1 → e2 → e1 → ...
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would mean from some point onward every moment/state satisfies event1 (i.e., event1 holds continuously). That is not the case: after every occurrence of event1 an event2 must occur.
- Therefore C1 is false in every reachable future, so there is no time after which C1 holds permanently.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") asserts that at some future point C1 becomes true; since C1 never becomes true, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at every step/time point, Event1 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., there is some future time from which onward C1 is true — from that point Event1 happens at every step)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- The rules force the infinite alternating sequence: Event2, Event1, Event2, Event1, ...
- Event1 occurs infinitely often, but at no time does Event1 occur at every step from then on (because after any Event1 there is always a subsequent Event2).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false at the start and never becomes true thereafter.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" So C2 is true only if event1 never happens and event2 happens.

- Initially, event1 happened. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- The rest of the rules (after event1 event2 must happen, after event2 event1 must happen) imply event2 will occur after the initial event1, but that doesn't make C1 true.

Step 3 — combine facts:
- C2 requires C1 to be true, but C1 is already false because event1 did happen initially. Thus C2 cannot be true, regardless of whether event2 happens.

Final answer:
False

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" (i.e., C1 ∧ event2).

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen (at least once).

Step 3 — examine C1:
- C1 asserts event1 does not happen, which contradicts the given fact that event1 happened. Therefore C1 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- Determine whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 is true.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Given event2 happened, event1 will occur.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This only restricts later events; it does not prevent event1 itself.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- event2 occurs initially.
- Because event2 occurred, event1 must occur afterward.
- Therefore both event2 and event1 occur; no further events happen after event1.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 is “event1 happens and event2 happens” — true (both occur).
- C2 is “event1 happens or C1 holds.” Since event1 does happen, C2 is true (in fact C2 is equivalent to simply “event1 happens”).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — understand hypothesis:
- C1 = (Event1 happens) AND (Event2 happens).
- C2 = (Event1 happens) OR C1. Logically C2 is equivalent to (Event1 happens) (since P OR (P AND Q) ≡ P).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened. So Event2 is true.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen. So Event1 will happen at some later point.
- After Event1, no other events can happen. That only restricts events after Event1; it doesn't prevent Event1 from occurring after Event2.

Step 3 — trace sequence:
- Event2 occurs initially.
- By the rule, Event1 must occur afterwards.
- Thus both Event2 and Event1 happen (so C1 is true), and in particular Event1 happens.

Conclusion:
- Since Event1 happens, C2 is true.

Final answer: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds (i.e., event2 eventually happens), then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — Examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So C1 is satisfied.
- The context states: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That guarantees that whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" does not contradict the implication; it only constrains events after event1.

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Because event2 does occur (C1 holds) and the context mandates that event1 must happen after event2, the implication in C2 is fulfilled.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning:
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is satisfied.
- The context also states ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That means whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.
- Therefore, given C1 holds (event2 occurs), event1 does happen. Hence C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e., whenever event2 happens, event1 follows)

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So C1 is true.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs afterward.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal, but that doesn't prevent event1 from occurring.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event2 did happen (C1 true), the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen.

Conclusion
- The implication ""if C1 then event1"" is satisfied. Therefore C2 is True."

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event1 does happen"").
The question: is C2 true?

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but that only matters if event1 occurred.)

Step 3 — trace events:
- Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, no other events (including event1) can occur at any time.
- Therefore event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C2 asserts that Event1 does happen).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, the sequence ends).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen at any later time.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypotheses:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e., Event1 does happen) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — understand hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C2 asserts that event1 does happen).

Step 2 — use the context:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Therefore, once event2 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event1) can occur.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Given event2 happened initially and no events can occur afterward, event1 cannot happen. So C1 is true.
- C2 asserts that C1 is false, which contradicts the conclusion that C1 is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""Event1 always holds"" (Event1 is true at all times).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial moment, event1 did not hold).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur next).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate indefinitely: event2, event1, event2, ...).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0: event2 (event1 does not hold).
- At time 1: event1 (event1 holds).
- At time 2: event2 (event1 does not hold).
- And so on, alternating.

Step 4 — determine C2
- C1 (""Event1 happens"") is true at some times (e.g., time 1, 3, ...), but not at all times (it is false at times when event2 occurs, including the initial time).
- Therefore ""Event1 always holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which simplifies to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""Event1 always holds"" (at every point in time).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so events alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...).

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- Although event1 does occur (repeatedly) in the required alternation, it does not hold at every moment — at the times when event2 occurs, event1 is not occurring.
- Therefore ""Event1 always holds"" is not satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context says: initially event1 happened.
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen; and after event2, event1 must happen. So event1 occurs at the start and then (by the rules) event2 and event1 alternate thereafter — in particular event1 does occur.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context (event1 happens initially and recurs), C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is the implication (event1 → C1). Since event1 does happen (antecedent true) and C1 is false (consequent false), the implication is false.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (¬E1)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (E1 → ¬E1)

Step 2 — examine C2:
- E1 → ¬E1 is true exactly when E1 is false. If E1 is true, the implication would require ¬E1, which is false, so the implication would be false. Thus C2 is true iff event1 does not happen (i.e., iff C1 is true).

Step 3 — use the context:
- The context states that initially event1 happened (so E1 is true at least initially), and the rules force E1 and E2 to occur repeatedly thereafter. So event1 does happen.

Step 4 — conclude:
- Since event1 does happen, C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false, and therefore C2 (which is true iff C1 is true) is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true at the start.)
- Rule A: after event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs then event1 occurs later.)
- Rule B: after event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs then event2 occurs later.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the initial fact that event1 happened, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication: event1 → C1. Because event1 does happen (initially) and C1 is false, the implication is false (a true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false).
- Note: the only way such an implication could be true vacuously is if event1 never happened, but here it does.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts two things: (a) C1 holds (i.e. event2 eventually happens) and (b) event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred; C1 is satisfied.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 did happen, this requirement forces event1 to occur sometime after.
- After event1, no other events can happen — this only blocks events after event1, it does not prevent event1 itself.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence
- At the initial moment event2 occurs.
- Because of the ""after event2, event1 must happen"" rule, event1 will occur next.
- After event1, nothing else happens. This sequence satisfies all constraints.

Conclusion
- Both parts of C2 hold (event2 does happen, and event1 happens), so C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asserts: (event2 eventually happens) AND (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 has already happened — so “event2 eventually happens” is true.
- The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” forces event1 to occur (following that initial event2).
- “After event1, no other events can happen” only says nothing comes after event1; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Both conjuncts of C2 are satisfied, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C2 asserts two things: (a) C1 holds (event2 eventually happens), and (b) event1 happens. We must decide whether both are true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred — hence event2 does (in fact) happen.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That means once event2 has occurred, event1 is required to occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That only says event1 is terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Because event2 happened initially, the obligation ""after event2, event1 must happen"" applies, so event1 will (must) occur at some later point. There is no rule blocking event1 from occurring. C1 (event2 eventually happens) is true (it already happened), and event1 happens as required.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both events have occurred).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state, both events have happened.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state s0, event2 has occurred).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so some next state after s0 will have event1 occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequence
- s0: event2 has happened.
- Because event1 must happen after event2, the next state s1 must be one where event1 occurs.
- After s1 (event1), no further events occur.

Step 4 — check C1 in the next state
- In s1, event1 has occurred (at s1) and event2 has already occurred (at s0), so both events have happened by s1. Therefore C1 is true in s1.

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state, both event2 and event1 occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred in the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state must have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events occur afterwards).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Initial state: event2 has happened; event1 has not yet happened.
- Next state (immediately after initial): event1 must happen. Event2 does not reoccur in that next state (there is no rule saying event2 occurs again), and after event1 no further events can happen.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- In the next state only event1 happens; event2 does not also happen there. Therefore C1 (both event2 and event1 happen) does not hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 asserts: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 = ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" So we must decide whether, in the next state, both event2 and event1 happen.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially (current state) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → the next state will have event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal (no further events after it).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Current state: event2 occurs.
- Next state: event1 occurs (required by the second condition).
- There is no indication that event2 also occurs in that next state; event2 occurred in the initial state only.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
C2 requires that in the next state both event2 and event1 happen. The next state has event1 but not event2, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens).
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so immediately/next, or eventually, an event2 occurs following any event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 follows any event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event1 occurs.
- Because after event1 event2 must happen, event2 occurs at some point after that.
- Because after event2 event1 must happen, event1 occurs again, then event2 again, etc.
- This forces an alternating pattern: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... So event1 does occur infinitely often but not at every moment—there are times/steps where event2 is occurring instead of event1.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Interpreting ""always happens"" in the usual sense (""at all times"" or ""in every state/step""), C1 is false, because there are steps when event2 happens instead of event1.
- Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (C1 holds AND event1 happens) is false regardless of whether event1 does happen at some times.

Final answer:
False
---
Identification
- C1 asserts: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2 asserts: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" (i.e., C1 ∧ event1).

Examine conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule: after any event1, event2 must occur later.
- Rule: after any event2, event1 must occur later.
These force an alternation: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, ...

Trace and conclusion
- Event1 does occur (initially and repeatedly), but it does not hold at every moment in time (there are moments when event2 occurs instead).
- Therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false.
- Since C2 is a conjunction requiring C1, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You ask whether C2 is True or False. C2 is the conjunction: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens). C1 says “Event1 always happens.”

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" (the second conjunct of C2) is true at least initially.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 occurs, a later event2 is required).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur again after event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequences
Starting from the initial event1, the rules force event2 to happen later, which in turn forces event1 again, and so on. This yields an alternating sequence of events (event1, event2, event1, ...). That means event1 occurs repeatedly, but it is not true that event1 holds at every moment in time (there are times when event2 occurs instead).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1, “Event1 always happens,” requires event1 to hold at all times; the rules do not guarantee that (event2 occurs in-between), so C1 is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold (and even though event1 does happen), the conjunction C2 is false because C1 is false.

Sample responses:

Reasoning:
- C1 says: whenever event1 happens, event2 happens.
- The context says event1 happens initially, and after that no events can occur. So event2 never happens at any time.
- Since event1 did happen (initially) but event2 does not, C1 is already false (the implication is violated).
- That fact cannot be fixed later (event2 will not occur), so C1 will never become true at any future time.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e. event1 ⇒ event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C1 can ever become true given the system constraints.

Step 2 — given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no future events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. That rule prevents event2 from occurring before event1 (because if event2 occurred earlier, event1 would have to occur after it, contradicting that event1 already happened initially).

Step 3 — trace reasoning
- Event2 cannot occur after event1 (by ""after event1, no other events can happen"").
- Event2 cannot have occurred before event1 either, because that would force event1 to occur after event2 (contradiction with the initial event1).
- Therefore event2 can never occur in any execution.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 requires that because event1 happened, event2 must happen; but event2 never occurs. So C1 is false (it does not hold).
- Because C1 is never true in any future state, ""C1 eventually holds"" is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step‑by‑step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. it is always true that Event1 always happens).

2. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event1 occurred.
   - Rule A: after an occurrence of event1, event2 must occur sometime later.
   - Rule B: after an occurrence of event2, event1 must occur sometime later.

3. Examine the conditions and trace possible sequence:
   - From the initial event1 and Rule A, event2 must occur at some future point.
   - When that event2 occurs (by Rule B) event1 must occur later again, and so on — this forces alternating occurrences: e1, e2, e1, e2, …
   - Crucially, there are time points (for example, any time when event2 occurs) at which event1 is not occurring right now.

4. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - If ""Event1 always happens"" is read as ""event1 holds at every time point"" (the usual reading of “always”), C1 is false because there are times (when event2 occurs) at which event1 is not happening.
   - Since C1 is not true, the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., is the statement C1 true in the given scenario?)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later point).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after that).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
- Start: event1 occurs.
- Then (by the rule) event2 occurs.
- Then (by the other rule) event1 occurs again.
- This forces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- Event1 occurs infinitely often, but not at every moment/state (times when event2 occurs, event1 is not occurring).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 asserts that event1 always happens at all times. That is false because there are times where event2 occurs instead (so event1 does not hold at those times).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. it is always true that Event1 always happens)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happens (so event1 occurs at the start).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so some later point there is event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur again later).
Thus the system forces an alternation: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, ….

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- If ""always happens"" is read as ""occurs at every moment/state,"" C1 is false: there are times when event2 occurs and event1 does not, so event1 does not hold at every moment.
- (If instead ""always happens"" were read as ""occurs infinitely often,"" then C1 would be true because of the enforced alternation. But that is a different meaning.)

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Under the natural reading of C1 as ""holds at all times,"" C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Even under the alternative reading where C1 means ""occurs infinitely often,"" C2 would be asking that that property itself holds at every moment; while that alternate interpretation could make C2 true, the usual plain-language reading makes C2 false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's asked:
- Determine whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 will occur (following event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen. That only makes event1 terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 happened, C1 is true.
- C2: requires event1 happens (true, because event1 must follow event2) and C1 holds (true). Both parts are true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens or event1 happens.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will (must) occur after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen — this only stops further events, it doesn't prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace events:
- Event2 happens initially.
- Then event1 happens (required by the second condition).
- Therefore both event2 and event1 occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true (event2 or event1 holds; in fact both hold).
- C2 requires event1 and C1; both are true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. => event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must happen. => event1 occurs (after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen. => no events occur after event1 (no contradiction with event1 occurring).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 happened, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen (required after event2), and C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis:
- C2: ""C1 always holds.""
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Examine conditions and trace the sequence:
1. Initially, event1 happened → at the initial state C1 is true (event1 has occurred).
2. After event1, event2 must happen → next state: event2 happens.
3. After event2, no other events can happen → from that state onward, event1 will never occur again.

Does C1 hold at every state?
- At the state after event2, event1 will not happen in the future, so C1 is false there.

Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.

False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., at the current point in time, there will be some future time where event1 occurs).
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every point in time, C1 is true; formally G(F event1)).

Step 2 — given scenario
- Initially event1 happened (so C1 is true at the initial point).
- After that, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs, there is no future occurrence of event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- At the initial point C1 is true (event1 already happened).
- At the point after event2, there are no future events, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is false there.
- Therefore C1 is not true at every point in time, so C2 (that C1 always holds) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (an eventuality about the future from a given time)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" i.e., at every point in time, C1 is true (always eventually Event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event1 has already happened (so C1 is true at the initial time).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so the trace is Event1 then Event2).
- After Event2, no other events can happen (execution terminates).

Step 3 — trace the execution
- Trace: time0: Event1; time1: Event2; afterward: no events.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- At the initial time, C1 holds because Event1 has happened.
- But at a time after Event2, there are no future events, so ""Event1 eventually happens"" (from that time forward) is false.
- Therefore C1 does not hold at all times; C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e., every occurrence of event2 is preceded by/had event1.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (we must decide if C1 is true in the system described).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred in the initial state of any run.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur, and it occurs only after event1.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is final).

Step 3 — trace event sequences
- Because event1 is true initially and event2 is required to happen only after event1, any occurrence of event2 in any execution is necessarily preceded by the initial event1.
- There is no allowed execution in which event2 occurs without event1 having happened earlier.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore the implication in C1 (event2 ⇒ event1) holds in all executions, so C1 always holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is indeed always true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So every execution starts with event1 already having happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur (and it will occur after that initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This only says event2 is terminal; it doesn't allow event2 to precede event1.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 holds initially and event2 is required after event1, any trace that contains event2 has event1 earlier in that trace. There is no allowed trace where event2 happens without event1 having happened first.

Step 4 — conclude
- Therefore the implication in C1 is true in all possible traces allowed by the context, so C1 always holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens (event2 → event1).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., the implication event2 → event1 is true in all allowed executions).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So in every execution there is an occurrence of event1 at the start.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So because event1 happened initially, a following event2 will occur in every execution.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event2, when it occurs, comes after the initial event1 and is terminal.

Step 3 — reason about event ordering:
- Any occurrence of event2 in any execution is preceded by the initial event1 (since event1 happened initially and that forces a later event2).
- Therefore whenever event2 occurs, event1 has already occurred in that execution.

Conclusion:
- The implication event2 → event1 holds in every allowed execution, so C1 always holds.

Final answer: True"
