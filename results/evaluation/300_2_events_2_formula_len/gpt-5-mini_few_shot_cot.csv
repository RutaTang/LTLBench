Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens"" — this is true in a state if event2 holds now or at some future point.
2. The context says initially event2 happened, so C1 is true at the initial state.
3. The context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" so once in a state with event2 the system remains in event2 states thereafter.
4. Therefore, at every reachable state (initial and all future states) event2 holds, so C1 holds in every state.

3. C1 is ""event1 does not happen"" — this is true in any state where event1 is false.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state is event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate).

- Start: event2.

2. C2 = ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is an implication: whenever event2 is true, event1 must be false in that same state.
3. By the context, exactly one event holds in a state (events are exclusive). Thus in any state where event2 holds, event1 cannot hold in that same state, so C1 would hold there.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1 = ""event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
   - C2 = ""if C1 holds, then event1 happens"" (X event1 -> event1, where the right-hand event1 is at the current state).

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1 holds.
   - After event1, no other events can happen — so once in an event1 state you remain in event1 in the next state (event1 is persistent).
   - There is no rule that leads to any other event from event1, and event2 is not reachable from the initial state.

3. Therefore, in every reachable state event1 holds, and X event1 also holds. So whenever C1 holds, event1 already holds at the current state; the implication X event1 -> event1 is always true.

4. Hence C2 is True."

3. Therefore C1 holds in every state under the given context.
4. C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"".
5. Since C1 always holds, the disjunction (Event1 or C1) is always true regardless of whether Event1 happens.
6. Hence C2 is True.

1. C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens."" By standard interpretation, ""eventually"" includes the current state (an event that already holds counts as eventually happening).

2. The context says: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So C1 holds at the initial state (event1 already holds).

3. The context also says: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once in a state where event1 holds, the system stays in event1 forever (no transitions to other events).

4. Therefore, at every state along the (unique) execution starting from the initial state, event1 holds. So at every state C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true (indeed event1 holds immediately).

2. Initially event2 happened (initial state S0 has event2).
3. The context says ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — interpreted as once in a state with event2, all subsequent states remain event2.
4. Therefore from S0 onward event2 holds at every state, so C1 holds at S0.
5. The next state S1 (immediately after S0) also has event2, and by the same rule all states from S1 onward are event2 — so C1 holds in S1.
6. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1 holds at S1). From (5), this is true.

1. C1 is ""event2 does not happen"" (¬event2).
2. The context says ""Initially, event2 happened,"" so in the initial state event2 is true, therefore C1 is false in the initial state.
3. C2 requires C1 to hold in every state (""always ¬event2""), so it must hold in the initial state as well.

1. C1 means ""Event1 always happens"" — i.e., in the current state and in every future state, event1 holds.
2. The context forces alternation: initially event2; after event2 → event1; after event1 → event2. So the sequence of states is event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
3. In that sequence, there are states where event2 holds (e.g., the initial state and every even-indexed state), so no state has event1 true in every future state.
4. Therefore C1 is false at every state (there is always a future state with event2).

1. C1 is ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" — i.e., both hold at the same state.
2. Context: Initially Event1 happened, so the initial state has Event1 = true (and Event2 = false).
3. The context also says: ""After Event1, no other events can happen."" That means from any state where Event1 holds, the system cannot transition to a state where a different event holds; it stays at Event1.
4. Therefore Event2 never occurs in any future state (once Event1 holds initially, no transition to Event2 is possible).

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event1 is true (state0).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so state1: event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (all subsequent states remain event2).

2. Interpretations:
   - C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — i.e., in every state on the run, event1 holds.
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state, the property C1 is true.

3. Check C1 from the initial state:
   - At state0 event1 is true, but in the next state event2 holds and event1 is false.
   - Therefore event1 does not hold in all states of the run, so C1 is false at the initial state (in fact false at every state).

1. Hypothesis components:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, the next state satisfies Event1).

2. Context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (the system stays at event1).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (the system stays at event2).

3. From the initial state (event2), because after event2 no other events can happen, the next state must also be event2 (not event1). Therefore C1 is false in the initial state.

1. Initially event2 is true.
2. After event2, event1 must happen, so the next state has event1 true.
3. After event1, no other events can happen, so the system stays at event1 thereafter.
4. C1 is (event1 AND event1), which simplifies to event1 — true in states where event1 holds.
5. C2 is (C1 AND event2), i.e. (event1 AND event2) — requires event1 and event2 to be true simultaneously in the same state.
6. In this model a state has a single event true; event1 and event2 cannot be true at the same time.
7. Therefore C2 cannot be satisfied in any state.

- C2: C1 holds AND event1 happens.

Step 3 — reasoning about possible states:
- The initial state has event1 true.

Reasoning (step by step):
1. C1 says: Event1 happens in the next state.
2. The context: ""Initially, event1 happened"" — the initial state has event1 true.
3. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means the successor state(s) reachable from an event1 state cannot switch to a different event; as in the examples, the system remains at event1.
4. Therefore the next state after the initial state also has event1 true, so C1 holds.
5. C2 is ""C1 does not hold""; since C1 does hold, C2 is false."

1. We check C2 at the initial state. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state.""
2. C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C2 says: in the next state, Event1 happens in that next state's next state — equivalently, Event1 holds two steps from the initial state.

4. After event2, no other events can happen — so state2 and all later states remain event2.

4. C1 (= event2 AND event1) requires both events to hold in the same state, which is impossible, so C1 is false in every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""event1 does not happen"" (i.e., not event1). C2 is ""(not event1) and event2"".
2. Initially event1 happens, so C2 is false in the initial state.
3. The context requires that after event1, event2 must happen. So the next state has event2 true and event1 false.
4. In that state, (not event1) is true and event2 is true, so C2 holds.
5. Therefore C2 does occur (indeed it holds immediately after the initial state), so C2 is True."

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not eventually happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays in a state where event2 holds).
- (Also: after event1, event2 must happen — not needed here but consistent.)

Step 3 — Reason about event sequences:
- Because event2 is true in the initial state, C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is already satisfied at the initial state.
- Moreover, since no other events can happen after event2, event2 persists, so C1 remains true.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- C1 holds, therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
