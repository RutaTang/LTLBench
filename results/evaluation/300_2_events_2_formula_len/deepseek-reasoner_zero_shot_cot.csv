- C1 is defined as ""event1 happens and event1 happens."" Logically, this is equivalent to ""event1 happens,"" which is true because event1 occurred initially.
- C2 is defined as ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 holds (as event1 happened), and event1 does happen (as per the context), the conditional statement C2 is true.

Even if we consider the possibility that C1 might be false (e.g., if ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" were interpreted as requiring two occurrences, which is impossible due to the context), C2 would still be true because a conditional with a false antecedent is vacuously true.

- At state S1, event2 occurs. From S1, event1 does not occur in any future state (since after event2, no events happen). Thus, C1 is false at S1.
