</graphml>",0,"Based on the context, events occur sequentially, and only one event can happen in any given state. C1 requires both event9 and event6 to happen simultaneously, which is impossible because only one event can occur at a time. Therefore, C1 is always false.

C2 states that if event7 happens, then C1 holds. Since C1 is always false, C2 can only be true if event7 never happens. However, from the initial event3, event7 can be reached through various sequences (e.g., event3 → event5 → event7 or event3 → event1 → event7). Thus, event7 can happen, and whenever it does, C1 must hold, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C2 states that if event3 happens, then C1 must hold, where C1 is ""Event2 happens and event8 happens."" This means that whenever event3 occurs, both event2 and event8 must have occurred at some point before or during the state where event3 is true.

The initial state is event1. From event1, the transitions allow going directly to event3 (as per ""After event1, either event2, event3, event7, or event9 must happen""). In the sequence event1 → event3, when event3 occurs, event2 has not occurred, and event8 has not occurred. Therefore, C1 does not hold when event3 happens, violating C2.

Since there exists a valid sequence where event3 occurs without C1 holding, C2 is not always true. Thus, C2 is False.

This means that in any state where event5 occurs, event9 must also occur in the same state for C1 to be true. However, since only one event can occur per state, it is impossible for both event5 and event9 to happen simultaneously. Therefore, C1 is true only in states where event5 does not happen.

The initial state has event1 happening, so event5 is not happening in the initial state. Thus, C1 is true in the initial state. Since C1 holds initially, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is immediately true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context, events occur sequentially, meaning only one event can be true at any given time. C1 requires both event3 and event7 to happen simultaneously, which is impossible due to the sequential nature of events. Therefore, C1 is always false. The implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is vacuously true when C1 is false. Thus, C2 is true.

Additionally, event7 never occurs in any sequence starting from the initial event2, as there are no transitions that lead to event7. This further ensures that C1 is always false.

The initial state has event8 happening, so event5 does not happen initially. Therefore, C1 holds at the initial state. Since C1 holds immediately, C2 is true. Additionally, even if event5 occurs later, the transitions from event5 always lead to event4, event7, or event9, meaning that after event5, event5 does not happen in the next state.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and the hypothesis, C2 states that C1 does not hold, where C1 is defined as ""Event6 happens and Event2 happens."" This means that for C2 to be true, it must be that in all possible sequences, either Event6 never occurs or Event2 never occurs.

However, from the initial state of Event3, there exists a sequence where both Event6 and Event2 occur. For example:
- Start from Event3.
- Transition to Event5 (allowed after Event3).
- Transition to Event2 (allowed after Event5).
- Transition to Event1 (allowed after Event2).
- Transition to Event6 (required after Event1).

In this sequence, Event2 occurs after Event5, and Event6 occurs after Event1, so both events happen. Therefore, C1 holds in this sequence, meaning C2 does not hold.

Since C2 is false in at least one sequence, C2 is false.

Event4 is not a possible next event from event8. Therefore, C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") does not hold in the initial state. Since C2 is defined as ""C1 does not hold"", C2 is true in the initial state.

Thus, C2 is True.

In the system, only one event occurs at a time in any given state. Therefore, when event3 happens, event2 cannot be happening in the same state, so C1 is always true when event3 occurs. This makes the implication in C2 always true. Additionally, even if event3 never occurs, the implication would be vacuously true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the analysis of the hypothesis and the context where only one event happens at a time, C1 is defined as ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens."" Since events are sequential and mutually exclusive in any state, event4 and event5 cannot occur simultaneously. Therefore, in states where event4 happens, C1 is false because event5 does not occur in the same state. However, in states where event4 does not happen, C1 is vacuously true.

C2 is defined as ""If event8 happens, then C1 holds."" When event8 happens, event4 does not occur in that state (because only one event occurs per state), so C1 is true in that state. Thus, whenever event8 occurs, C1 holds, making C2 true. Additionally, if event8 never occurs, the implication is vacuously true. Therefore, C2 is always true regardless of the event sequence.

Logically, if event6 happens, then C1 is always true because C1 requires that event6 happens whenever event7 happens. Since event6 has already occurred, C1 is satisfied regardless of whether event7 happens or not. Therefore, whenever event6 occurs, C1 holds, making C2 true in all possible sequences.

Thus, C2 is True.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context, events occur sequentially, meaning only one event can happen in any single state. C1 is defined as ""Event4 happens and event1 happens,"" which requires both events to occur simultaneously in the same state. However, since events are mutually exclusive, it is impossible for both event4 and event1 to happen at the same time. Therefore, C1 never holds. 

The hypothesis C2 states ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is always false, the implication is vacuously true. Thus, C2 is true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context, initially event1 happened. C1 is defined as ""If event7 happens, then event5 happens."" In logical terms, this implication holds true in a state if event7 does not happen in that state, because if event7 happens, event5 cannot happen simultaneously (since only one event occurs per state), making the implication false.

Since event1 happened initially, event7 is not happening in the initial state. Therefore, C1 holds true in the initial state. C2 states that ""C1 eventually holds,"" and since C1 holds immediately in the initial state, C2 is true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C2 is defined as ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds,"" where C1 is ""Event7 does not happen."" Interpreting C1 as a state predicate meaning that event7 is not happening in the current state, and given that only one event occurs at a time, when event3 happens, event7 is not happening. Therefore, C1 holds whenever event3 happens.

Since event3 occurs only at the initial state (as there are no transitions back to event3 from any other event), and at that initial state, event7 is not happening, C1 holds. Thus, C2 is true.

From the initial state event3, one possible sequence is event3 → event6 → event2 → event8. In this sequence, event6 occurs after event3, and event8 occurs after event2, so both event6 and event8 have occurred. Therefore, C1 holds in this sequence.

Since C1 holds in at least one sequence, C2 (which claims C1 never holds) is false.

This means that whenever event7 occurs, both event1 and event3 must be true simultaneously. However, in the given context, only one event can occur at a time, so it is impossible for both event1 and event3 to be true in the same state. Therefore, C1 is always false.

From the initial state (event8), it is possible to reach event7 through the sequence event8 → event1 → event7. In this sequence, event7 occurs, but C1 does not hold. Thus, the implication ""if event7 happens, then C1 holds"" is false in this sequence. Since there exists at least one sequence where event7 occurs and C1 does not hold, C2 is false.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context, events happen one at a time, meaning only one event is true in any given state. C1 states that ""event4 does not happen,"" which means event4 is false in the current state. C2 states that ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds,"" meaning that whenever event1 is true, event4 must be false.

Since only one event can be true at a time, when event1 happens, event4 cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, whenever event1 occurs, C1 automatically holds because event4 is not happening. Thus, C2 is always true in all possible sequences of events.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context, the initial event is event1. The transitions allow for multiple paths where event9 is never chosen. For example, from event1, one can go to event2, then to event4, and back to event1, forming a cycle that avoids event9. Similarly, other cycles like event1 → event3 → event1 also avoid event9. Since event9 is always an optional transition and not mandatory, there exists at least one sequence where event9 does not happen. Therefore, C1 (""Event9 always happens"") is false, meaning C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Therefore, C2, which states ""C1 does not hold,"" is true.

This means that when event9 happens, it is not necessary that event8 happens in the next state; it could be event5 or event6 instead. Therefore, the condition C2 (""If event9 happens, then C1 holds"") is not always true, as C1 requires event8 to happen in the next state. Hence, C2 is False.

</graphml>",1,"The hypothesis C2 states that C1 eventually holds. C1 is defined as ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In this context, ""happens"" refers to the event occurring in the current state. Since only one event can occur per state, C1 holds in a state if event1 is not occurring in that state, because if event1 occurs, event2 cannot occur simultaneously, making C1 false.

Initially, event6 occurred, so event1 is not occurring. Thus, C1 holds initially. Therefore, C2 (C1 eventually holds) is true immediately.

Even if event1 occurs later, after event1, the transitions lead to other events (event3, event4, event5, event6, or event7), so event1 does not occur in the next state. Thus, there will always be states where event1 does not occur, ensuring C1 holds infinitely often.

Hence, C2 is true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C1 states that ""Event2 always happens,"" meaning event2 is true in every state. However, in this system, only one event occurs per state, and the transitions ensure that event2 cannot be true in every state. Initially, event1 occurs, and from event1, the possible next events are event4, event6, event7, or event8, none of which are event2. Even when event2 occurs, it must transition to other events such as event3, event5, event6, event7, or event8, so event2 does not persist in subsequent states. Therefore, C1 is always false.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C1 is defined as ""Event8 happens and event8 happens,"" which simplifies to ""Event8 happens."" C2 states that ""C1 always holds,"" meaning that event8 must happen in every state.

However, the initial state has event3 happened, which is not event8. Therefore, at the initial state, C1 is false. Additionally, from the transitions, event8 is not always possible or required in every state. For example, after event3, the possible next events are event1, event2, event6, event7, or event9, none of which are event8. After event8, the next event must be event4 or event5, so event8 cannot occur consecutively in all states. Thus, there is no path where event8 happens in every state, meaning C1 does not always hold.

Therefore, C2 is false.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C1 is defined as ""Event1 always happens,"" meaning that from some point onward, Event1 occurs in every state. However, from the transition rules, after Event1 occurs, it must always be followed by one of Event4, Event5, Event7, Event8, or Event9. This means that Event1 cannot occur consecutively in two states; after Event1, another event must occur. Therefore, it is impossible for Event1 to be true in every state from any point onward. Thus, C1 never holds, and consequently, C2 (C1 eventually holds) is false.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C1 is defined as ""Event1 always happens,"" meaning that Event1 must occur in every state. However, from the initial state where event6 happened, and according to the transition rules, after event1, either event5 or event9 must happen. This means that if event1 occurs in a state, the next state must have event5 or event9, so event1 cannot occur in consecutive states. Therefore, it is impossible for event1 to always happen in every state. Thus, C1 is false.

C2 requires both C1 to hold and event8 to happen. Since C1 is false, C2 is false regardless of whether event8 happens or not.

Therefore, C2 is False.

From the initial event6, there are multiple paths where event4 can occur:
- From event6, going to event3, then to event4.
- From event6, going to event1, then to event7, then to event4.
- From event6, going to event8, then to event7, then to event4.

- After event1, either event7 or event9 must happen, neither of which is event2.
- After event7, the next event can be event3, event4, event5, event6, event8, or event9, but not event2.

From the given transitions:
- After event7, either event1 or event5 must happen. This means that from event7, the next event can only be event1 or event5, not event8.

Since there is no transition from event7 to event8, it is impossible for event7 to be immediately followed by event8. Therefore, C2 can never be true.

However, from the context, after event4, the next event must be either event2 or event8, not event4. Since the initial state is event4, the next state cannot be event4, so C1 is false at the initial state. Therefore, C2 cannot be true.

</graphml>",0,"C2 is defined as ""C1 holds in the next state,"" where C1 is ""If event5 happens, then event2 happens."" Since only one event can occur in any state, if event5 happens, event2 cannot happen simultaneously, making C1 false whenever event5 occurs. Therefore, for C2 to be true, event5 must never occur in any next state.

From the initial event9, the transitions allow going to event5 directly (as per ""After event9, either event2, event4, event5, event7, or event8 must happen""). Thus, from the state event9, the next state can be event5, where C1 is false. This means C2 does not hold for the state event9, so C2 is false.

The initial event is Event1. From Event1, the possible next events are Event4, Event5, Event6, Event8, or Event9. If we choose to go to Event4 from Event1, then from Event4, the possible next events include Event7. Therefore, at the state where Event4 occurs, if we transition to Event7, C1 holds at that state (i.e., Event7 happens in the next state).

Since there exists a sequence where C1 holds (e.g., Event1 → Event4 → Event7), C2 is true.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and the hypothesis, C2 requires that C1 (event6 happens or event2 happens) holds in the next state from any current state. However, from the transition rules, there are several events where the next possible events include events that are not event2 or event6. For example:

- After event3, the next events can be event1, event5, or event7, none of which are event2 or event6.
- After event1, the next events can be event3, event4, event7, or event8, which are not event2 or event6.
- Similarly, after event4, event5, event7, event8, event9, etc., there are next events that are not event2 or event6.

Since there exists at least one state (e.g., event3) where a possible next state does not satisfy C1, C2 cannot be true for all states. Therefore, C2 is False.

From the transitions, Event8 can only be reached directly from Event3, as after Event3, the possible next events include Event8. Initially, Event1 happened. From Event1, it is possible to go directly to Event3. Once at Event3, we can choose to go to Event8, meaning that at the Event3 state, the next event is Event8, so C1 holds at that state.

Since Event3 is reachable from the initial state and Event8 is a valid transition from Event3, C1 eventually holds. Therefore, C2 is true.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C1 is defined as ""Event6 always happens,"" meaning that in every state, event6 must be true. However, from the initial state where event5 happened, the transitions require that after event5, either event6 or event7 must happen. If event6 happens, then after event6, the next event must be event2, event4, event7, or event8, all of which are not event6. Similarly, if event7 happens, subsequent events include event1, event3, event5, event6, or event8, which also do not ensure event6 always happens. Therefore, event6 does not always happen in every state, making C1 false.

C2 requires both C1 to hold and event5 to happen. Since event5 happened initially, event5 has occurred, but C1 is false. Thus, C2 is false.

</graphml>",0,"C1 is defined as ""Event3 happens and Event3 happens,"" which simplifies to ""Event3 happens."" C2 states that C1 eventually holds, meaning that Event3 must occur at some point in the sequence.

The initial state is Event4. From Event4, transitions can lead to Event1, Event5, Event6, Event7, or Event9. From these events, it is possible to reach Event3 directly or indirectly (e.g., from Event5 to Event3, from Event6 to Event3, from Event9 to Event3, or from Event1 to Event8 to Event3). However, there are sequences where Event3 is never reached. For example, the cycle Event4 → Event7 → Event2 → Event4 can repeat indefinitely without Event3 occurring. Since there exists at least one sequence where Event3 does not happen, C2 is not always true.

Therefore, C2 is False.

If event4 happens directly from event6, then in that state, event4 occurs and event7 does not occur (since only one event happens per state). Therefore, C1 (event7 does not happen) holds, and event4 happens, so C2 is true.

Even if other paths are taken, event4 is reachable from multiple points (e.g., from event5, event2, etc.), so there exists at least one sequence where event4 occurs. Thus, C2 can be true in some state.

The hypothesis C2 requires that ""Event9 happens and C1 holds,"" where C1 is ""Event8 happens or event3 happens."" This implies that both Event9 and either Event8 or Event3 must be true simultaneously.

Since C1 states that ""event5 always happens,"" which requires event5 to be true in every state, including the initial state, C1 is false at the initial state. Therefore, C2, which states that ""C1 always holds,"" is false because C1 does not hold from the start.

Even considering possible sequences from the initial state, event5 does not occur initially, and the transitions from event6 lead to event2 or event8, neither of which is event5. Thus, there is no sequence where event5 is true in every state, confirming that C2 is false.

C2: Event7 happens and C1 holds.

C2 is True or False?
