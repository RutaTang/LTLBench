C2 is True.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- We start at event9. From 9 we may choose 4,7, or 8 (avoiding 2 and 6).
- From 4 we can choose 1 (avoiding 2 and 6).
- From 1 we can choose 3 (avoiding 2 and 6).
- From 3 we can choose 7 (avoiding 2).
- From 7 we can choose 5 (avoiding 2).
- From 5 we can choose 1 (avoiding 2).

This gives a cycle 1 → 3 → 7 → 5 → 1 reachable from 9 (for example 9 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 7 → 5 → 1 → ...), which never visits event2 or event6. Therefore ""Event6 happens or event2 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, so C1 does not hold. Hence C2 (C1 does not hold) is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, the transition rules include: 7 -> {1,2,4,5,8,9}, 4 -> {1,6,9}, 1 -> {2,3,5,6,7}, and 3 -> 1 (deterministically).
- The system starts with event7 occurring.
- Counterexample trace reachable from the start that avoids event8 forever:
  7 (initial) -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... 
  This loop (1↔3) is allowed by the rules and never produces event8.
- Therefore it is possible for event4 to occur and still have a continuation in which event8 never happens. That falsifies the implication ""if event4 happens, then event8 eventually happens.""

So C2 is False.
---
You're asking whether the implication ""if event4 happens then eventually event8 happens"" (C2) is guaranteed by the given transition rules.

Short answer: False.

Reasoning:
- Initial event7 can occur, and from event7 one allowed choice is event4, so it is possible to reach event4.
- From event4 the allowed next events are {event1, event6, event9}. Choose event1.
- From event1 the allowed next events are {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7}. Choose event3.
- From event3 the only allowed next event is event1. So 1 → 3 → 1 is a valid loop.
- By repeatedly taking 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... we can produce an infinite run that visits event4 (earlier) but never visits event8.

Because there exists a valid continuation after event4 that avoids event8 forever, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Counterexample (all transitions are allowed by the rules in the context):
- Initially event7 happens. After event7 one allowed next event is event4.
- From event4 one allowed next event is event1.
- From event1 one allowed next event is event2.
- From event2 one allowed next event is event4.

This yields the loop 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 repeated indefinitely. That run contains event4 but never contains event8, so event8 is not guaranteed to eventually happen after event4. Therefore the implication ""if event4 happens then event8 eventually happens"" is false."

We interpret C1 as ""event5 does not happen (from now on)"" and C2 as ""eventually C1 holds"" — i.e. there is some future point after which event5 never occurs. To show C2 is false it suffices to give a possible infinite trace in which event5 keeps occurring (so C1 never eventually holds).

From the rules:
- After event1, event5 or event6 may occur.
- After event5, event1 may occur.
Thus the 2-step cycle 1 → 5 → 1 is allowed (1 -> 5 by the first rule, 5 -> 1 by the second). Repeating this gives the infinite trace:
initially event1, then event5, then event1, then event5, ...,
so event5 occurs infinitely often.

Because such a run exists, it is not the case that eventually event5 permanently stops in all runs. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event8 always happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens."" (i.e., C1 → event5)

2. Use the given conditions:
- Initially event9 happened.
- After event9, the next event must be one of {1,4,5,7} (8 is not allowed).

3. Examine C1 against the rules:
- If event8 always happens, then every step (including the step immediately after the initial event9) would have to be event8.
- But the rule after the initial event9 forbids event8 as the next event. So there is no possible sequence consistent with the rules in which event8 ""always happens.""
- Therefore C1 is impossible (no model satisfies C1).

4. Conclusion about the implication:
- An implication with a false (unsatisfiable) antecedent is vacuously true.
- Since C1 cannot hold, ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"" is true.

Final answer: True

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: C1 just asserts that event2 happens. From the context, starting from the initial event9, event2 is an allowed next event (after event9 either event2, event3, event4, or event6 may happen). So event2 can occur, meaning C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
True

Reasoning in brief:
- C1 asserts ""event2 happens"" (it's redundant).
- From the context, after the initial event9 one allowed next event is event3.
- After event3, no other events can happen, so the sequence 9 → 3 is valid and contains no event2.
- Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this just asserts that event2 happens.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. event2 does NOT happen.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition
- Initially event9 happened.
- After event9, one of {event2, event3, event4, event6} must happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- From the rule after event9, it is possible to choose event2 next (since event2 is one of the allowed successors of event9). Thus there exists a valid sequence in which event2 happens, so C1 can be true.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C2 claims C1 does not hold (i.e. event2 does not happen). Because there is a valid sequence where event2 does happen, C2 is not true.

Final answer: False"

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- From the context, after event3 (initial) you can go to event5 (3 -> 5).
- From event5 you can go to event7 (5 -> 7), so event7 can occur.
- After event7 the allowed next events include event1 (7 -> 1).
- After event1 the allowed next events include event7 (1 -> 7).

Thus there is an allowed cycle 7 -> 1 -> 7 -> 1 ... that never forces event9 or event6 to occur. In particular, one valid continuation after 7 is to repeatedly alternate 7 and 1, avoiding both event9 and event6 forever. Therefore ""if event7 happens then event9 and event6 happen"" is not guaranteed, so C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context, event3 can go to event1, and event1 can go to event7. So a sequence reaching event7 is possible: 3 → 1 → 7.
- After event7 the allowed next events include event1, and after event1 event7 is allowed again. So the sequence 3 → 1 → 7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → ... is a valid continuation that never includes event9 or event6.
- Therefore it is not guaranteed that whenever event7 happens both event9 and event6 will happen. Hence C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Counterexample: start with event3 (given). Choose event1 (allowed after event3). Then choose event7 (allowed after event1). After event7 choose event1 again (allowed after event7). Repeat the 7→1 loop indefinitely. This path contains event7 but never forces event9 or event6 to occur, so ""if event7 happens then event9 and event6 happen"" is not guaranteed. Thus C2 is false."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- From the rules: 1 -> {2,3,4,5,9} and 4 -> {1,2}. In particular 1 -> 4 and 4 -> 1 are allowed.
- Therefore if event1 happens we can choose the infinite loop 1,4,1,4,... and never take any transition to event9.
- That yields a valid run where event1 occurs but event9 does not (again) — so ""Event9 always happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed by event1.
Thus C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event9 occurs.
- After event9, event1 is allowed, so consider the sequence: event9, event1.
- After event1, event2 is allowed; after event2, event3 is allowed; after event3, event2 is allowed. So we can continue: event2, event3, event2, event3, ... forever.
- This infinite trace contains event1 but does not have event9 at every step (only the initial step was event9), so C1 (""Event9 always happens"") is false in that trace.
- Therefore C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is false because we exhibited a counterexample.
---
False

Counterexample: start with event9, then choose the sequence 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... . After event9 you may go to event1 (allowed). After event1 you may go to event4 (allowed). After event4 you may return to event1 (allowed), and repeat forever. This infinite run contains event1 but never again contains event9, so ""Event9 always happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed when event1 happens. Hence C2 is false."

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happened.
- The rules state that after event6, event8 must happen (no alternative).

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happened.
- The rules state ""After event6, event8 must happen."" That fixes the next event as event8.
- Since the next event is event8 (not event5), the proposition ""Event5 does not happen"" (C1) is true in that next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.

- Initially event6 happened, so C1 (event5 does not happen in the initial state) is true.
- After event6, event8 must happen. Therefore the next state is event8.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event8 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event4 happens or C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — initial condition and consequences
- The scenario begins with ""Initially, event4 happened."" So event4 has occurred in the actual run (at the start).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Since event4 already happens, the disjunction ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"" is satisfied immediately, regardless of whether C1 is true.

(For completeness: C1 is false — e.g., after the initial event4 choose event5; event5 is terminal and event8 never occurs — but this doesn't affect C2 because event4 has happened.)

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning: The statement C2 is ""Event4 happens or C1 holds."" The context explicitly says ""Initially, event4 happened,"" so ""Event4 happens"" is true. Therefore C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 is ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event8 always happens.""
- The context explicitly states that initially event4 happened.
- Therefore the disjunction ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"" is already satisfied by the fact that event4 did happen, independent of whether C1 is true.
- So C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- Hypothesis C2 says: whenever event3 happens, both event2 and event8 happen (C1).
- From the rules: 1 -> {2,3,7,9} and 3 -> {1,2,5,9}.
- Starting at initial event1, take 1 -> 3 (so event3 happens), then take 3 -> 1, then 1 -> 3, etc.
- This infinite run alternates 1 and 3 and never requires event2 or event8 to occur.
- Thus there exists a valid sequence where event3 occurs but C1 (event2 and event8) does not hold. Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event1 happens initially.
- From event1 one allowed next event is event3, and from event3 one allowed next event is event1. So the infinite sequence 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... is allowed by the given rules.
- In that sequence event3 does occur, but event2 never occurs and event8 never occurs.
- Therefore ""if event3 happens then (event2 and event8 happen)"" is not guaranteed by the rules (there is a counterexample), so C2 is False.
---
False

Counterexample (from the rules): start at event1 (given), then go to event3 (allowed after event1). From event3 go back to event1 (allowed after event3), then to event3 again, and repeat. This yields a run where event3 happens but neither event2 nor event8 ever occurs. Thus ""if event3 happens then event2 and event8 happen"" is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:

---
We must decide whether ""Event4 always happens"" (C1) holds; C2 is the negation.

Interpretation: ""Event4 always happens"" would mean every event in every possible sequence is event4 (or at least there's some step where it must be event4). The rules give possible next events, so to refute ""always"" it suffices to exhibit a legal step that is not event4.

Counterexample trace:
- Initially event4 (given).
- After event4, the rules allow either event6 or event7. Choose event7.
- event7 is not event4.

Thus there is a valid evolution (event4 → event7) where the next event is not event4, so ""Event4 always happens"" is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event4 always happens.""
- Initially event4 happened. But the rules say: after event4, the next event must be either event6 or event7. Therefore the very next event cannot be event4, so event4 cannot occur at every step.
- Thus C1 is false, so its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True"

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reason: start from the given initial event9. After event9 one allowed next event is event2. After event2 one allowed next event is event1. After event1 one allowed next event is event2. So there is a valid infinite run 9 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... that never contains event5. In that run event5 does not happen, and event2 does occur but is followed by event1 (not event5), so C1 (""if event2 happens then event5 happens"") is false. Hence the disjunction C2 (event5 happens or C1 holds) is false.
---
False

Counterexample: start at event9 (given), take event9 -> event2 (allowed), then event2 -> event1 (allowed), then event1 -> event2 (allowed), and repeat 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 ... forever. This infinite trace contains event2 but never contains event5, so C1 (""if event2 happens then event5 happens"") is false on this trace, and event5 does not happen either. Therefore ""event5 happens or C1 holds"" is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning sketch:
- C1 asserts ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" But the rules for event2 allow next = {1,4,5,6,8,9}, so event2 can be followed by event1 (or other non-5), hence C1 is not guaranteed (false).
- To falsify C2 = ""event5 happens or C1 holds"" we must exhibit a possible run where neither disjunct is true: no event5 occurs, and C1 fails.
- Counterexample run from the initial event9: 9 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... . All those transitions are allowed by the rules (9→1, 1→2, 2→1), this loop never visits event5, and event2 occurs but is followed by event1 (not event5), so C1 is false in this run.
- Therefore neither ""event5 happens"" nor ""C1 holds"" is guaranteed, so C2 is false."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning: C2 is ""Event7 does not happen OR event8 happens."" The context states initially event8 happened, so ""event8 happens"" is true. A disjunction with a true disjunct is true, so C2 is true (regardless of whether event7 later occurs).
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event7 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event8 happens."" So C2 is true iff (event7 never happens) OR (event8 happens at some point).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event8 happened."" That explicitly states event8 does happen.

Step 3 — reason about the disjunction:
- Since event8 happened (given), the second disjunct of C2 is true.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true, so C2 is true regardless of whether event7 ever happens.

Conclusion — final answer:
True
---
Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event7 does not happen.""
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event8 happens,"" i.e. ""Event7 does not happen OR event8 happens.""
- The problem states ""Initially, event8 happened."" So event8 does happen (at least once).
- Therefore the disjunction ""event7 does not happen OR event8 happens"" is true regardless of whether event7 ever occurs.

Goal: determine whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the rules.

C1 is ""Event7 does not happen"", so C2 is (Event1 happens) OR (Event7 does not happen). C2 is false exactly when Event7 does happen and Event1 never happens.

Start: event4 happened. From the rules:
- After event4, either event1 or event7 must happen.
- After event7, either event4, event5, event6, or event9 must happen.
Note these choices are non-deterministic (we may pick any allowed next event).

Consider this valid run that avoids event1:
- initial: event4
- choose event7 (allowed by ""after event4"")
- after event7 choose event4 (allowed)
- after event4 choose event7 again
Repeat 4 -> 7 -> 4 -> 7 ... forever.

This run contains event7 (so C1 is false) and never contains event1 (we always choose the branch that avoids event1). Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true; a counterexample run exists.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is the disjunction ""event1 happens OR C1 holds"", where C1 is ""event7 does not happen"". So C2 is false exactly when event7 does happen and event1 never happens.
- Initially event4 happened. From event4 the rules allow either event1 or event7 next.
- Choose event7 (allowed). From event7 the rules allow event4, event5, event6, or event9 next — none force event1.
- Choose event4 again (allowed). From this event4 we can again choose event7 (avoiding event1).
- Repeating the cycle 4 → 7 → 4 → 7 … is allowed by the rules and produces a trace in which event7 does occur and event1 never occurs.
- Therefore there exists a valid execution where event7 happens and event1 never happens, making C2 false.
---
False

Reasoning: initially event4 happens. From event4 you can choose event7. From event7 you can choose event4. Repeating 4 -> 7 -> 4 -> 7 ... yields a valid infinite sequence in which event7 occurs but event1 never occurs. Thus C1 (event7 does not happen) is false, and event1 does not happen either, so ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event9 happens. From 9 we can choose event6 (since 9 -> {2,6,8}).
- From 6 we can choose event4 (6 -> {1,4,7,8}).
- From 4 we can choose event6 (4 -> {6,7,8,9}).
- Thus we can loop 6 ↔ 4 forever: 9 → 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 … This run never visits event2 and never visits event1.
- Therefore C1 (""if event4 happens then event1 happens"") is false (counterexample: event4 occurs but event1 never does), and event2 does not happen in this run.
- Hence the disjunction C2 (C1 holds or event2 happens) is not guaranteed and is false.
---

---
You are asking whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is entailed by the given transition rules starting from initial event9.

C1 is ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens"" (i.e. 4 -> 1). To show C2 fails it suffices to give a reachable trace from the initial event9 in which C1 is false and event2 never occurs.

Construct a trace avoiding event2 and producing an occurrence of event4 that is not followed by event1:
- From 9 we may go to 6 (rules allow 9 -> 6).
- From 6 we may go to 4 (rules allow 6 -> 4).
- From 4 the allowed successors are {6,7,8,9} — none is 1, so the occurrence of 4 is not followed by 1, making C1 false.
- This trace (9 -> 6 -> 4 -> ...) contains 4 and never contained event2.

Thus there exists a possible run where C1 is false and event2 never happens, so ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Reasoning:
- Start at event3.
- From event3 you may go to event2 (allowed).
- From event2 you may go to event5 (allowed).
- From event5 you may go to event4 (allowed). After event4 nothing else happens.
- This run is 3 → 2 → 5 → 4, which contains event4 and never contains event8.
- Thus there exists a possible execution where C1 (event4 does not happen) is false and event8 does not happen, so C2 (C1 or event8) is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Counterexample: Start with event3 (given). From event3 we can have event7 (allowed). From event7 we can have event4 (allowed). This sequence contains event4 and never contains event8, so ""event4 does not happen"" is false and ""event8 happens"" is false, making C2 false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 one allowed next event is event7 (rule: after event3 → event2, event7, or event8).
- From event7 one allowed next event is event4 (rule: after event7 → event1, event2, event4, event6, event8, or event9).
- That produces a valid sequence 3 → 7 → 4 in which event4 happens and event8 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 (""event4 does not happen"") is false in that possible execution, and event8 is also false, so C2 (C1 or event8) is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible future sequence starting from the initial event, event6 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — we must decide whether that is true.

Step 2 — Extract relevant transitions (deduplicated):
- 1 → {3,4,6,7,9}
- 2 → {1,4,6,8,9}
- 3 → {1,4,5,6,7,8}
- 4 → {3,7,9}
- 5 → {1,8,9}
- 6 → {5,7,8,9}
- 7 → {1,2,5,6,8}
- 8 → {1,4,7,9}
- 9 → {1,2,3,4,6,8}
Initial event: 1.

Step 3 — Find a sequence avoiding event6:
- From 1 take 1 → 4 (allowed).
- From 4 take 4 → 3 (allowed).
- From 3 take 3 → 1 (allowed).
This yields the cycle 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → ... which never includes event6.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
Because there exists a valid infinite sequence starting at the initial event that never visits event6, event6 is not unavoidable. Thus C1 (""Event6 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
We must decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False. C1 says ""Event6 always happens."" Since the initial event is event1, C1 would require every subsequent (and the initial) event to be event6 — or at least that event6 occurs at every step. To falsify C1 it suffices to exhibit a permissible sequence in which some step is not event6.

From the rules:
- After event1 one may have event3 (allowed: 3,4,6,7,9).
- After event3 one may have event1 (allowed: 1,4,5,6,7,8).

Thus the infinite sequence 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... is allowed by the rules and never contains event6. Therefore event6 does not always happen, so C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True.
---
You ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true, where C1 is ""Event6 always happens.""

Interpretation: we check whether event6 is unavoidable (i.e., must happen in every possible future). If there exists any valid infinite sequence that never contains event6, then C1 is false and C2 is true.

From the rules (condensing unique transitions):
- 1 -> {3,4,6,7,9}
- 2 -> {1,4,6,8,9}
- 3 -> {1,4,5,6,7,8}
- 4 -> {3,7,9}
- 5 -> {1,8,9}
- 6 -> {5,7,8,9}
- 7 -> {1,2,5,6,8}
- 8 -> {1,4,7,9}
- 9 -> {1,2,3,4,6,8}
Initial: 1.

Construct a valid infinite run avoiding event6: choose 1 -> 3 (allowed), then 3 -> 1 (allowed), and repeat. The infinite loop 1,3,1,3,... never contains event6, and every step respects the given ""after ... either ..."" choices.

Therefore event6 is not forced to happen in all futures (C1 is false), so C2 is true.

Final answer: True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Initial event is event4.
- From event4 the allowed next events are: 2, 5, 7, 8, or 9.
- Follow any chain: none of the successor sets for events 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 include event3. Specifically:
  - 2 → {1,6}
  - 1 → {2,5,7,8}
  - 6 → {2,7,8,9}
  - 5 → {2,4,7,8,9}
  - 7 → {2,4,6}
  - 8 → {5,9}
  - 9 → {4}
  - 4 → {2,5,7,8,9}
- The only rule mentioning event3 is ""after event3, event4 must happen"", but there is no rule that allows reaching event3 from any reachable event.
- Therefore event3 cannot occur; C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 is ""Event5 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 holds, C2 is true regardless of whether event5 happens.

So C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: Event5 happens or C1 holds (i.e., event5 ∨ ¬event3).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules
- The initial event is event4.
- For every listed ""after eventX"" rule, the allowed next events are: {1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9} in various combinations — none of those rules ever list event3 as a possible next event.
- The only rule mentioning event3 is ""After event3, event4 must happen."" There is no rule that allows event3 to occur after any event.

Step 3 — reason about reachability
- Starting from the initial event4 and following the allowed transitions, there is no way to ever reach event3 because no transition produces event3.
- Therefore event3 cannot happen in any valid execution; C1 (¬event3) is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 is event5 ∨ C1. Because C1 is true, C2 is true regardless of whether event5 ever occurs.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event is event4.
- Check every rule for which events can follow another: none of the listed ""after X"" rules ever allow event3 as a next event. The only mention of event3 is ""After event3, event4 must happen"" (an outgoing constraint), but there is no incoming constraint that permits event3 to occur from any other event.
- Therefore event3 can never occur in any valid sequence starting from event4, so C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 is ""Event5 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event5 happens."

Reasoning summary:
- The context states ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 occurs in every scenario from the start.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds (event9 always happens), then event5 happens."" Since event5 already happens initially (independent of C1), the implication is true.
---
Reasoning:
- C1 says “Event9 always happens.”
- C2 says “If C1 holds, then event5 happens.”
- The context explicitly states that initially event5 happened. Therefore event5 occurs (in every possible scenario starting from the given initial condition), independent of whether C1 holds.
- Since event5 already happens, the implication “If C1 then event5” is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says ""Event9 always happens."" C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens.""
- The problem statement begins with ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 has already occurred (independent of any further assumptions).
- An implication ""If C1 then event5"" is true whenever the consequent (event5) is true. Since event5 is already true initially, the implication holds regardless of C1.

Therefore C2 is True."

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event6 always happens."" C2 = ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens.""
- From the rules: starting at event3, one allowed next event is event6. After event6 the allowed next events include event2. After event2 the allowed next events include event6. Thus there is a valid cycle 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> ... that never visits event7.
- This sequence satisfies C1 (event6 does happen, in fact repeatedly) while never producing event7, so C1 does not force event7 to occur.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
True

Reasoning summary:
- C1 asserts ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/event).
- From the rules: after event6 the next event must be one of {event2, event4, event5} — event6 is not allowed to follow event6. So you cannot have event6 at every step. Hence C1 is impossible (there is no valid execution in which event6 always happens).
- In classical logic an implication with an impossible (false) antecedent is vacuously true. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens"" is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 occurs. From the rules, after event3 one possible successor is event6, so the first transition could be event3 → event6.
- But after event6 the allowed successors are {event2, event4, event5}. Event6 is not among them, so it is impossible for event6 to occur again immediately after event6.
- Therefore ""Event6 always happens"" (C1) is impossible under the given transition rules.
- A conditional with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true: if C1 holds (which cannot happen), then any conclusion follows, including ""event7 happens.""
- Hence C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret hypothesis
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: If event8 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event8 happens then event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event8 happened.
- From the rules: after event8, event5 must happen.
- From the rules: after event5, event1 is allowed (event5 → event1 is listed).

So there is a valid sequence: event8 (initial) → event5 → event1. In that sequence event8 happens and event1 does happen, so C1 is false in that case.

Step 3 — conclusion about C2
- The antecedent (event8 happens) is true initially, but C1 can be false (as shown by the allowed sequence above). Therefore the implication ""if event8 then C1"" is not guaranteed and C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 happens.
- The rules state that after event8, event5 must happen.
- After event5, one allowed next event is event1 (choices: event1, event4, event6, event7, event8, or event9).
- Therefore there is a valid sequence event8 -> event5 -> event1, so event1 can happen.
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in this scenario, and since event8 does happen, the implication ""if event8 happens then C1 holds"" is also false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: If event8 happens, then C1 (i.e., event8 → ""event1 does not happen"").

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event8 happened.
- After event8, event5 must happen.
- After event5, event1 is allowed (after event5 either event1, event4, event6, event7, event8, or event9 must happen).

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence
- Starting with event8 → event5 → event1 is a valid sequence under the rules, so event1 can occur after event8.

Step 4 — conclude
- Since event8 actually happens (antecedent true) and event1 can occur (consequent false), the implication ""if event8 happens then event1 does not happen"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 asserts: if event5 happens then (event5 and event6) — equivalently, event5 implies event6.

Counterexample path from the initial event8 that contains event5 but never contains event6:
8 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> 8 -> 5 -> ...
All transitions are allowed by the rules (8→5, 5→1, 1→9, 9→8, etc.), and 6 never occurs on this path. Thus event5 can happen without event6, so C2 is false.

False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 is ""event5 happens and event6 happens"". C2 says ""if event5 happens then C1"", i.e. whenever event5 occurs, event6 must also occur.
- From the rules, starting at event8 we can do: 8 -> 5 (allowed). From 5 we can avoid 6 by choosing 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 9, then back to 1, etc. All those transitions are allowed and none include event6:
  8 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 9 → 1 → ...
- This gives a valid execution in which event5 occurs but event6 never occurs. Thus event5 does not force event6, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False.
---
We need to check whether ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., event5 implies both event5 and event6 happen — equivalently, event5 implies event6).

From the context:
- Initial event8 happened, and from event8 one possible next event is event5 (so event5 can occur).
- From event5 the possible next events include 1,2,3,6,7 — so event6 is possible but not forced.
- There is a cycle avoiding event6: 5 -> 1 (allowed) -> 9 (allowed) -> 5 (allowed). None of these forced transitions require event6, so once event5 occurs you can continue in this cycle forever without ever having event6 occur.

Therefore event5 can happen while event6 never happens, so ""event5 implies event6"" is not guaranteed. C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event7 happens.
- From event7 we can go to event4 (allowed).
- From event4 we can go back to event7 (allowed).
- From event7 we can go to event6 (allowed).
- From event6 we can go to event9 (allowed).

This sequence 7 → 4 → 7 → 6 → 9 shows both event4 and event9 can occur, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the premises: 7 -> {2,3,4,6} and 4 -> {7,8}; 6 -> {3,4,7,9};  (among others).
- One valid sequence of events is: 7 (initial) -> 4 (choose 4) -> 7 (from 4 choose 7) -> 6 (from 7 choose 6) -> 9 (from 6 choose 9).
- This sequence includes both event4 and event9, so C1 (event9 happens and event4 happens) can hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not necessarily true; it is false to assert C2.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happens.
- From event7 we may choose event4 (rule: after 7 → 2,3,4,6).
- From event4 we may choose event7 (rule: after 4 → 7,8).
- From that event7 we may choose event6 (rule: after 7 → 2,3,4,6).
- From event6 we may choose event9 (rule: after 6 → 3,4,7,9).

So one valid sequence is 7 → 4 → 7 → 6 → 9, which includes both event4 and event9. Therefore C1 (""event9 happens and event4 happens"") can be satisfied, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P).
- C2: ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds."" That is, event5 → (event1 → event1).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1 is always true because any statement of the form P → P is true regardless of the system's transition rules.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that after event5, a tautology (C1) holds. A tautology is true irrespective of any antecedent, so the implication event5 → C1 is true.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (event1 -> event1).
- C2 is ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds"" (event5 -> (event1 -> event1)).

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- event1 -> event1 is a logical tautology (any proposition implies itself), so C1 is always true in every model, independent of the given premises.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is event5 -> C1. Since C1 is always true, the implication event5 -> C1 is also always true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" — a logical tautology (p → p). It is always true regardless of any transition rules or which events occur.
- C2 is ""if event5 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, the implication in C2 is true whenever its consequent is true. Therefore C2 is true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""event6 happens or C1 holds"") must be true given the rules. C1 is ""event3 does not happen"", so C2 is false exactly if event3 happens and event6 never happens.

Construct a valid sequence consistent with the rules that makes C2 false:
- Initially event7 happens.
- After event7, event9 must happen → sequence: 7, 9.
- After event9 choose event5 (allowed: 4,5,6,7) → 7, 9, 5.
- After event5 choose event3 (allowed: 3 or 4) → 7, 9, 5, 3.

In this sequence event3 does happen (so C1 is false) and we have not had event6. None of the rules force event6 to occur at any point (after event3 we can choose event2 or event9 instead of event6), so it is possible to avoid event6 entirely. Thus there is a model of the rules where event3 occurs and event6 does not occur, making C2 false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happens. By the rule ""After event7, event9 must happen"", we get 7 -> 9.
- From 9 we can choose 5 (since after 9 one of 4,5,6,7 must happen). So 9 -> 5.
- From 5 we can choose 3 (after 5 either 3 or 4). So 5 -> 3. Thus event3 does happen.
- From 3 we can choose 2 (after 3 either 2,6, or 9). So 3 -> 2.
- From 2 we can choose 7 (after 2 either 1,3,7, or 9). So 2 -> 7.
- That returns us to 7, which forces 9, and we can repeat the choices 9 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> 9 -> ...
- This cycle contains event3 but never requires choosing event6. Therefore it is possible for event3 to occur while event6 never occurs.

Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which event3 happens and event6 does not, C2 (""event6 happens or event3 does not happen"") is not guaranteed. So C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (counterexample run):
- Start: 7 (given).
- 7 -> 9 (after 7, 9 must happen).
- 9 -> 5 (choose 5 from {4,5,6,7}).
- 5 -> 3 (choose 3 from {3,4}) — now event3 occurs, so C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
- From 3 choose 2 (3 -> 2).
- 2 -> 1 (2 -> 1 is allowed).
- 1 -> 4 (1 -> 4 is allowed).
- 4 -> 5 (4 -> 5 is allowed).
- 5 -> 3 (back to 3), and this cycle (3,2,1,4,5,3,...) can repeat indefinitely.

In this run event3 occurs but event6 never occurs, so ""event6 happens OR event3 does not happen"" is false. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are given that initially event7 happened. C1 asserts ""Event7 eventually happens"" — that is satisfied immediately by the initial event7. Therefore C1 is true, so ""C1 holds or event5 happens"" is true regardless of event5. Final answer: True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 states ""Event7 eventually happens.""
- The context says ""Initially, event7 happened."" Therefore C1 is true (event7 has already occurred).
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event5.
---
True

Reasoning:
- The problem states ""Initially, event7 happened."" That means event7 occurs at time zero, so ""event7 eventually happens"" (C1) is satisfied.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event5 ever occurs."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Counterexample (consistent with the rules): 4 → 2 → 9 → 5.
- From initial event4 choose event2 (allowed).
- After event2 choose event9 (allowed).
- After event9 choose event5 (allowed).
- After event5 no further events can happen.

In that valid sequence event2 does occur (so C1 is false) and event8 never occurs, so ""C1 or event8"" is false. Therefore C2 is not true.
---
False

Counterexample (valid sequence showing C2 can fail):
- Start: event4 (given).
- From event4 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event4 (allowed).
- Repeat 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 … indefinitely.

In this trace event2 does occur (so C1 is false) and event8 never occurs, so ""C1 holds or event8 happens"" is false. Hence C2 is not guaranteed.
---
We ask whether C2 (""Event2 does not happen OR event8 happens"") is guaranteed by the context.

Start at the given initial event: event4. From the rules:
- After event4, either event2, event3, or event6 must happen.
- After event2, either event4 or event9 must happen.
So one possible valid trace is: 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ... (repeat). This trace contains event2 and never includes event8, so C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false and ""event8 happens"" is false as well. Hence C2 can be false under the allowed transitions.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 is ""event6 happens or event5 happens.""
- C2 is the negation of C1: ""neither event6 nor event5 happens.""
- Start: event4 happened. From event4 one allowed next events are {event1, event3, event6}.
- Choose event1 (allowed). From event1 allowed next events are {event3, event5, event6, event7}.
- Choose event3 (allowed). From event3 allowed next events are {event1, event2, event9}.
- Choose event1 again, then event3, etc. The cycle 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 … is allowed by the rules and never involves event5 or event6.
- Therefore there exists a valid execution beginning at event4 in which neither event5 nor event6 ever happens, so C2 can be satisfied.

Thus C2 is True.

- Hypothesis C2: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., whenever event4 occurs, the immediately following event must be event5.

From the given transitions:
- After event7 → {4,5,9}
- After event4 → {1,2,3,5,6,7}

Starting from the initial event7, it is allowed to have event4 next (7 → 4). If event4 happens, the rules allow the next event to be event1 (4 → 1), which is not event5. That gives a valid sequence 7 → 4 → 1 consistent with the rules, so event5 is not forced immediately after event4.

Therefore C2 (that event4 implies event5 in the next state) is not guaranteed and is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):
- The transitions say: after event4, one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6, event7} must happen. That means event5 is a possible next event but not the only one.
- C2 asserts: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. whenever event4 occurs, event5 must happen in the next state.
- This is not guaranteed because after event4 other events (for example event1) may occur. A concrete counterexample starting from the given initial event7: 7 → 4 (allowed), then 4 → 1 (allowed). Here event5 does not occur next, so C1 fails in this branch.
- Therefore C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C2 says: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens in the next state"" (i.e., event4 ⇒ event5 next).
- From the context: ""After event4, either event1, event2, event3, event5, event6, or event7 must happen."" Event5 is only one possible outcome, not the only one.
- Counterexample from the given initial condition: Initially event7 happens. After event7, event4 may happen (allowed). After event4, event1 may happen (also allowed). That next state has event1, not event5, so C1 fails in this branch.
- Because there exists a permitted transition from event4 to a next state that is not event5, the implication ""event4 ⇒ event5 next"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'True': 1, 'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts that event2 happens in the next state.
- The context starts with event1 having happened. After event1, the next event must be one of {event4, event7, event8, event9}. Event2 is not allowed immediately after event1, so C1 cannot hold.
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C1 is impossible given the premises, ""If C1 holds, then event8 happens"" is true.
---
We want to know whether ""If C1 (event2 happens next) holds, then event8 happens"" is necessarily true given the transition rules.

1. C1 assumes: after the initial event1, event2 occurs next. The rules allow this: after event1, one of {event4,event7,event8,event9} must happen — wait: actually the context begins ""Initially, event1 happened."" and separately ""After event1, either event4, event7, event8, or event9 must happen."" So C1 itself (event2 next) is already inconsistent with the rule for event1. But even if we accept C1 as an assumed next-state occurrence (i.e., we force event2 to occur next), we must check whether event8 necessarily follows.

2. From event2 the rule is: after event2, one of {event3,event4,event6,event7,event8} must happen. Event8 is only one permitted option, not the only one.

3. A valid continuation that avoids event8 is: after event2 → choose event3; after event3 → event2 (this is forced). That yields an infinite loop 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 ... that never produces event8.

Therefore, C1 does not logically imply event8 (event8 is not inevitable). C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning: From the rules, after event2 the next event can be one of {event3, event4, event6, event7, event8}. Event8 is only one possible outcome, not guaranteed. For a concrete counterexample, choose event3 after event2 (allowed). After event3 the rule forces event2 again, producing a 2→3→2 loop with no requirement that event8 ever occur. Hence ""if event2 occurs then event8 happens"" does not follow."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event7 does not happen"") is false because the context states initially event7 happened.
- C2 is the implication ""If event1 happens, then event7 does not happen."" For an implication to be false you need a case where event1 happens but event7 does not hold.
- Starting from the initial event7, a possible sequence is 7 -> 3 -> 1 (since after 7 can come 3, and after 3 can come 1). That sequence has event1 happening while event7 has already occurred, so the consequent (""event7 does not happen"") is false when the antecedent is true.
- Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event7 does not happen."" But the context begins with ""Initially, event7 happened."" So C1 is false.
- C2 says ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event1 happens then event7 does not happen.
- There is a valid sequence where event1 does happen despite event7 having already happened: initially event7 -> (after event7) event3 -> (after event3) event1. So the antecedent (event1 happens) can be true while the consequent (event7 does not happen) is false.
- Therefore the implication C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event7 does not happen. (This is false because the context states “Initially, event7 happened.”)
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. In other words: if event1 occurs then event7 does not occur.

Step 2 — Can event1 happen?
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7, an event3 or event8 must happen.
- After event3, event1 is one possible next event.
- So there is a valid sequence: event7 → event3 → event1. Therefore event1 can happen.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 requires that whenever event1 happens, event7 does not happen.
- But event7 already happened initially, so “event7 does not happen” (C1) is false.
- Since event1 can happen while C1 is false, the implication “if event1 then C1” is false.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, after event5 the only possible next events are 4 or 6.
- There is a cycle that avoids event9: 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 5.
  - After 5 you may choose 6.
  - After 6 you may choose 8.
  - After 8 you may choose 5.
  - None of 5, 6, 8 is event9, and the cycle can be repeated indefinitely.
- Therefore it is possible for event5 to occur and for event9 to never happen afterward. That is a counterexample to the claim ""If event5 happens, then event9 happens"" (C1), so C1 does not hold in all executions.
- Consequently ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also false.
---
C1: ""If event5 happens, then event9 happens"" (interpreted as: when event5 occurs, the next event must be event9).

Check the transition rules: after event5, the only allowed next events are event4 or event6. There is no rule allowing event9 immediately after event5. So C1 is false whenever event5 actually occurs and is followed by 4 or 6.

Construct a concrete counterexample path from the initial event1:
- event1 -> event3 (allowed: after event1, event3 is allowed)
- event3 -> event9 (allowed: after event3, event9 is allowed)
- event9 -> event5 (allowed: after event9, event5 is allowed)
- event5 -> event4 (allowed: after event5, event4 is allowed)

Here event5 occurs but is followed by event4, not event9, so C1 is violated. Because C1 never becomes a guaranteed rule of the system, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.

Final answer: False"

Step 1 — interpret the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event5 does not happen"" (i.e. no further occurrences of event5).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there comes a time after which event5 never happens.

We must decide whether, from the given initial condition and transition rules, it is guaranteed that eventually event5 will cease to occur.

Step 2 — examine transitions relevant to event5
- From event6 (initial) you can go to event5.
- From event5 you can go to event2 (among others).
- From event2 you can go to event5 (2 → 5 is allowed).

Step 3 — produce a counterexample execution
Start: 6 → 5 → 2 → 5 → 2 → 5 → ...  
This is a valid infinite path allowed by the rules in which event5 occurs infinitely often. Therefore it is not guaranteed that there will be a time after which event5 never happens.

Conclusion
C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- From event3 we may pick event1 (3 -> 1 is allowed).
- From event7 we may also pick event1 (7 -> 1 is allowed).
- From event1 we may pick event6 (1 -> 6 is allowed).
- From event6 we may pick event2 (6 -> 2 is allowed).
- From event2 we get event1 (2 -> 1), returning to event1.

This yields a valid progression where both event3 and event7 occur but event4 never occurs (all choices avoid 4). Therefore ""if C1 then event4"" is not guaranteed.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The rules form a directed transition graph between events; initially event2 happens, and the transitions are:
  - 1 -> {4,6,8,9}
  - 2 -> {1}
  - 3 -> {1,4,5,9}
  - 4 -> {3,6}
  - 5 -> {1,3,6,8,9}
  - 6 -> {2,5,9}
  - 8 -> {1,2,3,5}
  - 9 -> {2,3,4}
  - 7 -> {1,2,3,5,6}
- There is no rule that produces event7 (no incoming edge to 7). Starting from the initial event2, no sequence of allowed transitions can ever produce event7.
- Therefore C1 (event3 and event7 both happen) is impossible / false in every allowed sequence. An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Hence C2 (""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"") is True.
---
True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Consolidating the rules, the allowed transitions are:
  1 -> {4,6,8,9}
  2 -> {1}
  3 -> {1,4,5,9}
  4 -> {3,6}
  5 -> {1,3,6,8,9}
  6 -> {2,5,9}
  7 -> {1,2,3,5,6}
  8 -> {1,2,3,5}
  9 -> {2,3,4}
  and initially event2 happens.
- From the rules, no event has a transition that produces event7 (i.e., no ""after X -> 7""). Since the only way events occur is by following these transitions starting from the initial event2, event7 can never occur in any permissible sequence.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 happens and event7 happens"") is impossible (false).
- An implication ""If C1 then event4"" is vacuously true when the antecedent (C1) cannot occur. Hence C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event4 happens or event4 happens,"" which is just ""Event4 happens.""
- C2 is the negation of C1, i.e., ""Event4 does not happen.""
- From the rules: initially event8 happens, and after event8 one possible next event is event2; after event2 one possible next event is event4. So a valid sequence is 8 → 2 → 4, meaning event4 can occur.
- Because event4 can happen, the statement ""Event4 does not happen"" (C2) is not true.
---
C1 simplifies to ""event4 happens"" (event4 or event4 is just event4). C2 is therefore ""event4 does not happen.""

From the context: initially event8 happens, and after event8 either event2, event3, or event5 must happen. From event2, event4 is allowed. So a sequence 8 -> 2 -> 4 is possible, so event4 can happen. Therefore C1 can be true, so C2 (""event4 does not happen"") is not entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""event3 eventually happens."" The context states ""Initially, event3 happened,"" so C1 is already true.
- C2 asserts ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually C1 is true). Since C1 holds now, C2 is true. 
(If ""eventually"" were interpreted as strictly future, we can still get event3 again via e3 -> e2 -> e4 -> e3, so C2 would still be true.)
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., ""eventually, (Event3 eventually happens).""

Step 2 — use the initial condition
- The context states: ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 has already occurred at the initial state.
- Therefore C1 is already true at the initial state (event3 does eventually happen — it already did).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that at some (possibly the current) time, C1 holds. Since C1 holds now, C2 is true.
- (Also, ""eventually"" is idempotent here: ""eventually eventually p"" is equivalent to ""eventually p"".)

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning: C1 asserts that event3 eventually happens. The context states ""Initially, event3 happened,"" so C1 is already true. C2 says that C1 eventually holds; since C1 is true at the initial state, it is also true that C1 eventually holds. Therefore C2 is True."

False

Counterexample (allowed by the rules): start with 7 (given), then take 7 → 3 → 2 → 6 (all moves permitted). After 6, avoid 1 and follow 6 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 3 → 2 → ... — this cycle (2,3,4,5,7,...) is permitted and never visits event1. Thus event6 can occur while event1 never happens, so ""if event6 happens then event1 always happens"" is false.

False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Start at event7 (given). From 7 we can go to 3. From 3 we can go to 4. From 4 we can go to 6. So event6 can occur (sequence 7 → 3 → 4 → 6).
- After event6 we may choose 2 (6 → 2). From 2 we can go to 3 (2 → 3) and then back to 2 (3 → 2), yielding the infinite cycle 2 ↔ 3 that never visits event1.
- Thus it is possible for event6 to occur while event1 never happens, so ""If event6 happens, then event1 always happens"" is false."

We must decide whether ""C1 holds or event6 happens"" is necessarily true given the rules and initial event7.

C1 is: ""If event9 happens, then event1 happens."" To refute C2 it suffices to find a valid sequence where C1 is false and event6 never happens.

Counterexample sequence (all steps follow the allowed transitions):
- Initially event7 (given).
- From 7 choose event9 (allowed: after 7 → {1,2,4,9}).
- From 9 choose event5 (allowed: after 9 → {1,2,3,5}).
- From 5 choose event3 (allowed: after 5 → {1,2,3,6}).
- From 3 choose event7 (allowed: after 3 → {1,2,4,5,6,7}).

This returns to event7, so the cycle 7 → 9 → 5 → 3 → 7 can repeat indefinitely. In that cycle event9 occurs, yet event1 never occurs (so C1 is false), and event6 never occurs. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds or event6 happens"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether C2 (""Event5 happens or Event1 does not happen"") must hold given the rules, starting with event3.

C2 would be false exactly if Event1 does happen and Event5 never happens. So we need only find one valid sequence (consistent with the ""after"" rules) starting from event3 that reaches Event1 while avoiding Event5.

From the rules:
- After event3 we can go to event6 (avoid event5).
- After event6 we can go to event2.
- After event2 we can go to event4 (avoiding event5).
- After event4 we can go to event7.
- After event7 we can go to event1.

This yields the sequence 3 → 6 → 2 → 4 → 7 → 1, which is allowed at every step and never includes event5. In that run Event1 happens and Event5 does not, so C2 is false in that model.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true. Final answer: False.
---
C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"".
C2 = ""Event5 happens or C1 holds"" = (Event5) OR (not Event1).

C2 would be false exactly when Event1 happens and Event5 never happens. So we need to see if, starting from event3, there is a possible sequence where Event1 occurs and Event5 never occurs.

From the rules (edges):
- 3 -> {5,6,7,8}
- 7 -> {1,4,6,9}
- 1 -> {2,5,6,8}
- 6 -> {2,8}
- 2 -> {3,4,5,8}

There is a path 3 -> 7 -> 1 that reaches Event1 without visiting Event5. Moreover we can avoid 5 forever by cycling: 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 ... This cycle (3,7,1,6,2) contains no event5, so Event1 occurs while Event5 never occurs.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- Start at event3. From 3 you can go to 6 (not 5).
- 6 → 2 (allowed).
- 2 → 4 (allowed).
- 4 → 7 (allowed).
- 7 → 1 (allowed).

So we have a path 3,6,2,4,7,1 that reaches event1 without ever visiting event5. After event1 you can continue choosing transitions that avoid 5 (e.g. 1→6→2→3→6→2→4→7→1 ...), producing an infinite run with event1 occurring and event5 never occurring.

Thus C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false on that run, and event5 does not happen, so C2 (""event5 happens or C1 holds"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event6 always happens.""  
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the next event may be one of {event2, event5, event6, event8}.
- From event5 the next event may be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- From event3 again you can choose among {2,5,6,8}.
- All other events have outgoing choices as well (so the process can continue indefinitely).

Step 3 — find a counterexample to ""event6 always happens""
- Start at the initial event3.
- Choose event5 (allowed from event3).
- From event5 choose event3 (allowed).
- Repeat: 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... indefinitely.

This valid infinite trace never includes event6, so event6 is not guaranteed to happen in all possible continuations.

- C1 is false (event6 does not always happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 says ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible continuation). So C2 is true exactly if there exists at least one valid sequence that never contains event6.

Starting from the initial event3, the rules give:
- From event3: next ∈ {2,5,6,8}.
- From event2: next ∈ {1,3,4,5,7,8}.
- From event3 again: next ∈ {2,5,6,8}.

So one valid infinite sequence is 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... This sequence is allowed by the rules (3→2 and 2→3 are both permitted) and it never includes event6. Therefore event6 does not happen in all possible executions, so ""Event6 always happens"" is false.

Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3, the allowed next events are {2,5,6,8}.
- Choose event5 (it is allowed). From event5 the allowed next events are {1,3,4}.
- Choose event3 (it is allowed). Now we are back at event3.
- This gives a valid infinite cycle 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 … that never visits event6.

Since there exists a valid sequence following the rules that never includes event6, event6 is not guaranteed to always happen. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event4 happened, so the next event must be event3 or event8 (rule: after event4, either event3 or event8).
- C1 says: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., after event1, event2 must occur).
- But the context gives: ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event8, or event9 must happen."" Thus after event1 event2 is only one possible outcome, not guaranteed.
- Counterexample trace from the next state: event4 -> event3 (next state). From event3 we can have event1. From that event1 we can have event3 (allowed). So event1 can be followed by event3, not event2, violating C1 in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event is event4, so the next state can be after event3 or after event8 (since after event4 either event3 or event8 must happen).
- Consider the next state after event3. From event3, event1 may occur (after event3, either event1, event2, event4, or event7 must happen). If event1 occurs, the rules for after event1 allow event2, event3, event4, event5, event8, or event9 — so event1 can be followed by something other than event2 (for example event3).
- Thus in the next state after event3, the claim C1 (""if event1 happens then event2 happens"") is not guaranteed, because there is a possible continuation where event1 is followed by event3, not event2.
- Because at least one possible next state violates C1, the statement ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false."

Votes: {'True': 2, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 requires that event8 happens (given true initially) and event9 never happens (C1).
- From the rules we have allowed transitions 8 -> 2, 2 -> 1, and 1 -> 8.
- Following the cycle 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 repeatedly avoids event9 indefinitely.
- Therefore it is possible for event8 to happen while event9 never occurs, so C2 can be satisfied.
---
False

Reasoning: initially event8 did happen (given). But from event8 you can go to event5, and from event5 one allowed next is event9 (8 -> 5 -> 9). So event9 can occur; ""Event9 does not happen"" is not guaranteed. Since C2 requires event9 never happens, C2 is not entailed by the context.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: Event9 does not happen.
- C2: Event8 happens and C1 holds (so: event8 happens and event9 never happens).
We must decide whether C2 can be true given the rules and the fact that initially event8 happened.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules relevant to avoiding event9
- After event8: allowed next = {2, 5, 6}.
- After event2: allowed next = {1, 4, 5}.
- After event1: allowed next = {2, 4, 5, 8}.
All of those options are non-9 choices. In particular, there is a 3-step cycle that uses only non-9 events:
8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8
- 8 to 2 is allowed.
- 2 to 1 is allowed.
- 1 to 8 is allowed.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since we start at event8 and can repeat the cycle 8 → 2 → 1 → 8 indefinitely, we can have event8 happen and never be forced to take event9. Therefore C2 is satisfiable.

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Counterexample (all steps follow the given rules):
- Initially event6 happens.
- After event6, event2 may happen (rule: after event6 → {1,2,9}).
- After event2, event8 may happen (rule: after event2 → {3,4,7,8}).
  So event8 has happened.
- After event8, event9 may happen (rule: after event8 → {1,3,4,6,9}).
  So event9 happens.
- After event9, either event7 or event8 must happen (rule: after event9 → {7,8}); choose event8.
  Thus event9 was followed by event8, not event7.

This shows a trace where event8 occurs but C1 (""if event9 happens then event7 happens"") is violated, so C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event9 happens, then event7 happens."" This would require that whenever a 9 occurs it must be followed by 7.
- But one rule says: ""After event9, either event7, or event8 must happen."" That explicitly allows 8 instead of 7, so C1 is not guaranteed in general.
- From the initial condition: event6 happens. From event6 we can go to event9 (rule: after event6, either 1, 2, or 9). From that event9 we can choose event8 (rule: after event9, either 7 or 8).
- Thus the trace 6 → 9 → 8 shows event8 happens while previously event9 occurred and was not followed by event7, contradicting C1. Therefore C2 (""If event8 happens, then C1 holds"") is false.

False

Reason: From the initial event6 we can reach event8 (6 -> 2 -> 8). After event8 we can go to event9, and after event9 the rules allow returning to event8 instead of going to event7. So we can follow 6 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 8 -> 9 -> ... forever, with 9 occurring but 7 never occurring. That is a valid run permitted by the rules that violates C1 after event8, so C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event8 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" i.e. ""Event2 happens in the next state, or Event8 does.""

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- From ""After event2, either event1, event6, or event8 must happen."" So the next state must be one of {event1, event6, event8}.

Step 3 — assess C2:
- Event2 is not among the allowed next events, so event2 does not necessarily happen in the next state.
- Event8 is one possible next event but not guaranteed (event1 or event6 could occur instead).

Because there is a valid next-state choice (e.g. event6) where neither event2 nor event8 happens, C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens or Event8 happens in the next state"") is entailed.

1) From the context: Initially, event2 happened.
2) Rule for event2: ""After event2, either event1, event6, or event8 must happen.""
3) Therefore the next state after the initial event2 can be event1, event6, or event8.

- C1 is ""event8 happens in the next state."" That is not guaranteed because next could be event1 or event6.
- C2 is ""event2 happens or C1 holds"" i.e. ""event2 or event8 happens next."" Event2 cannot be the immediate next state (it is not among event1,event6,event8), so the only way C2 could hold is if event8 happens. But event8 is not forced (event1 or event6 are possible).

Counterexample: take the next state = event1 (allowed). Then neither event2 nor event8 happens in that next state, so C2 is false in that trace.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event8 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e. ""Event2 happens in the next state OR Event8 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the relevant condition for the next state:
- We are told ""Initially, event2 happened.""
- The rule ""After event2, either event1, event6, or event8 must happen"" determines the immediate next state: it must be one of {event1, event6, event8}.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 for the next state:
- Event2 cannot be the immediate next state (it is not in {event1, event6, event8}).
- Event8 might be the immediate next state, but it is not forced (the next state could be event1 or event6 instead).
- Therefore the disjunction ""event2 next OR event8 next"" is not guaranteed true in all permitted next states (it fails if the next state is event1 or event6).

Conclusion:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Counterexample: start with event2 (given). After event2 choose event6 (allowed). After event6 choose event9 (allowed). This sequence contains event9 but never event3, so C1 (event9 does not happen) is false and event3 does not happen, making C2 (event3 happens or C1 holds) false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event9 does not happen"". So C2 is false exactly when Event9 does happen and Event3 never happens.
- From the given transitions we have:
  - 2 -> 6 is allowed.
  - 6 -> 9 is allowed.
  - 9 -> 8 is allowed, and 8 -> 9 is allowed.
- Thus there is a valid sequence starting at the initial event2 that reaches event9 and never visits event3, for example:
  2, 6, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, ...
  This sequence contains event9 and never contains event3, so C1 is false and ""Event3"" is false, making C2 false.
- Because such a valid sequence exists, C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C2 is ""event3 happens OR event9 does not happen"". For C2 to be false both event3 must never happen and event9 must occur.
- Start at the given initial event2. From event2 one allowed next event is event6 (after event2 → {1,4,5,6,7}).
- From event6 one allowed next event is event9 (after event6 → {1,4,8,9}).
- Thus the sequence 2 → 6 → 9 is allowed and contains event9 while never containing event3.
- Therefore there exists a valid sequence where event9 occurs and event3 does not, making C2 false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (counterexample trace):
- Start: event4 (given).
- From event4 we may choose event8.
- From event8 we may choose event2.
- From event2 we may choose event1 (avoiding event5).
- From event1 we may choose event4.
- Repeat choices (e.g., 4 → 8 → 2 → 1 → 4 → ...), always selecting transitions that avoid event5 (after event3 you can pick 4 rather than 5, after event2 pick 1/4/8 rather than 5, etc.).

This valid sequence includes event2 while never producing event5, so ""event2 does not happen"" is false and ""event5 happens"" is false in that execution. Therefore C2 (""event2 does not happen OR event5 happens"") is not guaranteed — hence False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event4 happens.
- From event4 choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event2 (allowed). Now event2 has occurred, so C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed) and repeat event1 -> event2 indefinitely. This path contains event2 but never visits event5 (every choice avoided event5).
- Thus there exists a valid sequence where event2 occurs and event5 never happens, making ""C1 or event5"" false.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed; answer: False.
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event2 does not happen OR event5 happens"") is guaranteed by the rules, given initial event4.

We can refute C2 by giving a valid sequence where event2 does occur and event5 never occurs.

Valid transitions used (from the context):
- after event4 → event6 is allowed.
- after event6 → event1 is allowed.
- after event1 → event2 is allowed.
- after event2 → event1 is allowed.

Concrete infinite execution avoiding event5:
event4 → event6 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
This sequence follows the allowed transitions and contains event2 while never containing event5. Thus C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false in this execution, and event5 does not occur, so C2 is false (the disjunction is false).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 states ""Event5 does not happen."" C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., from some point onward no event5 occurs).
- From the rules: event8 → event5 is allowed. Also event5 → event4 and event4 → event8 are allowed.
- Therefore there is a valid cycle 8 → 5 → 4 → 8 → 5 → 4 → ... that produces event5 infinitely often.
- Because such an infinite trace exists, it is not guaranteed that eventually event5 never happens. Hence C2 (that C1 eventually holds in all runs) is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event5 does not happen"" (i.e., event5 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is a point after which C1 is true (equivalently, from some time onward event5 never occurs).

Step 2 — examine the transitions (condensed)
- After 8: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
- After 5: {4,7,9}
- After 7: {3,5,8}
- (others exist, but these are enough)

Step 3 — find a counterexample run
- Start at event8 (given). Choose event5 next (allowed from 8).
- After event5, choose event7 (allowed).
- After event7, choose event5 (allowed).
Thus we can loop 5 → 7 → 5 → 7 … forever. Event5 occurs immediately and infinitely often, so C1 is false on this run and never becomes true later.

Conclusion
Because there is a valid execution where event5 happens (and even repeats forever), C1 does not eventually hold in all executions. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event8 (given).
- From 8 you can go to 5. From 5 you can go to 9. From 9 you can go to 2. From 2 you can go to 5. So there is a reachable cycle 8 → 5 → 9 → 2 → 5 that can be repeated indefinitely, producing event5 infinitely often.
- Therefore it is not guaranteed that “event5 does not happen” will eventually hold on all runs. Hence C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is false under the usual universal interpretation.

(If one instead interprets C2 existentially — “there exists a run after which event5 never occurs” — then C2 would be true, e.g. 8 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 ... avoids 5. But under the standard universal reading, C2 is False.)"

Reasoning: The context states ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 occurs regardless of whether C1 (event4 always happens) holds. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"" is true.

Answer: True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 (Event4 always happens) is false: from the initial event5 you can choose the cycle 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 8 ... and never hit event4, so event4 is not inevitable.
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"") is nevertheless true: event5 already happened initially, so any scenario (including any hypothetical one where C1 holds) has event5 occurring. Therefore the implication holds.

We want to decide whether C2, ""(If (event9 → event8) holds then event3 happens)"", is true given the initial event9 and the rules.

Assume C1 holds: event9 → event8. Because event9 happened initially, event8 must occur.

From event8 the rules allow choosing one of {event1, event6, event7}. Take the choice event1. From event1 the rules force event9. From that event9, the original rule requires one of {event1, event3, event6} — but we can again choose event1. Combined with C1, each time event9 occurs it yields event8, and from event8 we can again choose event1, producing a cycle:

9 (initial) → 8 (by C1) → 1 → 9 → 8 → 1 → 9 → ...

This infinite sequence satisfies all given rules and never produces event3. Because there is a valid execution consistent with all rules and C1 that avoids event3, event3 is not forced by C1. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event5 happened.
- From event5 you may choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 you may choose event5 (allowed).
- That gives an infinite 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 … cycle that never visits event4.
- Therefore event4 is not unavoidable (it does not always happen), so C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible run/event sequence event4 must occur).
- We have initial event5. From the rules: after event5 you can go to event1, and after event1 you can go to event5. So the infinite sequence 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ... is allowed and never contains event4.
- Because there exists an allowed run that never has event4, C1 does not hold.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible future from the initial state, event4 must occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., there is some possible future in which event4 never occurs).

Step 2 — examine transitions (only showing what matters for avoiding event4)
- From event5: can go to 1,3,4,7,8 — choose 1 to avoid 4.
- From event1: can go to 4,5,7,8,9 — choose 5 to avoid 4.
- From event5 we are back to the same choice as before.

Step 3 — construct an infinite path avoiding event4
- Start at initial event5, take 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ... forever.
- None of these steps visits event4, and at each step we have a nondeterministic choice that avoids 4.

Conclusion
- There exists a valid infinite execution starting from the initial event5 that never visits event4, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 occurs.
- From event3 we can choose event1.
- After event1, event6 must happen → event6 occurs.
- After event6 we can choose event3.
- From that event3 we can choose event5.
- After event5 we can choose event2 → event2 occurs.

This execution produces both event6 and event2, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
---

---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 asserts: ""event6 happens and event2 happens."" So C2 is true only if it is impossible for both event6 and event2 to occur.

We can construct a valid sequence from the rules where both occur:
- Initially event3 happens.
- From event3 choose event1.
- After event1, event6 must happen. (So event6 occurs.)
- After event6 choose event3.
- From that event3 choose event5.
- After event5 choose event2. (So event2 occurs.)

Thus there is a legal sequence in which both event6 and event2 happen, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We can refute C2 by producing a valid run where event7 occurs but C1 (event5 ⇒ event8) fails.

Start from the initial event3 and follow allowed transitions:
- 3 → 2 (allowed)
- 2 → 7 (allowed)  — event7 has now happened
- 7 → 5 (allowed)  — event5 happens
- 5 → 4 (allowed)
- 4 → 1 (allowed)
- 1 → 3 (allowed)
- 3 → 2 (allowed)
- 2 → 7 (allowed)
… and so on, repeatedly cycling while always avoiding choosing event8.

This is a legal sequence under the given rules: after each event we chose one of the permitted next events. In this run event7 occurs, event5 occurs, but event8 never occurs (we can always avoid selecting 8 because every state that can lead to 8 also has other allowed successors). Thus C1 is false in a run where event7 happens, so ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the rules, starting at the initial event3 we can reach event7 (3 -> 4 -> 7).
- After 7 we can follow 7 -> 5. After 5 choose 4, then 1, then 3, then 5 again, forming the cycle 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5.
- That cycle never includes event8, and at each choice the transitions used are allowed by the given rules.
- Thus there is a run in which event7 occurs, event5 occurs, and event8 never occurs — so C1 (""if event5 then event8"") is not guaranteed even when event7 has happened.
- Therefore C2 (""if event7 happens, then C1 holds"") is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 states: if event7 happens, then C1 holds. C1 states: if event5 happens, then event8 happens.
- To disprove C2 it suffices to produce a run where event7 occurs, event5 later occurs, and after that event8 can be avoided.
- From the rules: after event3 we can go to event2; after event2 we can go to event7. So we can reach event7 (3 -> 2 -> 7).
- From event7 we can go to event5 (7 -> 5). From event5 we can go to event4 (5 -> 4), and from event4 back to event5 (4 -> 5). That yields the cycle 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 ... which never forces event8 (4 can go to 8 but it may choose 5 instead).
- Hence there is a valid execution where event7 happens, event5 happens afterwards, and event8 never happens. That makes C1 false in that execution, so C2 (which requires C1 whenever 7 happens) is false.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context we have transitions:
  9 -> {7,8}
  7 -> {1,2,3,4,5,6}
  1 -> {5,6,7}
  6 -> {2,5,7,8}
  2 -> {5,9}
  (and 8,3,4,5 transitions as given)
- We need to check whether ""Event5 happens or event4 happens"" must inevitably occur starting from event9.
- It suffices to find a possible (legal) sequence that never hits event4 or event5. From 9 pick 7; from 7 pick 1; from 1 pick 6; from 6 pick 2; from 2 pick 9. This yields a cycle 9 -> 7 -> 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 9 that never includes 4 or 5.
- Since there is a valid infinite execution that avoids both event4 and event5, the statement ""Event5 happens or event4 happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

False

Reasoning (sketch):
- Start at event9 (given). Choose 9 -> 5 so event5 happens.
- From 5 choose 5 -> 2 (allowed).
- From 2 the only choice is 2 -> 1.
- From 1 choose 1 -> 4 (avoid 7).
- From 4 choose 4 -> 6 (avoid 3 and 7).
- From 6 choose 6 -> 1 (avoid 3 and 7) and then repeat the cycle 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 ...

This infinite path 9,5,2,1,4,6,1,4,6,... contains event5 but never contains event3 or event7. Therefore ""If event5 happens, then (event7 or event3 happens)"" is not guaranteed. C2 is False.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""If event5 happens, then C1 holds"") is entailed by the given transitions. C1 is ""event7 happens or event3 happens"" (i.e., at some point 7 or 3 occurs).

Look for a counterexample trace starting from the initial event9 where event5 occurs but neither 3 nor 7 ever occur afterwards.

From the rules:
- 9 -> {2,3,4,5,6,7}
- 5 -> {2,3,4,8}
- 8 -> {2,7,9}
- 2 -> {1,3}
- 1 -> {2,4,5,7,8}
- 4 -> {1,2,5,6,8,9}
- 6 -> {1,3,5,7,8,9}

We can choose transitions to avoid 3 and 7 entirely. One such infinite cycle:
9 -> 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> ... 
(all these steps are allowed by the rules and none of the visited nodes are 3 or 7).

This trace starts at initial 9, includes event5, and yet never visits event3 or event7, so C1 is false on that trace. Therefore C2 (""if event5 happens then C1"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event5 occurs. From event5 we can go to event3.
- From event3 we can go to event2.
- From event2 we can go to event1.
- From event1 we can go back to event5.

This gives a cycle 5 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 5 that never involves event6, so it is possible to continue forever without event6 occurring. Therefore ""Event6 always happens"" (C1) is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event6 always happens."" (i.e., every allowed continuation from the initial state must include event6 at some point).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — cleanly state the transition rules (unique rules):
- Start: event5 has happened.
- 5 -> {3,4,6,8,9}
- 3 -> {2,5,9}
- 2 -> {1,3,4,5,6,8,9}
- 1 -> {2,3,5,6,7}
- 4 -> {3}
- 8 -> {3,4,5,7}
- 9 -> {1,2,3,4,6}
- 7 -> {3,4,6,8,9}
- 6 -> {3,5,8,9}

Step 3 — look for a continuation that avoids event6 forever:
- From the start 5 we can pick 3 (5 -> 3).
- From 3 pick 2 (3 -> 2).
- From 2 pick 3 (2 -> 3).
This yields the infinite loop 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> ... which never visits event6 and respects all given rules.

Conclusion:
Because there exists a valid continuation from the initial state that never includes event6, C1 (""Event6 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event6 always happens."" (i.e., every valid future from the initial state includes an event6 at some point)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of C1)

Step 2 — Examine the transition rules (condensed)
- 5 → {3,4,6,8,9}
- 3 → {2,5,9}
- 2 → {1,3,4,5,6,8,9}
- 4 → {3}
- 8 → {3,4,5,7}
- 7 → {3,4,6,8,9}
- 9 → {1,2,3,4,6}
- 1 → {2,3,5,6,7}
- 6 → {3,5,8,9}

Step 3 — Find a path that avoids event6 forever
- Starting from the given initial event5, 5 → 3 is allowed.
- From 3, 3 → 5 is allowed.
- So we can loop 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → ... indefinitely without ever visiting event6.

Conclusion
- Since there exists a valid infinite sequence starting from the initial event5 that never visits event6, C1 is false, so C2 (the negation) is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1 is ""Event5 happens and event5 happens"", which is logically equivalent to ""Event5 happens"".
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"" (i.e., C1 → event5).

Step 2 — logical simplification:
- From C1 (event5 ∧ event5) by conjunction elimination we get event5.
- Therefore C1 implies event5.

Conclusion:
- C2 is true (it is a logical consequence / tautology given the definition of C1).

True
---
True

Reasoning: C1 is simply ""event5 happens"" (since it's event5 AND event5). C2 states ""if C1 then event5"", i.e. ""if event5 then event5"", which is a tautology and therefore true regardless of the rest of the context.
---
Step 1 — identify the pieces:
- C1 is ""Event5 happens and event5 happens"", which is equivalent to simply ""Event5 happens"".
- C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"", i.e. (event5) → (event5).

Step 2 — logical evaluation:
- The implication (event5) → (event5) is a tautology: whenever the antecedent holds, the consequent holds (they are the same). Even if the antecedent were false, the implication would still be true by truth-table of implication.

(For completeness: event5 is reachable from the initial event1 via event1 → event9 → event5, so C1 is satisfiable, but that is not required to judge the implication.)

Final answer:
True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- The initial event is event8.
- The rules for transitions after event8 repeatedly state the next event must be one of {event1, event5, event9}.
- Event4 is not among the allowed successors of event8, so event4 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (event4 happens next) is false, and C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 occurred.
- The rules state that after event8 the next event must be one of {event1, event5, event9}.
- Event4 is not among those allowed next events, so Event4 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event4 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and transition rules:
- Initially, event8 happened.
- The rules state (repeatedly) that ""After event8, either event1, event5, or event9 must happen.""

Step 3 — apply the rule to the ""next state"":
- Immediately after event8, the allowed next events are only {event1, event5, event9}. Event4 is not among them, so Event4 cannot happen in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to evaluate C2: ""If event3 happens, then event2 does not happen."" That is, does every possible sequence (starting from initial event8) that contains event3 never contain event2?

Find a counterexample sequence from the rules:
- Initially event8 happened.
- From event8 we can go to event3 (8 -> 3).
- From event3 we can go to event9 (3 -> 9).
- From event9 we can go to event2 (9 -> 2).

This yields the sequence 8, 3, 9, 2, in which event3 occurs and event2 later occurs. That violates the implication in C2.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reason: From the initial event8 we can follow allowed transitions 8 → 3 (after event8, 3 is allowed), then 3 → 9 (after event3, 9 is allowed), then 9 → 2 (after event9, 2 is allowed). This produces a sequence where event3 happens and event2 also happens, so C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false in that case. Therefore the implication C2 (""if event3 happens then C1 holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 = ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2 = ""If event3 happens, then Event2 does not happen.""

From initial event8, event3 can occur (8 → 3 is allowed). From event3, event9 is allowed (3 → 9). From event9, event2 is allowed (9 → 2). So the sequence 8, 3, 9, 2 is permitted, meaning event3 can occur while event2 later occurs. That violates C2, so C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The rules for ""After event8"" state the next event must be one of: event2, event3, or event5.
- Therefore event8 cannot happen in the immediate next state.
- C1 (""event8 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event8 does not happen next).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event8 happened.
- The rule ""After event8, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen"" applies to the next state.

Step 3 — reasoning:
- From the rule, the next event after initial event8 must be one of {event2, event3, event5}.
- Event8 is not among these, so C1 (event8 happens next) is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- Initially event3 happened. From the rules, after event3 the next event can be either event1 or event9.
- C1 asserts: ""If event4 happens, then event9 happens"" (i.e., after event4 the only possible successor would have to be event9).
- But the rules say: after event4, the next event can be event1, event5, event8, or event9 — so event9 is only one possible successor, not guaranteed.
- Consider the next state being event1 (which is allowed after the initial event3). From event1, event4 is allowed next; then after event4 it is allowed to have event1 (not event9). That is a concrete counterexample showing C1 is not true in that next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event9 happens."" (i.e., every time event4 occurs it must be followed by event9.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" — we must check whether C1 is true in the state immediately after the initial state.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- After event4, the allowed next events are: event1, event5, event8, or event9. So event9 is only one possible successor of event4, not the only one.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample reachable from the initial state
- Initially event3 happened. From event3 we can go to event1 (one allowed choice).
- From event1 we can go to event4 (allowed).
- From event4 we can go to event1 (allowed) — here event4 was not followed by event9.

This reachable sequence (event3 → event1 → event4 → event1) shows C1 is false in the next state (and in general), because event4 can be followed by something other than event9.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event9 happens."" (i.e. whenever event4 occurs its immediate successor must be event9.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" We start at initial event3; the next state is whichever event follows that initial event. C2 claims that in that next state C1 is true (i.e. from that state, whenever event4 occurs its successor must be event9).

Step 2 — possible next events from the initial state
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event9. So the next state is either event1 or event9.

Step 3 — exhibit a counterexample that falsifies C1 (hence C2)
- From event3 take the successor event1 (allowed).
- After event1, event4 is allowed (after event1, either event4, event5, or event7 must happen).
- After event4, event1 is allowed (after event4, either event1, event5, event8, or event9 must happen).
So the sequence event3 → event1 → event4 → event1 is valid under the given rules. This shows a reachable occurrence of event4 followed by event1 (not event9), so C1 is false in that branch.

Because the next-state could be event1 and in that next-state C1 can be violated (as shown), C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Initially event3 happens.
- From event3 we may choose event7 (allowed).
- From event7 we may choose event3 (allowed) instead of event4.
- Repeat 3 → 7 → 3 indefinitely, never taking any transition to event8.

In this possible execution:
- event7 does occur but is followed by event3 (not event4), so C1 (""if event7 happens then event4 happens"") is false.
- event8 never happens.

Thus both disjuncts of C2 are false in this model, so C2 is not guaranteed.
---
False

Reason: From the rules, after event3 one possible next event is event7, and after event7 one possible next event is event3. So there is a valid infinite trace 3 → 7 → 3 → 7 → ... that never produces event4 and never produces event8. In that trace event7 occurs but event4 does not follow, so C1 (""if event7 happens then event4 happens"") is not true, and event8 never occurs. Therefore ""C1 holds or event8 happens"" is not guaranteed.
---
We ask whether C2 = (C1 holds) OR (event8 happens) must be true given the rules.

C1 is: ""If event7 happens, then event4 happens."" To show C2 is false it suffices to exhibit a valid run (consistent with the ""after"" rules and the initial event3) in which event7 occurs, event4 never occurs, and event8 never occurs. Such a run will make C1 false and event8 false, so C2 false.

From the rules:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event7 is one allowed next event.
- After event7, event3 is one allowed next event.
Thus a valid infinite trace is: event3 (initial) → event7 → event3 → event7 → ... . This trace never visits event4 and never visits event8, yet event7 does occur. Therefore C1 is false in this trace, event8 does not happen, and so C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reason: After event1 (given) choose event8 (allowed). After event8, choose event4 (allowed). After event4, choose event3 (allowed). That shows event8 can occur while C1 (""if event4 happens then event5 happens"") fails (event4 was followed by event3, not event5). Hence C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens."" (i.e. 4 ⇒ 5)
- C2: ""If event8 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. 8 ⇒ (4 ⇒ 5))

Step 2 — examine the rules (unique transitions)
- Initially: event1.
- After 1: {2,3,4,6,7,8}
- After 2: {1,3,4,6,7,8,9}
- After 3: {2,4,9}
- After 4: {3,5,8}
- After 5: {1,2,4,6,7,9}
- After 6: {2,5,9}
- After 7: {1,3,4,6,8,9}
- After 8: {2,4,5}
- After 9: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2
- Start at the initial event1. From 1 we can go to 8 (allowed).
- From 8 we can go to 4 (allowed).
- From 4 we can go to 3 (allowed) — note 3 ≠ 5, so event4 is followed by something other than event5.

This sequence (1 → 8 → 4 → 3) contains event8, yet C1 (that every occurrence of 4 is followed by 5) is violated (here 4 is followed by 3). Therefore C2 (which asserts that whenever event8 happens, C1 holds) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens.""
- C2: ""If event8 happens, then C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to C1
- The rules say: ""After event4, either event3, event5, or event8 must happen.""
- That means event5 is not guaranteed after event4 (event3 or event8 could occur instead). So C1 is false.

Step 3 — examine C2 given C1
- C2 asserts that whenever event8 happens, C1 is true.
- But C1 is already false (independent of whether event8 occurs), and event8 is reachable (from the initial event1, event8 is an allowed next event). So there are runs where event8 happens while C1 is false.
- Therefore the implication in C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning: From the initial event8 we may choose event1 next (8 -> 1). After event1 we can have event3 (1 -> 3). After event3 we can have event2 (3 -> 2). Thus a valid sequence 8 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 makes both event1 and event2 happen, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
We start at event8. From the rules:
- After event8, event1 is allowed.
- After event1, event3 is allowed.
- After event3, event2 is allowed.

Thus one valid sequence is: 8 → 1 → 3 → 2, in which both event1 and event2 occur. So C1 (event1 and event2 happen) can be true. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reason: Start at event8, then choose event1 (allowed). From event1 choose event3 (allowed). From event3 choose event2 (allowed). That yields both event1 and event2, so C1 can hold; therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the propositions
- C1: ""Event8 happens or event5 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event8 nor event5 ever happens / C1 is not guaranteed).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules
From the rules we have edges:
1 → {3,4,6}
2 → {3,4,5}
3 → {4,5,6,7,8}
4 → {1,2,8,9}
5 → {2,6,7,9}
6 → {2,3,4,5,7}
7 → {1,3,6,8}
8 → {1,4,5,7,9}
9 → {3,6}

Step 3 — find a sequence avoiding events 5 and 8
Starting at event1, the cycle 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 is allowed by the rules:
- 1 → 3 (allowed)
- 3 → 4 (allowed)
- 4 → 1 (allowed)

This cycle avoids both event5 and event8 and can be repeated indefinitely, so there is a valid event sequence from the initial state in which neither event5 nor event8 ever occurs.

Step 4 — conclude truth value
Because there exists a valid sequence where neither event5 nor event8 happens, C1 is not guaranteed (C1 does not hold). Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Short answer: False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event8 happens or event5 happens.""
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event5 nor event8 ever happens).
- From the rules, starting at event1 we can choose:
  - 1 -> 3 (allowed),
  - then 3 -> 5 (3 can be followed by 5).
  Thus event5 can happen in a valid sequence from the initial event1, which makes C1 true in that sequence.
- Because there exists a valid sequence where C1 holds, the claim ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not true.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning: From event1 we can choose event3 (allowed), and from event3 event5 is allowed. That yields a valid sequence where event5 occurs, so ""Event8 or event5 happens"" (C1) can be true — hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 claims both event4 and event8 occur.
- From the initial event3, one allowed next event is event8 (after event3, event2/event7/event8).
- After event8, one allowed next event is event4 (after event8, event1/event2/event4/event7).
- So there is a valid sequence: event3 -> event8 -> event4, in which both event8 and event4 happen.
- Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
We start with event3. After event3, either event2, event7, or event8 must happen. Choose event8. After event8, either event1, event2, event4, or event7 must happen. Choose event4. This yields a sequence 3 → 8 → 4 in which both event8 and event4 occur, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reason: Starting from the initial event3, choose the allowed transitions event3 -> event8 (allowed) and then event8 -> event4 (allowed). That yields both event8 and event4, so C1 can hold. Therefore ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not guaranteed, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypotheses:
- C1: Event3 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event3 does not happen next).

Step 2 — use the facts:
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7, the allowed next events are: event1, event2, event4, event5, or event8. Event3 is not among them.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses:
- C1: Event3 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event3 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The rule ""After event7, either event1, event2, event4, event5, or event8 must happen."" Event3 is not among these options.

Step 3 — conclude:
- From event7, event3 cannot occur in the next state, so C1 is false and C2 (the negation) is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning: Initially event7 happened. The rules say that after event7 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event8}. Event3 is not among those, so C1 (""event3 happens in the next state"") is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- We start with event8 (given).
- From event8, event3 is explicitly allowed next (after event8 → event3).
- From event3, event2 is allowed (after event3 → event2).
- From event2, event4 is allowed (after event2 → event4).
- From event4, event3 is allowed (after event4 → event3).

So there is a valid cycle 8 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 4 → ... that never includes event1 but does include event3. In that run C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false and ""event1 happens"" is also false, so C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (sketch):
- C2 is ""event1 happens OR event3 does not happen."" To show C2 can be false, find a valid sequence where event3 happens and event1 never happens.
- Start from the given initial event8. Choose transitions that avoid event1:
  8 -> 3 (allowed), then 3 -> 5, 5 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 3.
- This yields the cycle 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 which repeats indefinitely; none of these steps force event1.
- Thus there exists a valid run where event3 occurs and event1 never occurs, making C2 false.
---
We need to check whether ""Event1 happens or Event3 does not happen"" must hold given the rules and initial event8.

Counterexample (a valid sequence under the rules):
- Start: 8 (initial).
- 8 -> 3 (allowed: {1,3,5,6,7,9}).
- 3 -> 5 (allowed: {1,2,5,7,8,9}).
- 5 -> 7 (allowed: {2,7,8}).
- 7 -> 4 (allowed: {4,5,8,9}).
- 4 -> 3 (allowed: {3,5,6,9}).

This yields an infinite cycle 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 4 -> 3 ... that never includes event1, while event3 does occur. Thus C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false and event1 also does not happen, so C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is false in this model.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event8 happened.
- From event8 we can have event3 (rule: after event8 → event3,5,6,9).
- From event3 we can have event1 (rule: after event3 → event1,5,6,8,9).
- From event1 we can have event7 (rule: after event1 → event5,6,7,8).
- From event7 we can have event9 (rule: after event7 → event1,2,3,4,5,9).

Thus there is a valid sequence 8 → 3 → 1 → 7 → 9 where event1 occurs and later event9 occurs. That is a counterexample to ""If event1 happens, then event9 does not happen,"" so C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning: After event1, event5 is allowed. After event5, event9 is allowed. So there is a possible sequence 1 → 5 → 9, meaning event1 can be followed by event9. Therefore ""If event1 happens, then event9 does not happen"" is not guaranteed.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 = ""Event9 does not happen."" C2 = ""If event1 happens, then event9 does not happen.""
- From the context the possible transitions include: 8 -> {2,3,5,6,9}, 3 -> {1,5,6,8,9}, 1 -> {5,6,7,8}, 5 -> {2,4,6,7,9}, etc.
- Starting at the initial event8, one allowed sequence is: 8 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 9.
  - 8 can be followed by 3.
  - 3 can be followed by 1.
  - 1 can be followed by 5.
  - 5 can be followed by 9.
- This exhibits a case where event1 occurs and later event9 also occurs, so C1 is false in that case. Therefore the implication in C2 does not hold in general.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- Initially event5 happens.
- The rule for event5 is: after event5 either event3 or event9 must happen next.
- Therefore the next state must be event3 or event9. In neither case is event8 happening in that next state.
- C1 is ""Event8 does not happen."" C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., event8 does not happen in the next state.
- Since the next state is limited to event3 or event9 (neither is event8), C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Initial state: event5 happened. The transition rule for event5 is: after event5, the next event must be either event3 or event9. Neither event3 nor event9 is event8, so event8 cannot occur in the next state. Therefore C1 (""Event8 does not happen"") holds in the next state.

True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happened.
- From the rules, ""After event5, either event3, or event9 must happen."" (no rule allows event8 immediately after event5).
- Therefore in the next state only event3 or event9 can occur, so event8 does not happen in the next state.
- Hence C1 (event8 does not happen) holds in the next state, so C2 is True."

Step 1 — Identify hypotheses:
- C1: event7 -> event6.
- C2: event6 -> C1, i.e. event6 -> (event7 -> event6).

Step 2 — Logical observation:
For any propositions A and B, A -> (B -> A) is a tautology. Intuitively:
- If A is true, then (B -> A) is true because A is true regardless of B.
- If A is false, A -> ... is vacuously true.

Apply with A = “event6” and B = “event7”: event6 -> (event7 -> event6) is always true, independent of the listed event rules.

Therefore C2 is True.

True
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 says: after event7 the next event must be event6. The rules for event7 allow next = {1,2,5,6,9}, so C1 is not guaranteed by the rules.
- C2 says: if event6 happens then C1 holds. To refute C2 we need a valid sequence where event6 occurs but C1 fails.
- Counterexample sequence starting from the given initial event2:
  event2 -> event1 (allowed after event2)
  event1 -> event6 (allowed after event1)
  event6 -> event7 (allowed after event6)
  event7 -> event1 (allowed after event7, and this is not event6)
- In this sequence event6 occurs, but event7 is followed by event1 (not event6), so C1 is false in that scenario. Hence C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible continuation from the initial condition, event9 will eventually occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event9 is not inevitable).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (deduplicated)
- From 3 → {2,4,5,8}
- From 2 → {3,6,7,8}
- From 6 → {1,2,3,4,7,8,9}
- From 7 → {1,2,5,9}
- From 8 → {1,6}
- From 4 → {1,2,5,9}
- From 5 → {1,2,6}
- From 1 → {2,5,6,8,9}
- From 9 → {1,2,3,4,7,8}

Initial event: event3 happened.

Step 3 — find a path that avoids event9
- From 3 you can go to 2.
- From 2 you can go back to 3.
- Thus the infinite sequence 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... is allowed and never visits event9.

Conclusion
- Because there exists a valid continuation from the initial state that never reaches event9, C1 is false, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event9 always happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event9 does not always happen).

Step 2 — examine the transitions:
- Initially event3 occurred.
- From 3 you can go to {2,4,5,8}.
- From 2 you can go to {3,6,7,8}.
(Other transitions exist but these two suffice.)

Step 3 — find a sequence avoiding event9:
- From the initial 3 choose 3 -> 2.
- From 2 choose 2 -> 3.
- Repeat 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 ... forever.

This infinite alternation never visits event9 (both 3 and 2 have outgoing choices that keep you inside {2,3}).

Conclusion:
- There exists a possible (infinite) run starting at the initial event3 that never includes event9, so event9 is not guaranteed to occur.
- Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event3 (given).
- From event3 one possible next event is event2.
- From event2 one possible next event is event3.
- Thus we can follow the cycle 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... indefinitely.
- This infinite path never visits event9, so event9 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible continuation.
- Therefore C1 (""Event9 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need C2 ≡ (C1) OR (event1 happens) to hold in every possible run starting from the given initial event6. C1 is ""if event8 happens then event2 happens"" (i.e. every time 8 occurs it must be followed by 2).

1. C1 is not forced by the rules: after event8 the allowed next events are {2,3,4,7,9}, so 8 can be followed by 3 (or 4,7,9) instead of 2. Thus C1 can be false in some run.

2. To falsify C2 we must exhibit a run where C1 is false and event1 never occurs. Starting from the initial event6, take:
   6 -> 8 (allowed), then 8 -> 3 (allowed). This single occurrence 8 -> 3 is a counterexample to C1.
   Continue avoiding event1: 3 -> 7, 7 -> 9, 9 -> 6 (all allowed choices), returning to 6 and repeating the cycle 6->8->3->7->9->6...
   This infinite run contains 8 followed by a non-2, and never contains event1.

Therefore there exists a model where C1 is false and event1 never happens, so C2 is not guaranteed. Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 (""If event8 happens then event2 happens"") would be false if there's a possible occurrence of event8 followed by something other than event2.
- From the context: after event6 one possible next event is event8, and after event8 one possible next event is event9 (since after event8 either 2,3,4,7, or 9 may happen). So the sequence 6 -> 8 -> 9 is possible, showing event8 can occur without event2 following; thus C1 can be false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"". To falsify C2 we need a run where C1 is false and event1 never occurs. The infinite run 6 -> 8 -> 9 -> 7 -> 9 -> 7 -> ... is allowed by the rules, contains event8 followed by 9 (so C1 is false) and never contains event1. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- C1 claims: whenever event8 happens, event2 happens next. But the rules say after event8 one of {event2, event3, event4, event7, event9} may happen — so event3 (for example) is allowed instead of event2.
- Starting from the initial event6, build a permitted cycle that avoids event1 and violates C1:
  - 6 -> 8 (allowed),
  - 8 -> 3 (allowed),
  - 3 -> 7 (allowed),
  - 7 -> 9 (allowed),
  - 9 -> 6 (allowed),
  - repeat.
  This cycle contains event8 followed by event3 (so C1 is false) and never contains event1.
- Therefore neither C1 nor ""event1 happens"" holds in all models, so C2 (C1 or event1) is false."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: Event5 is true initially, so C1 requires event6 as well. Event6 can occur (for example 5 -> 9 -> 6), so C1 can be true. But event6 can also be avoided (for example 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> ... cycles without ever choosing 6), so C1 is not guaranteed. Since C1 is not ruled out, the claim ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not entailed — therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning: Initially event5 happens. After event5 one allowed next event is event1. After event1 one allowed next event is event6. Thus both event5 and event6 can occur, so C1 holds and its negation C2 is false.
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event6 happens AND event5 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., it's not the case that both event5 and event6 happen).

Given facts:
- Initially event5 happened, so event5 is true.
- So C1 is equivalent to ""event6 happens"" (since event5 already holds).

Do the rules force event6 to happen? No.
- From event5 you can go to {1,2,3,4,7,9}. Choose 1.
- From event1 you can go to {4,6,7,9}. Choose 4.
- From event4 you can go to {1,8,9}. Choose 1.
Thus the infinite loop 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... is allowed and never produces event6. So there is a valid continuation in which event6 never happens, which makes C1 false in that continuation.

But event6 can also occur in other allowed continuations (e.g., 5 -> 2 -> 6), so C1 is not logically impossible.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed to be true (it is not entailed). So the correct truth-value for C2 under the given context is:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state.

Step 2 — examine the relevant condition(s):
- We are told ""Initially, event5 happened.""
- The rule for after event5 is: ""After event5, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen."" That fixes the next event after the initial event5 to be one of {event1, event4, event6, event7}.

Step 3 — trace to the next state:
- Since the next event after the initial event5 must be 1, 4, 6, or 7, the next state cannot have event5 happen.

Step 4 — conclude:
- Therefore C1 (""Event5 does not happen"") is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one).

Step 2 — examine the context and relevant rule:
- Initially, event5 happened.
- The rule ""After event5, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen"" governs the next state.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- Given the rule, the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event6, event7}.
- None of those is event5, so event5 does not happen in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened, so C1 (""Event5 does not happen"") is false in the initial state.
- We look at the transition rule: ""After event5, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen.""
- That means the immediate next state after the initial state must have one of {event1, event4, event6, event7} — not event5.
- Therefore in the next state, ""Event5 does not happen"" (C1) holds, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- C1 is the statement ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens.""
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event4 happened."" That means event4 is already true (it has happened) in every model of the context, regardless of whether C1 holds or not.
- An implication ""If C1 then event4"" is true whenever the consequent (event4) is already true. Therefore C2 holds given the context.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 states: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens.""
- The context says ""Initially, event4 happened."" That means event4 does happen (already true).
- An implication ""If C1 then event4"" is true whenever the consequent (event4) is true, regardless of whether C1 itself holds.
Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: (event5 → event1).
- C2: (C1 → event4).

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- The context states ""Initially, event4 happened."" So event4 is true in the scenario (it already occurred).

Step 3 — evaluate the implication C2:
- In classical logic an implication ""If P then Q"" is true whenever Q is true, regardless of P.
- Here Q is ""event4 happens"", which is already true. Therefore C2 is true (whether or not C1 holds).

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens.
- The rules state ""After event3, event7 must happen."" So event7 will occur in every execution starting from the given initial condition.
- Therefore C1 (""Event5 happens or event7 happens"") is true (because event7 occurs).
- If the consequent C1 is already true unconditionally, then the implication ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" is also true.

Hence C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened"" and ""After event3, event7 must happen."" So every valid sequence contains event7 (it follows the initial event3).
- C1 is ""event5 happens or event7 happens."" Since event7 always occurs, C1 is true in every sequence.
- If the consequent (C1) is always true, then the implication ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" is automatically true.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens.
- The context says after event3, event7 must happen — so event7 does occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event5 happens or event7 happens"") is true.
- If the consequent of an implication is already true, the implication (""if event4 happens, then C1"") holds regardless of whether event4 happens.

Hence C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event9 happens or event2 happens.""
- The context states initially event2 happened, so C1 is already true at the start.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event9 happens) OR (event2 happens).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point now or in the future C1 is true).

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- Initially, event2 happened.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Because event2 has already happened, C1 is already true at the initial point, so C1 does eventually hold. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event9 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time either event9 or event2 occurs).

Step 2 — check initial facts:
- The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since event2 has occurred, C1 is already true immediately, therefore C1 eventually holds.

Votes: {'False': 1, 'True': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 = (Event5 happens) AND (Event7 does not happen).
- From the context: Initially event5 happened, so ""Event5 happens"" is true.
- But the rule ""After event5, either event1, event4, event7, or event9 must happen"" allows event7 to occur immediately after the initial event5.
- Because event7 is allowed by the rules, we cannot conclude that ""Event7 does not happen"" in all valid event sequences. C1 is therefore not entailed.
- Since C2 requires C1, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Thus C2 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Build the directed graph of allowed next events from each event (duplicates in the context don't change the edges).
- Initial event is 5. From event5 the allowed next events are {1,4,7,9}.
- To satisfy C1 (event7 does not happen), avoid choosing 7. From 5 you can choose 1 (or 4 or 9).
- For example, take 5 -> 1. From 1 the allowed next (excluding 7) are {2,5}. Take 1 -> 2. From 2 you can return to 5 (2 -> 5).
- This gives the cycle 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which avoids event7 entirely and can repeat indefinitely.
- Since event5 occurs initially and there exists a valid sequence that never visits event7, the conjunction ""event5 happens AND event7 does not happen"" (C2) can be true.

Therefore C2 is True.

We want to know whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true. C1 is ""Event8 does not happen."" So C2 means: there is some time after which event8 never occurs (equivalently, event8 occurs only finitely many times).

From the context we have the allowed transitions (summarized):
- 8 -> {1,4,5,6,7,9}
- 1 -> {2,3,5,7}
- 3 -> {4,5,7,8}
- (other transitions exist but are not needed)

Starting initially at event8, we can follow the choices:
8 -> 1 (allowed),
1 -> 3 (allowed),
3 -> 8 (allowed).

That yields the cycle 8,1,3,8 which can be repeated indefinitely. So there is an infinite execution in which event8 occurs infinitely often. Therefore it is not guaranteed that eventually event8 stops occurring, so C2 is false.

Answer: False

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event5 happens. From event5, one of {4, 6, 7} must occur.
- That allows event7 to occur immediately (5 → 7), so C1 (""event7 or event2 happens"") can be satisfied.
- C2 is the negation of C1 (neither event7 nor event2 happens). Because there is a valid sequence in which event7 does occur, C2 is not guaranteed and thus is false.
---

---
False

Reasoning (brief): From the initial event5, event7 is immediately possible, so ""event7 or event2"" (C1) can be true. But C1 is not guaranteed, because you can avoid 2 and 7 by choosing the cycle 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 repeatedly (none of those steps forces 2 or 7). Thus C1 is not universally false, so C2 (the negation of C1) does not follow."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning (stepwise):
- C1 says: event1 does not happen.
- C2 says: if event6 happens, then event1 does not happen (i.e., any sequence with event6 contains no event1).
- From the context we have transitions (relevant ones): 4 -> {3,5,7,9}; 7 -> {2,6,9}; 6 -> {2,3,4,7,9}; 2 -> {4,8}; 8 -> {1,3,4,7,9}; 1 -> {2,3,4,6,7,8,9}.
- A concrete valid sequence starting from the required initial event4 is: 4 -> 7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1.
  - 4 to 7 allowed, 7 to 6 allowed, 6 to 2 allowed, 2 to 8 allowed, 8 to 1 allowed.
- This sequence contains both event6 and event1, so event6 does not imply event1 does not happen.

Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Counterexample from the rules:
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4 we can go to event5.
- From event5 we can go to event1.
- From event1 we can go to event6.

Thus there is a valid sequence (event4 → event5 → event1 → event6) in which event6 happens while event1 also happens, so ""if event6 happens then event1 does not happen"" is false.
---
We look for a valid sequence (starting from event4) in which event6 happens while event1 also happens (any time in that run). If such a sequence exists, C2 (""event6 ⇒ event1 does not happen"") is false.

From the rules:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event5 is allowed.
- After event5, event1 is allowed.
- After event1, event6 is allowed.

Thus the sequence 4 → 5 → 1 → 6 is permitted, so event6 can occur in a run where event1 has occurred. That is a counterexample to C2.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens."" (E2 ∨ E3)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (E2 → (E2 ∨ E3))

Step 2 — logical analysis
- For any proposition A and B, A → (A ∨ B) is a tautology: if A is true then A ∨ B is necessarily true (because A is already true).
- Here A = ""event2 happens"". So if event2 happens, then ""event2 or event3"" is certainly true.

Step 3 — relevance of the context
- The transition rules and initial event are irrelevant to this logical implication: whenever event2 occurs (at any point), C1 is satisfied immediately by the occurrence of event2.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or Event3 happens"" (event2 ∨ event3).
- C2 = ""If Event2 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. event2 → (event2 ∨ event3).

Step 2 — logical analysis:
- In propositional logic, p → (p ∨ q) is a tautology: if p is true then (p ∨ q) is necessarily true (because p already makes the disjunction true).

Step 3 — apply to these events:
- If Event2 happens, then the disjunction ""Event2 or Event3"" is true (since Event2 is true), so C1 holds whenever Event2 happens.

Conclusion:
True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""event2 happens or event3 happens"" (E2 ∨ E3).
- C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (E2 → (E2 ∨ E3)).
- For any proposition p and q, p implies (p ∨ q) is always true: if p is true then p ∨ q is true, and if p is false the implication is vacuously true.
- Therefore E2 → (E2 ∨ E3) is a tautology, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initial event1 occurs.
- From event1 we can choose event3 (allowed: event2, event3, event5, or event6).
- From event3 we can choose event4 (allowed: event4, event7, event8, or event9).
- So both event1 and event4 occur, satisfying C1.
- After event4, event5 must happen; from event5 we may choose event4 again (allowed: event4, event6, or event8).
- By repeating the 4 → 5 → 4 loop, we can keep producing events 4 and 5 and never produce event2.
- Thus there is a valid execution where C1 holds but event2 never happens, so the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1 says: event1 happens and event4 happens.
- C2 says: if C1 holds then event2 happens. We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the given rules.

Step 2 — relevant rules (condensed):
- After event1: one of {2,3,5,6} must happen.
- After event3: one of {4,7,8,9} must happen.
- After event4: event5 must happen.
- After event5: one of {4,6,8} must happen.
(Other rules exist but these are enough.)

Step 3 — produce a concrete allowed sequence that satisfies C1 but never includes event2:
- Start: event1 (given initially).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 choose event4 (allowed). Now both event1 and event4 have occurred → C1 holds.
- From event4 must have event5 (forced).
- From event5 choose event4 (allowed).
- Repeat the 4 → 5 → 4 loop indefinitely.

This entire sequence obeys all ""after"" rules and contains events 1 and 4 but never contains event2.

Conclusion:
- Since there is an allowed execution where C1 holds and event2 does not occur, the implication ""If C1 holds then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds (i.e., event1 and event4 happen), then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — check whether event4 can occur after the initial event1 without ever having event2 occur:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 one allowed next event is event3 (rules allow event2, event3, event5, or event6).
- After event3 one allowed next event is event4 (rules allow event4, event7, event8, or event9).

So the sequence event1 → event3 → event4 is allowed. In that sequence event1 and event4 both occur but event2 never occurs.

Conclusion:
- C1 can hold while event2 does not happen, so the implication in C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- C1 says: whenever event8 happens, event4 happens next.
- Initially event8 happened. The rules for ""after event8"" allow only events {1,2,3,5,6,7} (no event4).
- Therefore the immediate successor of that initial event8 cannot be event4, so C1 is already violated.
- The transition rules are fixed and never give event4 as a successor of event8, so C1 cannot become true later.
- Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is False.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event8 occurs. After event8 one allowed next event is event6.
- After event6 one allowed next event is event8. So there is an infinite cycle 8 → 6 → 8 → 6 … that never visits event4.
- Because such a run exists, ""If event8 happens then event4 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, and it will never become guaranteed later (you can always continue the 8–6 loop and avoid event4).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule for after event2 lists the possible next events: event1, event3, event5, or event8.
- Event9 is not among those options, so event9 cannot happen in the next state.
- C1 (""Event9 happens in the next state"") is therefore false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
True

Reason: Initially event2 occurred, and the rules state that after event2 the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event5, event8}. Event9 is not an option, so ""Event9 happens in the next state"" (C1) cannot hold; therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---

Reasoning: Initially event2 happened. The rule for ""After event2"" allows only events {event1, event3, event5, event8} next. Event9 is not among those, so C1 (""Event9 happens in the next state"") is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Hypothesis C1 says: whenever event5 happens, event3 happens (i.e. after a 5 the next event must be 3).
- From the context: ""After event5, either event3, event4, or event9 must happen."" So after a 5 the next event can be 3 but can also be 4 or 9.
- Counterexample trace from the initial state: event1 → event5 → event4. Here event5 occurred but the following event was 4, not 3, so C1 is already violated.
- C2 asserts that C1 ""eventually holds"" (that at some future point C1 becomes true thereafter). That cannot be guaranteed either, because the transition relation is fixed: whenever a 5 occurs there still exists a possible successor 4 or 9, so one cannot ensure the implication 5 → 3 will hold for all future occurrences.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event3 happens."" (read as: whenever event5 occurs, the next event must be event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there will come a time after which C1 is true/invariant).

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to event5:
- The context explicitly says: ""After event5, either event3, event4, or event9 must happen."" So event5 may be followed by event3, but it may also be followed by event4 or event9.

Step 3 — produce a concrete counterexample run:
- Start (given): event1.
- From event1 choose event5 (allowed: after event1 either event5, event8, or event9).
- From event5 choose event4 (allowed: after event5 either event3, event4, or event9).
This single occurrence (event5 followed by event4) violates C1, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — about C2:
- Because there is an allowed loop event5 → event4 → event5 (after event4 one allowed next is event5), one can keep repeating event5 followed by event4 indefinitely. Thus there is no guarantee that eventually C1 will become true and remain true. So C2 is also false.

Final answer:
False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reason: C1 asserts ""event1 or event6 happens."" From the initial event3, the rules allow event1 to happen next (""After event3, either event1, event2, event4, or event9 must happen""), so C1 can be satisfied. Therefore the negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---

---
True

Reasoning: initially event3 occurs. From event3 one allowed next is event2, and from event2 one allowed next is event3. So we can loop 3 -> 2 -> 3 indefinitely without ever choosing event1 or event6. Thus it is possible that neither event1 nor event6 happens, so ""C1 does not hold"" is true."

Interpretation: C1 means ""event8 never happens"" (globally not 8). C2 means ""eventually C1 holds"" i.e. there is a time after which event8 never occurs (F G ¬8). We must decide whether C2 is forced by the rules from the initial event9.

From the rules we have these transitions (relevant ones):
- 9 -> 5,6,7,8
- 8 -> 1,2,3,4,7
- 1 -> 2,3,4,5,9
- 9 -> 8 (already listed)

Hence there is a cycle that returns to 8: 9 -> 8 -> 1 -> 9 -> 8 -> ... . Starting from the initial event9, we can choose 9->8, then 8->1, then 1->9, then 9->8, and repeat this indefinitely. Thus event8 can occur arbitrarily far into the future (infinitely often).

Therefore it is not guaranteed that there will be a time after which event8 never occurs. C2 is false.

C2 is False.

Reasoning (concise):
- From event3 the rules allow next = event2 or event9.
- To show the implication can fail we need a possible continuation from event3 that never reaches event2.
- Counterexample path: 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 9 and repeat (9 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 9 ...). All those transitions are permitted by the rules and none forces event2. This yields an infinite run starting at event3 that never visits event2.
- Thus event3 does not guarantee that event2 eventually happens, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds.""

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred. Therefore ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (C1 is true).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication (event3 → C1). An implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent. Since C1 is already true, C2 is true.

(Nota bene: there are runs where, after event3, one can loop among events {3,9,1} and avoid a later occurrence of event2; that does not matter here because C1 is satisfied by the initial occurrence of event2.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- The context states ""Initially, event8 happened."" That means event8 has happened (at least at the initial time).
- C2 is the statement ""Event8 happens or C1 holds."" A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true.
- Since event8 has already happened, the disjunction ""Event8 happens or C1"" is true regardless of whether C1 (event7 and event9) holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event7 happens) AND (event9 happens).
- C2 = (event8 happens) OR C1.

Step 2 — use the facts:
- The context states ""Initially, event8 happened."" So event8 is true.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since event8 is true, the disjunction (event8 OR C1) is true regardless of C1.

Final answer: True

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event8 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event8 does not happen next).

Step 2 — examine initial condition and applicable rule:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, either event1, event2, event4, event5, or event6 must happen."" applies.
- Event8 is not among the allowed successors of event3.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Therefore C1 is false (Event8 does not happen in the next state), so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rules for ""after event3"" (repeated several times) list allowed next events as: event1, event2, event4, event5, or event6.
- Event8 is not among those allowed successors of event3, so event8 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event8 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule(s) ""After event3, either event1, event2, event4, event5, or event6 must happen"" appear repeatedly; none allow event8 after event3.
- Therefore event8 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- C2 states that C1 does not hold, so C2 is true."

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 occurred.
- The rules state that after event7 the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- Event1 is not among those options, so C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, which is therefore true.

- The rules state: ""After event7, either event3, event4, or event5 must happen.""
- Therefore the immediate next state after the initial event7 must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state, which contradicts the required next-state options; so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

True

Reasoning: Initially event7 occurs. The rules say that after event7 the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event5}. Event1 is not among those, so ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

First identify the meaning:
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event3 happens."" (read as: whenever a 5 occurs, a 3 will occur afterward).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. C1 becomes true — and stays true — at some point).

Examine the transition graph (condensed from the context):
- 3 → {2,4,6}
- 2 → {3,7}
- 4 → {3,6,8,9}
- 6 → {7,8,9}
- 7 → {1,2,3,6,9}
- 8 → {1,2,5,6,7,9}
- 9 → {1,2,3,4,5}
- 1 → {5,9}
- 5 → {1,2,3,4,7,8,9}

Find a counterexample to C1: from the initial 3 we can reach 5 (for example 3 → 4 → 8 → 5). From 5 we can go to 1, and 1 goes back to 5, so the cycle 5 ↔ 1 is possible. This allows an infinite run that, once it hits 5, stays in {5,1} forever and never visits 3. Thus it is possible for event5 to occur without event3 ever occurring afterward, so C1 is false.

Because the transition rules are fixed, C1 will never “eventually” become true in all futures — the above counterexample run always exists. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Summary of hypotheses
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event3 happens."" (i.e., every time we have event5, the next event must be event3.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point in the future the implication in C1 will hold — but the transition rules are fixed, so this reduces to: C1 is true of the system.)

Is C1 true? No. From the rules, after event5 the possible next events are {1,2,3,4,7,8,9}. Event3 is only one possibility, not the only possibility, so C1 (that 5 always leads to 3) is false. A concrete counterexample run from the initial event3:
- 3 -> 4 (allowed)
- 4 -> 8 (allowed)
- 8 -> 5 (allowed)
- 5 -> 1 (allowed)

Here event5 occurs but the next event is 1, not 3, so C1 fails.

Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false, because C1 is not true of the transition system (and the rules don't change over time).

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: C1 is ""Event9 happens"" (since ""event9 or event9"" is just event9). From the rules, starting at event1 we can have event1 -> event5 (allowed), and then event5 -> event9 (allowed). So event9 can happen, which makes ""event9 does not happen"" (C2) false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is equivalent to ""Event9 happens.""
- From the context, initially event1 happens. After event1 one possible next event is event6.
- After event6 one possible next event is event9.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence (event1 → event6 → event9) in which event9 happens, so C1 can hold.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event9 does not happen). That is contradicted by the possible sequence above, so C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is simply ""Event9 happens"" (it's the same disjunct twice).
- The context says event1 happens initially.
- After event1, event7 is one of the allowed next events.
- After event7, event9 is one of the allowed next events.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence (event1 → event7 → event9) in which event9 happens, so C1 can be true.
- C2 states that C1 does not hold (i.e., event9 does not happen). That is not entailed by the context.

Thus C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says: whenever event7 happens, event5 happens next. C2 says that C1 eventually holds.
- From the rules: after event7, the next event can be one of {event1, event4, event5, event6, event8}. So event5 is only one possible successor, not guaranteed.
- Give a concrete counterexample path from the initial event1:
  - event1 -> event8 (allowed: after event1, event8 may happen),
  - event8 -> event7 (allowed: after event8, event7 may happen),
  - event7 -> event1 (allowed: after event7, event1 may happen).
  Here event7 occurs but the next event is event1, not event5, so C1 is false along this execution.
- Because there is an execution where event7 occurs and is not followed by event5, C1 does not hold, and hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Therefore the final answer is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event4 happens or Event5 happens.""
- Initially Event9 occurred.
- The rules state ""After Event9, Event4 must happen."" (repeated multiple times)
- Therefore Event4 does happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 is true, C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning: C1 asserts ""event4 or event5 happens."" The context states ""Initially, event9 happened"" and also ""After event9, event4 must happen."" Therefore event4 does happen, so C1 holds. C2 is the negation of C1 (that neither event4 nor event5 happens), so C2 is false.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event9 happened.
- The rules state ""After event9, event4 must happen."" Therefore event4 occurs after the initial event9.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., after the initial event, Event1 does not occur in the next state.
- The initial event is event4. The rules state: ""After event4, either event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen."" Event1 is not in that list.
- Therefore, in the next state after event4, event1 cannot occur, so C1 holds in the next state.

Hence C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state, event1 does not occur.

Step 2 — use the initial condition and transition rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules say: after event4, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, event9}. Event1 is not listed.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Therefore event1 cannot occur in the next state, so C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify initial state:
- Initially event4 happened.

Step 2 — look at possible next events after event4:
- The rules say: after event4, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, event9}.

Step 3 — check whether event1 can happen in the next state:
- event1 is not in that set, so event1 cannot happen in the immediate next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

Votes: {'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Interpretation:
- C1 = ""Event8 does not happen"" (i.e., from some point onward, event8 never occurs).
- C2 = ""Eventually C1 holds"" = there is a point after which event8 never happens.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 occurs, and from event4 one allowed next event is event8.
- From event8 one allowed next event is event2.
- From event2 one allowed next event is event8.

Thus there is a cycle: 4 → 8 → 2 → 8 → 2 → ... in which event8 occurs infinitely often. Because such a run is allowed by the rules, it is not guaranteed that we will eventually reach a point after which event8 never happens.

Therefore C2 is False.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- The antecedent ""event3 happens"" is true (initially event3 happened).
- From the rules: after event3, event7 is one of the allowed next events. So event7 can happen.
- C1 asserts ""event7 does not happen""; since event7 is allowed after event3, C1 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore the implication ""If event3 happens, then event7 does not happen"" is not valid (it is false).
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event7 does not happen.
- C2: If event3 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event3 happens then event7 does not happen).

Step 2 — use the premises:
- We are told ""Initially, event3 happened.""
- The rules include: ""After event3, either event1, event5, event6, event7, event8, or event9 must happen."" That explicitly allows event7 to occur immediately after event3.

Step 3 — reason:
- Since event3 does happen (given), and the rules permit event7 to happen next, there is a consistent continuation in which event7 does happen.
- That makes C1 (""event7 does not happen"") false in at least one allowed execution.
- Because the antecedent of C2 (event3 happens) is true and the consequent C1 is false, the implication C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning in brief:
- C2 asserts: if event3 happens then event7 does not happen (C1).
- The context states initially event3 happened and explicitly allows after event3 that event7 may happen (""After event3, either ... event7 ... must happen"" — i.e., event7 is one allowed successor).
- Therefore there is a valid continuation where event3 is followed by event7, so we cannot conclude event7 does not happen.
- Hence the implication in C2 is not guaranteed by the rules, so C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 asserts: ""Event9 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 is the negation: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True (i.e., C1 impossible) or False (C1 is possible).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (condensed)
- Start: event7 happens.
- After 7: one of {2,3,8,9} must happen.
- After 9: one of {2,3,4,6,8} must happen.
- After 2: one of {1,3,4,8} must happen.
- (Other rules exist but these are enough for the needed sequence.)

Step 3 — find a sequence that makes both event9 and event1 happen
- From the initial event7 choose event9 (allowed: 7 -> 9).
- From event9 choose event2 (allowed: 9 -> 2).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed: 2 -> 1).

So the sequence 7 -> 9 -> 2 -> 1 is allowed by the rules, and it makes both event9 and event1 occur. Therefore C1 can hold.

Conclusion
- C1 is possible, so ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not entailed.
Final answer: False
---
C1 asserts both event9 and event1 occur. C2 is the negation (""C1 does not hold"").

From the initial event7 we can follow allowed transitions: 7 -> 9 (allowed), 9 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 1 (allowed). This sequence contains both event9 and event1, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Start: event7 happened.
- From event7 one allowed next event is event9 (7 -> 9).
- From event9 one allowed next event is event2 (9 -> 2).
- From event2 one allowed next event is event1 (2 -> 1).

Thus a valid sequence 7 → 9 → 2 → 1 makes both event9 and event1 occur, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (that C1 does not hold) is false."

Sample responses:
You start at event3. From the rules:
- After event3 you may go to {2,6,7,8}, so you can go 3 → 8 (so event8 happens).
- After event8 you may go to {1,3,5,7}, so take 8 → 1.
- After event1 you may go to {2,3,4,6,9}, so take 1 → 6 (so event6 happens).

Thus the sequence 3 → 8 → 1 → 6 makes both event8 and event6 occur, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
We are given allowed successor events and that event3 happens initially. C1 asserts that event8 happens and event6 happens; C2 is the negation (""C1 does not hold""). We must decide whether C2 is true.

From the rules:
- After event3, event8 is allowed (3 → 8).
- After event8, event1 is allowed (8 → 1).
- After event1, event6 is allowed (1 → 6).

Thus there is a valid sequence starting at the initial event3: 3 → 8 → 1 → 6. In that sequence both event8 and event6 occur, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the allowed next events include event6 and event8 (rule: after event3 → {2,6,7,8}).
- Pick event6 next: sequence 3 → 6.
- From event6 the allowed next events are {2,3} (rule: after event6 → {2,3}), so pick 3: sequence 3 → 6 → 3.
- From that 3 we can pick event8 (again allowed: {2,6,7,8}): sequence 3 → 6 → 3 → 8.
- This sequence contains both event6 and event8, so C1 (event8 happens and event6 happens) can hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event7 always happens (i.e., in every possible future sequence starting from the initial state event5, event7 occurs at some point).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., it is not true that event7 always happens).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (non-exhaustive summary)
- Initial event: event5.
- Relevant successors that avoid event7:
  - event5 -> {1, 9} (none are 7)
  - event1 -> {3, 4, 6, 9} (none are 7)
  - event4 -> {3, 6, 8} (none are 7)
  - event3 -> {4, 6, 7, 9} (has non-7 choices 4,6,9)
  - event6 -> {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8} (has non-7 choices 2,3,4,5,8)
  - event9 -> {4, 6, 7, 8} (has non-7 choices 4,6,8)
  - event2, event8 also have non-7 successors.
Every state that can be reached has at least one successor that is not event7.

Step 3 — find a concrete infinite path that never hits event7
- Start: event5 -> choose event1.
- event1 -> choose event4.
- event4 -> choose event3.
- event3 -> choose event4.
Now repeat the cycle 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> ... forever. None of these steps require choosing event7, so this is a valid infinite sequence starting from event5 that never contains event7.

Conclusion
- Because there exists at least one valid execution (the 4↔3 cycle above) that never visits event7, event7 does not occur in every possible execution. Therefore C1 (""Event7 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event7 always happens."" (i.e. event7 is inevitable / occurs in every valid continuation)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initial event: event5 happened.
- Relevant transitions (condensed):
  - 5 -> {1, 9}
  - 1 -> {3, 4, 6, 9}
  - 3 -> {4, 6, 7, 9}
  - 4 -> {3, 6, 8}
  - 8 -> {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
  - (others exist but not needed)

Step 3 — find a valid sequence that avoids event7
From the initial event5 choose the following allowed moves:
- 5 -> 1 (allowed)
- 1 -> 3 (allowed)
- 3 -> 4 (allowed)
- 4 -> 8 (allowed)
- 8 -> 5 (allowed)

This gives a cycle 5 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 8 → 5 that never uses event7. Because these choices are permitted by the rules, there exists at least one infinite execution that never includes event7.

Conclusion
- C1 is false (event7 is not inevitable).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
C1 states ""Event7 always happens."" C2 is its negation.

Counterexample path avoiding event7: start at event5 (given) → event1 → event3 → event4 → event3 → event4 → ... This 3↔4 loop is allowed by the rules (4 → 3 and 3 → 4 are permitted) and never contains event7. Therefore event7 is not guaranteed to occur, so C1 does not hold.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning: From the initial event6 we can choose event1 (6 -> 1). From event1 we can choose event3 (1 -> 3). From event3 we can choose event4 (3 -> 4). Thus there is a valid sequence (6, 1, 3, 4) in which both event3 and event4 occur, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 states: event3 happens and event4 happens. So C2 is true only if it is impossible, given the rules, for both event3 and event4 to occur.

From the given transitions:
- After event6 → {1,2,9}
- After event1 → {2,3,6,7}
- After event3 → {1,2,4,5,8}
- After event4 → {1,6,7,9}
(and others, but these suffice)

Starting at event6, pick event1 (allowed). From event1, pick event3 (allowed). From event3, pick event4 (allowed). So the sequence 6 → 1 → 3 → 4 is valid under the rules, so both event3 and event4 can happen. Therefore C1 can hold, hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start: event6 happens.
- After event6 we may have event1.
- After event1 we may have event3.
- After event3 we may have event4.

Thus there is a valid sequence 6 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 where both event3 and event4 occur, so C1 can be satisfied. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 one allowed next event is event7 (6 -> 7).
- From event7 one allowed next event is event5 (7 -> 5).
- Thus there is a valid sequence 6 → 7 → 5 in which both event7 and event5 occur, so C1 holds in that sequence.
- C2 states that C1 does not hold; since C1 can and does hold, C2 is false.
---
We start at event6 (given). After event6 one possible next event is event7 (after event6 → {1,2,3,4,7,9}). After event7 one possible next event is event5 (after event7 → {1,3,4,5,6,8}). Thus there is a valid sequence 6 → 7 → 5 that makes both event7 and event5 happen, so C1 holds. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False. 

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether ""C2: C1 does not hold"" is true. C1 says ""event7 happens and event5 happens.""

From the rules:
- Initially event6 happened.
- After event6, event7 is allowed (""After event6 ... event7 ... must happen"" meaning one of the listed events may happen next).
- After event7, event5 is allowed (""After event7 ... event5 ... must happen"" meaning one of the listed events may happen next).

So there is a valid sequence: event6 → event7 → event5. That sequence makes C1 true. Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Counterexample from the rules:
- Initially event8 happened.
- After event8, event3 is allowed.
- After event3, event4 is allowed.
- After event4, event7 is allowed.

So the sequence 8 → 3 → 4 → 7 is permitted, in which event4 happens and event7 also happens. This violates the implication ""if event4 happens, then event7 does not happen,"" so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: Event7 does not happen (i.e., “event7 never occurs”).
- C2: If event4 happens, then C1 holds — equivalently: if event4 occurs, then event7 does not occur.

Step 2 — extract relevant transitions (from the context)
- Initial event: event8.
- after event8 → {event3, event7}
- after event3 → {event4, event9}
- after event4 → {event5, event6, event7, event9}
(Other transitions exist but these are the ones needed.)

Step 3 — trace a concrete allowed sequence showing event4 and event7 can both occur
- Start at event8 (given).
- Choose after event8 → event3 (allowed).
- Then after event3 → event4 (allowed).
- Then after event4 → event7 (allowed).

This yields a valid sequence 8 → 3 → 4 → 7 in which event4 happens and event7 also happens. That contradicts C1 when event4 occurs, so the implication in C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Hypothesis C2 says: if event4 happens then event7 does not happen.
- From the context: initially event8. After event8, event3 is allowed; after event3, event4 is allowed; after event4, event7 is allowed.
- So the sequence 8 → 3 → 4 → 7 is permitted, giving an instance where event4 happens and event7 also happens.
- That counterexample shows the implication is not guaranteed, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event9 happens.
- From event9 one allowed next event is event4 (9 -> 4).
- From event4 one allowed next event is event8 (4 -> 8).
- From event8 one allowed next event is event4 (8 -> 4).
- Repeating 4 -> 8 -> 4 ... yields an infinite run that never returns to event9 (we deliberately avoid the 4->9 and 8->9 choices).

Thus event9 does not necessarily keep occurring in all future steps, so ""Event9 always happens"" (C1) is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event9 happened. After event9 one may choose 8 (allowed: 2,3,4,5,8).
- After event8 one may choose 7 (allowed after 8: 4,7,9).
- After event7 one may choose 1 (allowed after 7: 1,5,6).
- After event1 choose 3 (allowed after 1: 3 or 5).
- After event3 choose 5 (allowed after 3: 2,5,6,7).
- After event5 choose 1 (allowed after 5: 1,4,7).

This gives a cycle 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 that can repeat indefinitely and never includes event9. Therefore event9 is not forced to ""always happen,"" so C1 does not hold and C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event9 happens.
- After event9 we may choose event2 (allowed: after 9 → {2,3,4,5,8}).
- From event2 choose event7 (allowed: after 2 → {4,7}).
- From event7 choose event1 (allowed: after 7 → {1,5,6}).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed: after 1 → {3,5}).
- From event3 choose event5 (allowed: after 3 → {2,5,6,7}).
- From event5 choose event1 (allowed: after 5 → {1,4,7}).

Now we have a closed cycle 1 → 3 → 5 → 1 that avoids event9 entirely. Because there exists a valid continuation after the initial event9 that never hits event9 again, the claim ""Event9 always happens"" (C1) is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event4 happens or event9 happens.""
- The problem states that initially event9 happened, so event9 does happen.
- Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event7 happens."" Since C1 is already true, C2 is true regardless of whether event7 occurs.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event4 happens) OR (event9 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event7 happens).

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- The context states “Initially, event9 happened.” Therefore event9 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- Since event9 happens, C1 is true (event9 satisfies C1).
- If C1 is true, then C2 = C1 OR event7 is also true.

Final answer: True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event9 happened (given).
- C1 is ""event4 happens or event9 happens."" Since event9 has already happened, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event7 happens."" With C1 true, C2 is true regardless of event7."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: Initially event6 occurs. From event6 a next event may be event1. From event1 a next event may be event4. So there is a valid sequence (6 → 1 → 4) in which event1 happens and event4 also happens, contradicting C1. Therefore the implication in C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: Event4 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event4 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the rules / transitions
- From event6 (the initial event) you may go to event1.
- From event1 you may go to event4.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample
- A valid sequence is 6 → 1 → 4. In this sequence event1 happens and event4 also happens.

Conclusion
- Since there exists a valid sequence where event1 occurs and event4 also occurs, the implication ""if event1 happens then event4 does not happen"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event4 does not happen).

Step 2 — check transitions and initial event:
- From event6 (initial), event1 is allowed next (6 -> 1).
- From event1, event4 is allowed next (1 -> 4).

Step 3 — produce a valid sequence that refutes C2:
- Start: event6 (given).
- Then event1 (allowed after 6).
- Then event4 (allowed after 1).

In this valid sequence event1 happens and event4 also happens, so ""if event1 happens then event4 does not happen"" is violated.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (counterexample sequence):
- Initially event9 happens.
- From 9 we can choose event3 (9 -> 3), so the antecedent of C2 (event3 happens) is satisfied.
- From 3 choose event1 (3 -> 1).
- From 1 choose event4 (1 -> 4).
- From 4 choose event7 (4 -> 7).
- From 7 choose event1 again (7 -> 1), then 1 -> 4, 4 -> 7, etc.

This cycle 7 -> 1 -> 4 -> 7 can repeat indefinitely without ever taking the 4 -> 8 option, so event7 can occur without event8 ever occurring. Thus C1 (""if event7 happens, then event8 happens"") is not forced, even after event3 has occurred, so C2 is False.
---

---
C2 is False.

Reasoning and counterexample:
- C1: ""If 7 happens then 8 happens"" (we interpret as: 7 must eventually be followed by 8).
- Start from the given initial event9. After event9 we may choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3 we may choose event2 (allowed).
- After event2 we may choose event7 (allowed).
- After event7 we may choose event2 (allowed) and then back to event7, etc., producing an infinite 7–2 loop that never reaches event8.

Thus there is a valid sequence where event3 occurs, but event7 can happen without event8 ever happening, so C1 does not hold even when event3 has occurred. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis: C2 is the statement ""Event5 happens or C1 holds"" (where C1 is ""Event9 happens and event2 happens"").

Step 2 — inspect given facts: The context begins with ""Initially, event5 happened."" That is an explicit fact: event5 happens.

Step 3 — evaluate C2: A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since event5 happens (given), the disjunction ""event5 happens or C1"" is true regardless of C1.

Conclusion: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (Event9 happens) AND (Event2 happens).
- C2 = (Event5 happens) OR C1.

Step 2 — initial fact:
- The context states ""Initially, event5 happened."" So Event5 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Since Event5 happens, the disjunction (Event5 happens) OR C1 is true regardless of C1.

Final answer: True
---
We are given ""Initially, event5 happened."" C2 is the statement ""Event5 happens or C1 holds"" (where C1 is ""Event9 happens and event2 happens"").

Since event5 is stated to have happened initially, the disjunction in C2 is satisfied regardless of C1. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., every possible sequence starting from the initial event1 must at some point include event9).
- From the given rules: after event1 one allowed next is event3, and after event3 one allowed next is event1. So there is a valid infinite sequence 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... that never includes event9.
- Therefore event9 is not inevitable, so C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
C1 states: ""Event9 always happens.""  
C2 states: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event9 is not inevitable).

From the rules: after event1 you may go to event3, and after event3 you may go to event1. Starting at the initial event1, choose event3, then choose event1, and repeat indefinitely (1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ...). None of these choices require taking a transition to event9, so there is an infinite run that never includes event9. Therefore event9 is not inevitable, C1 is false, and C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- From the rules: 1 -> {2,3,5,6,9} and 3 -> {1,2,4,6,8}.
- Starting at event1, we can choose event3; from event3 we can choose event1 again. That yields an infinite 1 ↔ 3 loop that never visits event9.
- Because there exists a valid path starting from the initial event that never includes event9, event9 is not guaranteed to always happen. Thus C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Start: event9 happens, so event3 must happen next (9 -> 3).
- From event3 we may choose event4 (3 -> 4).
- From event4 event7 must happen (4 -> 7).
- From event7 we may choose event3 (7 -> 3).

This yields the cycle 3 -> 4 -> 7 -> 3 that can repeat indefinitely and never includes event1. Therefore event1 is not guaranteed to always happen, so C1 does not hold. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at every step/state event1 holds)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (the negation of C1)

Step 2 — examine the initial condition
- The system starts with event9 happening (initially event9).

Step 3 — check C1 against the initial condition
- If event1 ""always happens"", then the initial state must be event1.
- But the initial state is event9, not event1, so C1 is already violated.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, so C2 (the statement ""C1 does not hold"") is True.

True
---
Step-by-step:

- Initial event is event9. Rule: after event9, event3 must happen. So sequence begins 9 -> 3.
- From event3, one allowed next is event4 (3 -> 4).
- From event4, event7 must happen (4 -> 7).
- From event7, one allowed next is event2 (7 -> 2).
- From event2, avoid event1 by choosing event8 (2 -> 8).
- From event8, choose event5 (8 -> 5).
- From event5, choose event4 (5 -> 4), returning to event4.

Thus we have a cycle 4 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 5 -> 4 that is reachable from the start (9 -> 3 -> 4) and contains no event1. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, so there exists an execution in which event1 never occurs. Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether ""if event1 happens then (event5 and event6 happen)"" is guaranteed from the given rules starting with event8.

From event8 we can have event1. After event1 one allowed next event is event4. After event4 one allowed next event is event1. Thus there is a legal cycle:

8 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → ...

This infinite/iterated path never requires event5 or event6 to occur. Hence it is possible for event1 to occur without event5 and event6 ever happening. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at initial event8. After event8 we may choose event1.
- After event1 we may choose event4 (rules allow 1 -> 4).
- After event4 we may choose event1 (rules allow 4 -> 1).
- Repeating 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 ... yields a valid infinite trace in which event1 occurs but neither event5 nor event6 ever occurs.
- That is a counterexample to ""If event1 happens, then event5 and event6 happen"", so C2 is false.
---
We ask whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is guaranteed by the rules. C1 requires both event5 and event6 to happen.

From the rules:
- Initially event8 happens, then 8 -> {1,2}.
- From 1 -> {4,5,6}.
- From 4 -> {1,3,5,9}.

There is a valid path that includes event1 but never reaches event5 or event6: 8 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> ... (always choose 4 after 1 and choose 1 after 4). This infinite path contains event1 but never contains event5 or event6, so C1 does not hold on that path.

Because C2 would require that every possible execution that has event1 also has both event5 and event6, and we have a counterexample, C2 is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the statements
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e. event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e. event1 → (event2 ∨ event1)).

Step 2 — Evaluate C2 logically
- The implication event1 → (event2 ∨ event1) is a tautology: if event1 is true, then the disjunction (event2 ∨ event1) is certainly true because event1 is one of its disjuncts. If event1 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
C1 is ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (event2 ∨ event1).
C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (event1 → (event2 ∨ event1)).

But event1 → (event2 ∨ event1) is always true: if event1 is true then event1 ∨ event2 is true (since event1 is included), and if event1 is false the implication is vacuously true. The surrounding sequence rules are irrelevant.

Final answer: True
---
True.

Reasoning: C2 says ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Whenever event1 happens the disjunction ""event2 or event1"" is automatically true (because event1 is true). Thus the implication event1 -> (event2 or event1) is always true, independent of any other conditions."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypotheses:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — use context:
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" Therefore event2 does happen (at the initial moment), so C1 (eventually event2) is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — use the context
- The context begins with ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event2 has already happened, C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true.
- C2 is the disjunction ""event2 happens OR C1 holds."" At least one disjunct (in fact both) is true, so C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 has already occurred, so the eventuality in C1 is satisfied (an event that has happened already counts as ""eventually happens"").

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds."" Since event2 happened initially, the left disjunct is true; also C1 is true. Either way, the disjunction is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event6 happens, then event5 happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds (i.e., event2 ∨ C1).

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event2 happened."" That asserts event2 happens.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Since event2 happened, the disjunction event2 ∨ C1 is true regardless of C1.

Conclusion: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
- The context begins with ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since event2 is true, C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 is the disjunction ""event2 happens OR C1 holds.""
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event2 happened."" Thus event2 is true.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true; since event2 is true, C2 is true regardless of C1."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules: After event9, the next event may be event5, event6, or event8.
- C2 asserts that whenever event9 happens, event8 must happen in the next state. That is stronger than the rule: event8 is only one possible successor of event9, not the only one.
- Counterexample concrete path: Initially event4 (given) → choose event2 (allowed after event4) → choose event9 (allowed after event2) → choose event5 (allowed after event9). Here event9 occurs but the next state is event5, not event8.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed and is False.
---
False

Counterexample (reachable under the given rules):
- Initially event4.
- After event4, event2 may happen.
- After event2, event9 may happen.
- After event9, event5 may happen (the rule after event9 allows 5, 6, or 8).

Thus event9 can occur without event8 happening in the next state, so ""If event9 happens, then event8 happens next"" is not guaranteed.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: ""Event8 happens in the next state.""
- C2 asserts: ""If event9 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., after event9 the next state must be event8.
- The rules state: ""After event9, either event5, event6, or event8 must happen."" That means event5 or event6 are allowed next states as well.
- Therefore event8 is not guaranteed after event9. For example, event9 followed by event5 is a permitted transition that violates C1.

Hence C2 is False."

Sample responses:
We have the directed transitions (unique rules):
- 2 -> {1,4,6,9}
- 9 -> {3,4,5,6,7,8}
- 5 -> {3,4,8}
- (and others, but not needed)

Start is event2. From event2 we can go to event9 (2 -> 9). From event9 we can go to event5 (9 -> 5). So there is a valid sequence 2 -> 9 -> 5 in which event9 happens and event5 also happens afterward.

C2 says ""If event9 happens, then event5 does not happen."" The sequence above is a counterexample, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
C2 asserts: ""If event9 happens, then event5 does not happen.""

Counterexample from the rules: initially event2 happens. After event2 one allowed next event is event9. After event9 one allowed next event is event5. Thus a valid sequence is 2 → 9 → 5, so event5 can occur even when event9 occurs. Therefore the implication is false.

False

False

Counterexample from the rules (starting at event2):
2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 8 -> 9

Here event9 happens but event5 also happened, so ""if event9 then event5 does not happen"" is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (C1 holds or event7 happens) is true given the rules. C1 = ""event8 does not happen"", so C2 = ""(event8 does not happen) OR (event7 happens)"".

We need to check whether every allowed sequence (starting from the initial event5) must satisfy C2. To disprove C2 it is enough to exhibit a valid sequence where event8 does happen and event7 never happens.

Construct a valid sequence from the rules:
- Start: event5 (given).
- From event5 we may choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 we may choose event8 (allowed).
- From event8 we may choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we may choose event4 (allowed).

This gives a cycle: 5 → 4 → 8 → 1 → 4 → 8 → 1 → ... which is entirely consistent with the transition rules, includes event8, and never visits event7. Thus C1 is false in this possible run, and event7 does not occur, so C2 is false (not guaranteed).

Final answer: False
---
We need to check whether in every valid sequence starting with event5, ""event8 does not happen OR event7 happens"" must hold. To falsify C2, we need a valid sequence where event8 does happen and event7 never happens.

From the rules:
- From event5 you can go to event4.
- From event4 you can go to event8.
- From event8 you can go to event1 (avoiding 7).
- From event1 you can go back to event4.

So one valid infinite sequence is: 5 → 4 → 8 → 1 → 4 → 8 → 1 → ... This sequence contains event8 and never contains event7. Thus C1 is false (event8 does occur) and event7 does not occur, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
C1 is ""Event8 does not happen."" C2 is ""C1 holds or event7 happens"" i.e. (not event8) OR event7.

We can exhibit a valid sequence of events (following the given rules) where event8 does occur and event7 never occurs, so both disjuncts of C2 are false.

Start at the initial event5, then choose:
5 -> 4 (allowed: after 5 either 4 or 9)
4 -> 8 (allowed: after 4 can be 8)
8 -> 1 (allowed: after 8 can be 1)
1 -> 4 (allowed: after 1 can be 4)

This yields the cycle 4 -> 8 -> 1 -> 4 ... which is consistent with the rules, contains event8, and never includes event7. Hence C1 is false and event7 does not happen, so C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 occurred. The rule for after event6 says the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event5, event8}. So event1 cannot be the next event. Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false in all reachable next states.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. So C2 is true.
- (Note: independent of vacuity, if event1 did occur then the rules allow {event4, event6, event7} next, so event4 would be only one possible outcome, not guaranteed. But that possibility is moot here because C1 cannot occur after event6.)
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- The rules say: after event1, either event4, event6, or event7 must happen. So event4 is only one possible outcome, not guaranteed.
- Provide a concrete counterexample trace starting from event1 that never forces event4:
  1. event1 occurs (C1 true).
  2. choose event6 (allowed after event1).
  3. after event6 choose event2 (allowed).
  4. after event2 choose event3 (allowed).
  5. after event3 choose event9 (allowed).
  6. after event9 choose event6 (allowed).
  Repeat steps 2–6 to loop indefinitely without ever having event4.

Thus C1 does not imply event4; C2 is False.
---
You ask whether ""If event1 happens in the next state, then event4 happens"" is guaranteed by the given rules.

From the rules: after event1 the next event may be 4, 6, or 7. That means event4 is one possible successor but not the only one. A counterexample: if event1 occurs and the system chooses event6 next, event4 does not happen. Therefore the implication is not guaranteed.

Reasoning in brief:
- C1 says: whenever event1 happens, event2 happens (i.e., the successor of event1 must be event2).
- The context explicitly states that after event1 the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event5, event6, event7} — event2 is not allowed after event1. So C1 is false.
- The transition rules are fixed, so C1 cannot become true later; therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 says ""Event9 always happens."" So C2 claims that once event2 has occurred, event9 is inevitable.

- From the context rules:
  - Initially event7 happens.
  - After event7, event2 is allowed.
  - After event2, event1 is allowed.
  - After event1, event2 is allowed.
  (All these transitions are explicitly permitted by the given rules.)

- Therefore there is a valid infinite sequence that avoids event9:
  7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... 
  This sequence is allowed by the rules and contains no event9.

- Because event2 can occur (indeed it can immediately after the initial 7) and it is still possible to avoid event9 forever, C1 is not forced by occurrence of event2. Hence C2 is false.
---
Summary of the hypothesis
- C1: Event9 always happens (i.e., in every possible future/event sequence event9 occurs).
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. Equivalently: whenever event2 occurs, event9 is guaranteed to always happen.

Check the transition rules (condensed)
- start at 7.
- 7 -> {2, 8}
- 2 -> {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- 1 -> {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- 3 -> {1, 4, 6}
- 4 -> {3}
- 5 -> {2, 3, 6, 8}
- 6 -> {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- 8 -> {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- 9 -> {1, 3, 8}

Counterexample showing C2 is false
- From initial 7 take 7 -> 2 (allowed).
- From 2 take 2 -> 1 (allowed).
- From 1 take 1 -> 2 (allowed).
This yields the infinite loop 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... which never visits event9. Thus event2 can occur while event9 never happens, so C1 does not hold in that run. Therefore the implication ""if event2 happens then C1 holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules we have these transitions (relevant ones): 7 -> {2,8}; 2 -> {1,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 4 -> {3}; 3 -> {1,4,6}; 1 -> {2,3,5,7,9}.
- Starting from initial event7 we can pick event2. From event2 we can go to event4 (allowed). From event4 we must go to event3. From event3 we can go to event1. From event1 we can go back to event2.
- This yields the cycle 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2, which never visits event9 and can repeat indefinitely.
- Therefore, event9 is not guaranteed to always happen after event2, so C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 says: if event8 eventually happens (C1), then event7 will happen (later).
- From the rules: after event8 one possible next event is event4 (8 -> 4). After event4 the only next event is event3 (4 -> 3). After event3 one possible next event is event4 (3 -> 4). Thus there is a cycle 4 -> 3 -> 4 that can be followed indefinitely.
- Starting from the initial event7, choose 7 -> 8 (allowed), then 8 -> 4, then 4 -> 3, then repeatedly 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> ... . This path contains event8 but never returns to event7.
- Therefore C1 can hold while event7 never happens afterwards, so ""If C1 then event7"" is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False.
---

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C2 says: ""If C1 holds (event8 eventually happens), then event7 happens.""
- The problem statement starts with ""Initially, event7 happened."" That means event7 has already occurred in every possible trace.
- Therefore, regardless of whether event8 ever occurs later, event7 is already true. So the implication ""if event8 eventually happens then event7 happens"" is satisfied.
- (If the intended reading were stronger — e.g., ""if event8 happens then event7 happens afterwards"" — that would be a different claim. Under that stronger reading the claim is not guaranteed, because from event8 one can move to 2 and then loop 1↔2 forever, avoiding a later occurrence of 7. But the plain reading of C2 as stated is true.)

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis is asking
- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event7 happens or C1 holds"" i.e. (Event7 happens) OR (Event6 does not happen).
C2 is false exactly when Event6 does happen and Event7 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (deduplicated)
- 1 -> {6,9}
- 2 -> {3,4,5,9}
- 3 -> {2,5,7,8}
- 4 -> {1,2,3,6}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,4}
- 6 -> {2,3,8,9}
- 7 -> {2,4,9}
- 8 -> {3,4,5}
- 9 -> {1,3,4,5,7}

Step 3 — produce a counterexample path (shows C2 can be false)
Start at the given initial event2 and follow allowed choices that include event6 but avoid event7:
2 -> 4 (allowed),
4 -> 6 (allowed) — now event6 has occurred,
6 -> 8 (allowed),
8 -> 5 (allowed),
5 -> 1 (allowed),
1 -> 6 (allowed),
and then repeat the cycle 6->8->5->1->6...
This infinite path contains event6 (so C1 is false) and never visits event7 (so ""Event7 happens"" is false).

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event6 occurs and event7 never occurs, C2 is not guaranteed and therefore is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 is ""Event7 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event6 does not happen"".
- So C2 is false exactly when Event6 does happen and Event7 never happens.
- From the rules: after event2 one can choose event4; after event4 one can choose event6; after event6 one can choose event2. Thus a valid sequence is:
  event2 → event4 → event6 → event2 → event4 → event6 → ...
- In this sequence event6 occurs and event7 never occurs, so C1 is false and Event7 does not happen, making C2 false.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2 happened.
- From event2 we may choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 we may choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 we may choose event2 (allowed).
- Repeat the cycle 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> ... indefinitely.

This run contains event6 (so C1 ""event6 does not happen"" is false) and never contains event7. Therefore ""event7 happens or C1 holds"" is false in this valid sequence. Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From event1 the allowed next events include event2.
- From event2 one allowed next event is event3.
- From event3 one allowed next event is event1.
- Thus there is a cycle 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 that can be repeated indefinitely.
- That cycle never visits event6, so it is possible for event1 to occur without event6 ever happening.
- Therefore the statement ""If event1 happens, then event6 happens"" (C1) does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens.
- From the rules: after event1 one allowed next event is event4; after event4 one allowed next event is event1.
- Therefore there is a valid infinite sequence 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... that never includes event6.
- Since it's possible for event1 to occur without event6 ever happening, the statement C1 (""If event1 happens, then event6 happens"") does not hold. Hence C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event6 happens (i.e., every run starting from event1 must eventually include event6).
- C2: C1 does not hold.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules relevant to event1:
- After event1 the allowed next events are {2,4,5,8,9}.
- After event4 the allowed next events are {1,2,3}.

Step 3 — exhibit a valid behavior that disproves C1:
- From the initial event1 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 … indefinitely. This infinite valid run contains event1 but never contains event6.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (we found a valid run starting at event1 that never reaches event6), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Sample responses:
First identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at every step/event in the execution).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., C1 is false).

From the context: the initial event is event7. After event7 one allowed next event is event2 (the rules list: after event7, either event1, event2, event4, or event6 must happen). So there is a valid execution that starts event7 → event2. At that point event1 did not occur, so it is not true that event1 occurs at every step. Therefore C1 is false, so C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning: From the initial event7 we can follow only allowed successors and avoid event1 forever. For example:

7 -> 2 (allowed),  
2 -> 4 (allowed),  
4 -> 8 (allowed),  
8 -> 3 (allowed),  
3 -> 5 (allowed),  
5 -> 4 (allowed),

and then repeat the cycle 4 -> 8 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 ... indefinitely. None of these events is event1, so event1 need not occur. Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning: C1 claims ""Event1 always happens."" But the context states that initially event7 happened, so at that time event1 did not happen. Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

We want to decide whether C2 (""If event9 happens, then C1 holds"") is true. C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event6 happens.""

Interpretation: C2 asserts that whenever event9 occurs, it becomes true that every occurrence of event3 implies event6 (i.e., after any 3 that happens, 6 must occur). To refute C2 it suffices to give a valid sequence (consistent with the ""after X"" rules) in which 9 occurs and later a 3 occurs that is not followed by 6.

Construct a counterexample sequence starting from the given initial event1:
- Start: event1 (given).
- After 1 we may go to 5 (1 -> 5 is allowed).
- After 5 we may go to 9 (5 -> 9 is allowed). So event9 has happened.
- After 9 we may go to 2 (9 -> 2 is allowed).
- After 2 we may go to 3 (2 -> 3 is allowed). So event3 has happened after event9.
- After 3 the allowed next events are only 5 or 7 (3 -> 5 or 3 -> 7); 6 is not an allowed successor of 3. Thus event3 does not force event6 here.

This concrete valid path shows event9 can occur while C1 is false (a 3 occurs that is not followed by 6). Therefore C2 is false.

False

Reason: C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false because there is a valid infinite loop avoiding event2, e.g. 9 → 4 → 1 → 9 → 4 → … never visits event2. That already makes C1 false.

C2 asserts ""if event7 happens, then C1 holds."" But event7 is reachable (e.g. 9 → 4 → 7), and from 7 you can go to 4 and then follow the same 4 → 1 → 9 → 4 … loop to avoid event2 forever. Thus event7 can occur while event2 does not necessarily happen, so the implication is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""If event4 happens, then event8 eventually happens"") is true given the transition rules and initial event5.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Extract the transition graph (edges ""X -> Y"" mean Y may follow X):
- 1 -> {2,5,8,9}
- 2 -> {3,4,6,9}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,5,8,9}
- 4 -> {1,3,6,8,9}
- 5 -> {1,2,6,7,8}  (initially at 5)
- 6 -> {1,3,4,5,7,8}
- 7 -> {2,6,9}
- 8 -> {1,3,7}
- 9 -> {3,5,7,8}

2. To make C2 false we need a possible execution (starting from the initial event5) in which event4 occurs and afterwards event8 never occurs. If such an execution exists, the implication is not guaranteed.

3. Construct a counterexample path:
- From the initial 5: 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (so event4 does occur).
- From 4 we can follow the cycle 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 repeatedly.
  Each step in that cycle is an allowed transition, and none of the nodes 4,1,2,3 is event8.
- Therefore one can remain in this cycle forever after reaching 4, avoiding event8 indefinitely.

Because an execution starting at the given initial state reaches event4 and then can avoid event8 forever, the implication ""if event4 happens, then event8 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Start at event5. One possible path: 5 -> 2 -> 4 (since 5→2 and 2→4 are allowed).
- After 4, there is an allowed transition 4 -> 6, and from 6 there's an allowed transition 6 -> 4. So you can loop 4 ↔ 6 forever.
- That infinite loop never uses any transition to event8, so event8 need not eventually occur after event4.

Therefore the implication ""If event4 happens, then event8 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed; C2 is False.
---
We ask whether ""If event4 happens, then event8 eventually happens"" is guaranteed (i.e., from event4 every possible future sequence must reach event8).

From the conditions we extract the transitions (edges):
- 1 -> {2,5,8,9}
- 2 -> {3,4,6,9}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,5,8,9}
- 4 -> {1,3,6,8,9}
- 5 -> {1,2,6,7,8}
- 6 -> {1,3,4,5,7,8}
- 7 -> {2,6,9}
- 8 -> {1,3,7}
- 9 -> {3,5,7,8}

From event4 there is a cycle that avoids event8: 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4. Each step is allowed, and this cycle can be repeated indefinitely without ever choosing event8. Thus it is possible for event4 to occur and yet event8 never happens.

Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:

---
True.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 says ""Event9 does not happen.""
- But the context explicitly states ""Initially, event9 happened."" So C1 contradicts the given facts and therefore cannot hold.
- A conditional ""If C1 then event6"" is vacuously true whenever the antecedent (C1) is impossible/false.
- Therefore C2 (""If C1 holds, then event6 happens"") is true.
---
True

Reasoning (concise):
- The premise set includes ""Initially, event9 happened.""
- C1 asserts ""event9 does not happen,"" which contradicts the given initial fact; there is no model/trace of the system where C1 holds.
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true: if there is no possible situation in which C1 holds, then ""if C1 holds then event6 happens"" is true in all models.
- Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initial event is event8.
- After event8, event1 or event5 (among others) may occur.
- If event1 occurs next, after event1 event5 is allowed.
- So there is a valid sequence: event8 → event1 → event5, in which both event1 and event5 happen.
- Therefore C1 (event1 and event5 happen) can be true, so C2 (C1 does not hold) is not true.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event8 happened.
- After event8, one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event9} must happen. Choose event1.
- After event1, one of {event5, event6, event7, event9} must happen. Choose event5.
- Thus a valid sequence is: event8 → event1 → event5, so both event1 and event5 can occur.

Since C1 (event1 and event5 happen) can hold, C2 (C1 does not hold) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 happens.
- After event8, event1 is allowed. So take event8 -> event1.
- After event1, event5 is allowed. So take event1 -> event5.
- Thus there is a valid sequence where both event1 and event5 happen, so C1 can be true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to check whether ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" is valid, where C1 = ""Event4 always happens.""

Interpret C1 as: event4 will necessarily occur (i.e., there is no possible future in which event4 never occurs). We show a counterexample path where 7 occurs but 4 never occurs.

Relevant transitions (deduplicated):
- start: event1 happened.
- after 1: {4,5,7,8,9}
- after 5: {1,2,8}
- after 7: {3,5,9}
- (other transitions exist but not needed)

Construct a legal cycle that contains 7 but never hits 4:
1 -> 7 (allowed),
7 -> 5 (allowed),
5 -> 1 (allowed),
1 -> 7 (allowed),
and repeat.

This infinite loop (1,7,5,1,7,5,...) contains event7 but never contains event4, so event4 is not guaranteed to occur when 7 happens. Therefore C2 is False.

False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):
- From event7 the possible next events are {3,5,9}.
- From event3 the possible next events include 7 (3 -> 7).
- Thus there is a cycle 7 -> 3 -> 7 that avoids event4.
- Since after event7 you can loop 7↔3 indefinitely without ever reaching event4, event4 is not guaranteed to always happen when event7 occurs.
Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules, after event1 one possible next event is event7.
- After event7 one possible next event is event3.
- After event3 one possible next event is event7.
- Thus starting from the initial event1 we can follow the infinite loop 1 → 7 → 3 → 7 → 3 → ... and never take a transition to event4.
- Therefore event4 is not guaranteed to always happen even when event7 occurs, so ""If event7 happens, then C1 (event4 always happens)"" is false."

Reason: Start at event8 and always pick the transition 8 -> 7 and then 7 -> 8. This yields the infinite trace 8,7,8,7,... which never visits event3. Thus C1 (""event3 does not happen"") holds from the start on that trace, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the premises, after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen. So there is an allowed trace 1 → 3, which makes C1 (event3 or event9) true. Therefore C1 is not ruled out, so its negation C2 cannot be concluded as true.
- (For completeness: there also exists a trace avoiding 3 and 9 forever, e.g. 1 → 2 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 6 → …, so C2 is satisfiable but not entailed. The question asks whether C2 holds from the premises — it does not.)
---
False

Reasoning: From event1 you can choose event2 (to avoid event3). From event2 choose event6 (to avoid event9). From event6 choose event1 (allowed). That yields the cycle 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> ... which can repeat indefinitely without ever producing event3 or event9. So C1 (that event3 or event9 happens) is not forced by the rules, and therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed — it is not entailed as true.
---
False

Reasoning in brief:
- From the initial event1, the rules permit event3 to happen immediately (after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen). If event3 happens then C1 (""event3 or event9 happens"") is true, so C2 (the negation of C1) is false.
- Because there exists at least one allowed evolution where C1 holds, C2 is not entailed by the rules. (Even though there also exist evolutions that avoid 3 and 9, that only shows C1 is not inevitable; it does not make C2 universally true.)"

Votes: {'True': 1, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — check C1 (Event2 always happens).
- From the rules: after event1, event4 is allowed; after event4, event1 is allowed. So there is a valid infinite sequence 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → … that never includes event2.
- Therefore event2 is not inevitable; C1 is false.

Step 2 — evaluate C2 (""If C1 holds, then event6 happens"").
- C2 is a material implication with antecedent C1. Since C1 is false (there are no runs where event2 always happens), the implication ""if C1 then event6"" is vacuously true — there is no counterexample run in which C1 holds but event6 does not.
- Thus C2 is True.

Answer: True
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 states that event2 occurs (in particular it can occur repeatedly). C2 claims that if C1 holds then event6 must occur.
- From the rules we have these allowed successor sets (relevant ones listed):
  - 1 -> {4,6,7,8}
  - 3 -> {1,2,5,6,7}
  - 4 -> {1,3,5,7,8,9}
  - 2 -> {3,5,6,7,8}
  - (and others, but these suffice)
- Starting from the initial event1, one possible infinite path is:
  1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> ...
  Every listed transition is allowed, this cycle visits event2 repeatedly but never visits event6.
- Thus it is possible for C1 to hold (event2 occurs repeatedly) while event6 never happens. That is a counterexample to the implication, so C2 is false.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. from some point onward, event3 never occurs (there exists a suffix of the execution with no event3).

Step 2 — transitions (condensed)
- 6 -> {1,3,4,5,7,8}
- 1 -> {4,5,9}
- 4 -> {3,7,8}
- 8 -> {3,4,9}
- 9 -> {1,3,5,6,7,8}
- 7 -> {2}
- 2 -> {1,3,4,6,8}
- 5 -> {1,4,7,9}
- 3 -> {1,5,6,7,9}

Step 3 — find a suffix with no event3
Starting at the initial event6, follow this cycle which contains no event3:
6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 9 -> 6 ...
Each step is allowed by the rules above and none of these nodes is 3. Repeating that cycle forever yields an execution in which event3 never occurs (so C1 holds immediately and therefore eventually).

Conclusion
- C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True.

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""event6 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e., p ∨ q with p = 'event6 happens').
- C2 is ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., p → (p ∨ q)).
- For any proposition p and q, p → (p ∨ q) is a tautology: whenever p is true, p ∨ q is necessarily true.
- The given event-transition context is irrelevant to this logical form; whenever event6 occurs, C1 is automatically satisfied.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
C2 states: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event6 happens or event2 happens."" So C2 is the implication: event6 → (event6 ∨ event2).

An implication p → (p ∨ q) is always true: if event6 is true, then the disjunction (event6 ∨ event2) is true because event6 is true; if event6 is false, the implication is true by default. Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event6 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e., event6 ∨ event2).
- C2: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., event6 ⇒ (event6 ∨ event2)).

Step 2 — logical analysis
An implication A ⇒ (A ∨ B) is always true: if A is true, then A ∨ B is certainly true. Here A is ""event6 happens"", B is ""event2 happens"". So whenever event6 happens, event6 ∨ event2 is true immediately.

The given event rules and initial event8 are irrelevant to this tautology — C2 is true purely by logical form.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning: C2 says ""(event9 or event5) implies event9"", i.e. whenever event5 occurs then event9 must also occur. But starting from the initial event1 we can choose a sequence that contains event5 and never contains event9: for example
1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 ... 
This cycle (3↔2) avoids event9 indefinitely. Thus C1 can hold (because event5 happened) without event9 ever happening, so the implication is not guaranteed. Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- From event1 you can choose event5 (rule: after event1 → {3,4,5}).
- From event5 you can choose event7 (after event5 → {3,6,7,8}).
- From event7 you can choose event5 (after event7 → {1,4,5,6}).
- Thus you can have the infinite cycle 1 → 5 → 7 → 5 → 7 … in which event5 occurs but event9 never occurs.

This provides a counterexample where C1 (event9 or event5) is true (because event5 happens) while event9 does not happen, so the implication C1 ⇒ event9 (C2) is false.
---
False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Start at event1 (given). Choose event5 next (allowed: after event1 either 3, 4, or 5).
- From event5 you may choose event7 (allowed: after 5 either 3, 6, 7, or 8).
- From event7 you may choose event5 (allowed: after 7 either 1, 4, 5, or 6).

Thus there is a valid infinite trace 1 → 5 → 7 → 5 → 7 → … in which event5 happens but event9 never happens. That makes C1 true (because event5 happens) while event9 is false, so the implication (C1 ⇒ event9) is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- From the rules: 1 -> {2,5,6,7}, 2 -> {1,5,7,8}, 8 -> {1,4,5,6,7}, etc.
- Starting at the initial event1 we can follow 1 -> 2 -> 8. After event8 we can choose 1 (since 8 -> 1 is allowed) and then 2 (2 -> 1 is allowed), and repeat 1 ↔ 2 forever. This infinite path contains event8 but never contains event4.
- Thus ""if event8 happens, then event4 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, so C1 is false. Therefore the conjunction C1 and event9 (C2) is false as well.
---
Plan: determine whether (1) C1 (""if event8 happens then event4 happens"") is entailed by the rules, and (2) event9 must happen. If either fails, C2 (C1 holds and event9 happens) is false.

1) From the rules, after event8 the possible next events are {1,4,5,6,7}. So event4 is possible but not forced. To refute C1 it suffices to exhibit a valid run where event8 occurs but event4 never occurs. Starting from the given initial event1, pick transitions:
- 1 -> 2 (allowed),
- 2 -> 8 (allowed),
- 8 -> 1 (allowed).

This gives a cycle 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1 that never visits event4. Thus event8 can occur while event4 does not happen afterward, so ""if event8 happens then event4 happens"" is not guaranteed. C1 is false.

2) Event9 need not happen either. The same cycle 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1 can repeat forever and avoids event9, so event9 is not guaranteed from the initial state.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds and event9 happens"") is false.

False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""If event8 happens, then event4 happens."" (i.e., event4 must follow whenever event8 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event9 happens."" We must check if both parts are entailed by the given rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- From event8 the possible next events are {event1, event4, event5, event6, event7}. Event4 is only one option, not the only option.
- From event1 the possible next events are {event2, event5, event6, event7}.
- From event2 the possible next events are {event1, event5, event7, event8}.
- From event9 the possible next events are {event2, event3, event4, event7}.
- Many rules repeat; the system is nondeterministic (one of the listed events must happen next).

Step 3 — counterexample showing C1 can fail
- Suppose event8 happens, then choose event1 next (allowed).
- From event1 choose event2 next (allowed).
- From event2 choose event1 next (allowed).
- Repeat 1 → 2 → 1 indefinitely. This trace contains event8 but never contains event4. Thus the implication ""if event8 happens, then event4 happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules.

Step 4 — event9 is not guaranteed either
- The same looping trace (1 ↔ 2) avoids event9 forever, so event9 is not forced by the rules starting from the initial event1.

Conclusion
- C1 is not entailed by the context, and event9 is also not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 is ""Event9 does not happen.""

From the rules: ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen."" The initial event is event1. Therefore there is a valid continuation in which event9 happens immediately (event1 -> event9). That shows C1 (event9 does not happen) can be violated, so C1 is not always true. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event9 does not happen.""  
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" So C2 claims that in every allowable sequence of events, event9 never occurs.

Step 2 — inspect the rules and initial condition
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7, event9} must happen.

Step 3 — find a counterexample
- From the initial event1 we are allowed to choose event9 next (it is explicitly listed).
- So the sequence event1 → event9 is permitted by the rules. That sequence contains event9, so C1 (""Event9 does not happen"") is false in that sequence.

Conclusion
- Because there exists an allowed sequence where event9 happens, C1 does not always hold; therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event9 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., event9 never happens in any possible sequence).

Step 2 — Examine the rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules state: ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen.""

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- From the initial event1, event9 is an allowed next event. Therefore there exists a valid sequence in which event9 happens.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- Because there is a possible sequence where event9 occurs, C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We interpret C2 (""C1 always holds"") as: in every possible future (from the given initial condition) C1 is true. C1 is the conjunction ""event5 happens and event7 happens.""

1. From the context, event7 has already happened initially, so the event7 part of C1 is satisfied at the start.
2. For C1 to always hold, event5 must therefore be inevitable (must occur on every possible path).
3. From event7 the allowed next events include event1 (7 -> 1). From event1 the allowed next events include event7 (1 -> 7). So there is a valid infinite path 7 -> 1 -> 7 -> 1 -> ... that never includes event5.
4. This path is consistent with the rules but avoids event5, so C1 does not hold on that path.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happens, so the ""event7 happens"" part of C1 is satisfied immediately.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds, i.e., in every possible sequence starting from event7, event5 must also occur at some point.
- But from event7 one allowed next event is event1, and from event1 one allowed next event is event7. Thus the sequence 7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → ... is an allowed infinite trace.
- That trace never contains event5, so there exists a valid sequence starting from the initial event7 in which event5 never happens.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in all possible runs, so C2 is False.
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Initial event7 has happened (given).
- C1 requires event5 happens and event7 happens. Since event7 already happened initially, C1 reduces to: event5 must happen at some point.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds — i.e., in every possible sequence starting from the initial event7, event5 will occur.

Find a counterexample sequence avoiding event5:
- Start at 7. Choose 1 (allowed: after 7, one may pick 1,3,5,6,9).
- From 1 choose 6 (allowed: after 1, pick 3,4,6,7,8).
- From 6 choose 3 (allowed: after 6, pick 3,5,7,8,9).
- From 3 choose 9 (allowed: after 3, pick 5,8,9).
- From 9 choose 2 (allowed: after 9, pick 2 or 4).
- From 2 choose 7 (allowed: after 2, pick 3,4,7).

This returns to 7 without ever producing event5, so we can repeat the cycle 7 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 9 -> 2 -> 7 indefinitely. Thus there exists a valid sequence in which event5 never occurs. Therefore C1 does not hold in all possible runs.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""Event9 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"") is true given the rules and initial event3. That means: does every allowed sequence starting from event3 necessarily include event9 and also eventually include event1?

Key rules (unique ones extracted):
- start: event3.
- after 3 → {2, 8}
- after 2 → {6, 7}
- after 6 → {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- after 7 → {1, 4, 6, 9}
- after 1 → {6, 7, 8}
- after 4 → {1, 5, 9}
- after 9 → {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- after 8 → {2, 5, 6, 7}
- after 5 → {1, 8}

Counterexample (an infinite run that avoids both event1 and event9):
- From 3 choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2 choose 6 (allowed).
- From 6 choose 3 (allowed).
This yields the cycle 3 → 2 → 6 → 3 → ... which can repeat forever and never visits event1 or event9.

Because such a valid sequence exists that does not contain event9 and never reaches event1, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
C2 asserts: ""Event9 happens and (C1) Event1 eventually happens.""

From event3 we can choose the transitions 3 -> 8, 8 -> 6, 6 -> 3 and repeat this indefinitely (each choice is allowed by the rules). This infinite cycle 3 -> 8 -> 6 -> 3 ... never produces event9 or event1, so there is a valid execution starting from the initial event3 in which C2 does not hold. Therefore C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
The hypothesis C2 asserts ""Event9 happens and C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

From the context we have the transition rules (condensed):
- After 3 → 2 or 8
- After 2 → 6 or 7
- After 6 → 1, 2, 3, 7, or 8
- (others exist but are not needed)

Starting at the initial event3, there is a valid infinite trace that avoids both event1 and event9:
3 → 2 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 6 → 3 → ...
- 3→2 is allowed (after 3 choose 2)
- 2→6 is allowed (after 2 choose 6)
- 6→3 is allowed (after 6 choose 3)

This cycle never produces event1 or event9, so event1 need not eventually happen and event9 need not happen. Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens.
- From event1 one allowed next event is event2.
- From event2 one allowed next event is event1.
- Hence there is an allowed infinite sequence 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... that never visits event9.
- Therefore ""Event9 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed (is false), so its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning: Starting from the initial event1, choose event2 (allowed), then from event2 choose event1 (allowed), and repeat. The infinite sequence 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... is permitted by the rules and never contains event9. Thus event9 does not necessarily eventually happen, so ""C1: Event9 eventually happens"" does not hold, making C2 true.
---
You ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 says ""Event9 eventually happens."" So C2 is the negation: ""Event9 does not eventually happen.""

From the rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From 1 you may go to 2 (1 -> 2).
- From 2 you may go to 1 (2 -> 1).

Thus there is an infinite execution 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that never visits event9. Therefore event9 is not guaranteed to eventually occur, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts ""event8 happens"" (it's redundant but simply requires event8 to occur).
- C2 says C1 always holds — i.e., in every possible future sequence starting from the initial conditions, event8 must occur.
- From the context, the initial event is event3, and event3 can be followed by event1 (since after event3, event1 is allowed), and event1 can be followed by event3 (since after event1, event3 is allowed).
- That gives an infinite loop 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... which never includes event8.
- Because there exists at least one valid sequence that never reaches event8, event8 is not guaranteed to always happen.

Therefore C2 (C1 always holds) is False.
---
False

Reason: C1 just asserts ""event8 happens."" From the initial event3 we can choose the transition 3 -> 1, then 1 -> 3, and repeat 3 -> 1 -> 3 indefinitely. This infinite run never visits event8, so event8 is not guaranteed in all runs. Therefore ""C1 always holds"" is false.

C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""event8 happens"" (it's just repeated).
- C2 says C1 always holds — i.e., in every possible sequence from the initial condition, event8 must occur.
- Initially event3 happens. From event3 you may choose event1; from event1 you may choose event3. Thus there is a valid infinite sequence 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... that never includes event8.
- Because there exists at least one possible path that avoids event8 indefinitely, event8 is not guaranteed to always occur.

Therefore C2 is False."

False

Reasoning summary:
- From the initial state event5, the next event can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.
- C2 requires that ""event4 eventually happens"" holds in the next state for all possible next choices.
- Counterexample: if the next event is 2, choose the subsequent events 3 then 2 then 3 ... infinitely. The transitions 2 -> 3 and 3 -> 2 are allowed, producing an infinite loop that never visits event4.
- Therefore there is a next state (event2) from which event4 does not eventually happen, so C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""In the next state, C1 holds"" — i.e. from whatever event occurs immediately after the initial state, event4 will eventually occur on every continuation.

From the context, the allowed immediate successors are:
- After event5 (the initial event) the next event must be one of {2,4,6,8}.

To falsify C2 it suffices to find one possible next-event choice and one continuation from it that never reaches event4.
- If the next event is 2, we can choose the following infinite path that avoids event4:
  2 -> 3 -> 9 -> 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 1 -> ...
  All those transitions are allowed (2→3, 3→9, 9→1, 1→3), and none of the states in this loop is 4. Hence from successor 2 there is a continuation where event4 never occurs.

Because there exists a next-state (event2) with a continuation that never reaches event4, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened. After event5 the next event can be one of {event2, event4, event6, event8}.
- C2 asserts that in the next state (i.e., after whatever next event occurs) event4 will eventually happen on all future paths.
- Counterexample branch: pick the next event = event2 (allowed). From event2 one allowed next event is event3; from event3 one allowed next event is event2. Thus the system can loop forever 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 … and thereby avoid event4 indefinitely.
- Because there exists a possible next state (the state after event2) from which event4 need not ever occur, C2 is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would require event1 to occur at every step from some time onward.
- But after any occurrence of event1 the next event must be one of {event4, event5, event7, event8, event9} — event1 is not among its successors. Therefore you cannot have two consecutive event1 occurrences, and so there can be no infinite suffix consisting solely of event1.
- Hence it is impossible for C1 to ever hold (even temporarily as ""always from that point on""), so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
False

Reason: C1 (""event1 always happens"") would require every step to be event1, but initially event3 occurred so C1 is already false. For C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") to be true there would need to be a time after which every subsequent event is event1. However, from event1 the next event must be one of {4,5,7,8,9} (event1 is not allowed to follow itself), so it's impossible to have all future events be event1. Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., from some point onward every step is event1).
- For C1 to eventually hold (C2), there must be a reached state after which every subsequent event is event1.
- Check successors: after event1 the next event must be one of {4,5,7,8,9} — event1 cannot follow itself. No event's successor set is {event1} alone (every state has at least one successor that is not event1).
- Therefore there is no reachable point that forces event1 at every future step; even if event1 occurs, the next step cannot be event1, so ""always event1"" can never hold.
- Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 occurs. From event5 the only allowed next event is event9 (5 -> 9).
- From event9 we may choose event1 (9 -> 1). From event1 we may choose event3 (1 -> 3). From event3 we may choose event5 (3 -> 5). That returns to the start of the same pattern.
- Those transitions form a cycle 5 -> 9 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 that never involves event2. Because the system can stay in that cycle forever, event2 is not guaranteed to eventually occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed, and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.
---

---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurs.
- After event5, event9 must happen. So event9 occurs.
- After event9, one possible next event is event2 (event9 -> event2 is allowed).
- Therefore event2 can (and thus eventually does) happen, so C1 holds.
- C2 states that C1 eventually holds; since C1 is true, C2 is true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rules say: after event2 the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event5, event6, event9}.
- C1 is ""event8 happens or event6 happens"".
- For C1 to hold in the next state (C2), the next event would need to be event6 or event8.
- From the allowed next events after event2, event6 is allowed but event8 is not; event1, event4, event5, and event9 are also allowed.
- Because there exist permitted next events (e.g., event1, event4, event5, or event9) that are neither event6 nor event8, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event5, event6, event9}.
- C1 (event8 or event6) would hold next only if event6 occurs (event8 is not an option right after event2).
- Since the next event could be event1, event4, event5, or event9 (not just event6), C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.
Therefore C2 (“C1 holds in the next state”) is not necessarily true.
---
We start in a state where event2 happened. The rule for event2 says the next event must be one of: event1, event4, event5, event6, or event9.

C1 is ""event8 happens or event6 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., immediately after the initial event2).

But from event2 the next event could be event1, event4, event5, event6, or event9. Since event1, event4, event5, and event9 are allowed next events that are neither event6 nor event8, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state. (For example, choosing event1 as the next event is a valid transition and falsifies C1.)

Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

1. Start: initially event4 happened.

2. The rules give possible immediate successors:
   - 4 -> {5, 6, 9}
   - 5 -> {2, 4, 8, 9}
   - 8 -> {1, 2, 6, 9}
   - 2 -> {6, 7, 8, 9}
   - 9 -> {2, 8}
   - 6 -> {4, 5, 9}
   - 1 -> {2, 4, 6, 9}
   - 7 -> {1,2,3,4,8,9}
   - 3 -> {1,2,5,6,7}

3. Counterexample showing C1 (if 8 then 4) is not guaranteed:
   - Choose 4 -> 5 -> 8 (all allowed).
   - From 8 choose 2 (allowed), then 2 -> 9 (allowed), then 9 -> 8 (allowed).
   - The cycle 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 8 can repeat indefinitely without ever visiting event4. Thus event8 can occur while no later event4 ever occurs, so C1 fails.

4. Counterexample showing event1 is not guaranteed:
   - From the start choose 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 6 ... (allowed choices). This infinite cycle never produces event1, so event1 is not forced to happen.

5. Since C2 requires both (event1 happens) and (C1 holds), and we have valid sequences that violate both parts, C2 is not true.

Final: False
---
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step, concise):

- From the rules, after event4 (the initial event) one possible next event is event5.
- After event5 a possible next event is event8. So event8 is reachable: 4 -> 5 -> 8.
- After event8 a possible next event is event2, and after event2 a possible next event is event8. Thus there is a cycle 8 -> 2 -> 8 -> 2 -> ... that can repeat indefinitely and never visit event4 (nor event1).
- Therefore C1 (""If event8 happens, then event4 happens"") is false because we have a valid sequence where event8 occurs but event4 never occurs afterward.
- Because C2 requires C1 to hold (and C1 is false), C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- Initial event4 occurred.
- From event4 we can follow 4 -> 5 -> 8, so event8 can happen.
- C1 asserts: ""If event8 happens, then event4 happens"" (i.e., every time an 8 occurs, a 4 must eventually occur).
- But after event8 the rules allow 8 -> 9 and 9 -> 8, so we can loop 8,9,8,9,... indefinitely without ever producing event4. This is a valid continuation under the given rules, so there exists a path where event8 occurs but event4 never does.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (false). Although event1 can occur on some paths, C2 requires both event1 and C1; because C1 fails, C2 is false."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are given an initial event (event4) and a directed graph of allowed next events after each event. C1 says ""event5 eventually happens."" C2 says ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event5 never happens). We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Key transitions (compact):
- 4 -> {1,3,5,6,8,9}
- 6 -> {1,3,5,7,8}
- 7 -> {1,2,6}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,8,9}
- 2 -> {1,5,8}
(and others, but these suffice)

Starting at event4, we can choose successors to avoid event5. One infinite path that never visits event5:
4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...
Each step is allowed by the rules (4->6, 6->7, 7->1, 1->2, 2->1, and repeat), and none of these nodes in the cycle is event5. Therefore it's possible to avoid event5 indefinitely, so ""event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event4 happens. From event4 you may choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 you may choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 you may choose event1 (allowed).
- Thus an infinite loop event4 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 ... is possible and contains no event5.
- Therefore event5 is not guaranteed to eventually happen, so ""C1 does not hold"" is true.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 occurs.
- From event4 one allowed successor is event1 (4 -> 1).
- From event1 one allowed successor is event2 (1 -> 2).
- From event2 one allowed successor is event1 (2 -> 1).
- Thus there is an infinite loop 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that never includes event5.
- Therefore event5 is not guaranteed to occur eventually on all possible sequences, so C1 (""Event5 eventually happens"") does not hold in general.
- C2 is the statement that C1 does not hold, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event4 happened.
- C1 = ""Event4 happens in the next state."" From event4 the allowed next events are {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, event9} — event4 is not among them — so C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., two steps from the initial state, event4 occurs). Although there is a possible two-step path 4 -> 5 -> 4 that would make C2 true, there are other allowed paths (for example 4 -> 1 -> 5) that do not lead to event4 in two steps. Because C2 is not guaranteed by the rules, it is not true in general.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning: C1 says ""event4 happens in the next state"" (X event4). C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (XX event4), i.e. event4 occurs two steps from the initial state.

Initially event4 occurred. After event4 the allowed next events include event1. If we choose event1 as the immediate next event (which is permitted), then after event1 the only allowed next events are event5 or event6 — neither is event4. Thus there is a permitted run where event4 does not occur two steps after the initial state, so XX event4 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (which asserts ""Event1 always happens"" and ""event8 happens"") is true given the rules and initial event6.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initial event: event6.
- From event6 the next event must be either event2 or event9.
- Choose event2. From event2 the next event must be one of {3,4,7,8}.
- Choose event3. From event3 the next event must be one of {2,4,8,9}.
- Choose event2 again. Thus we have the cycle 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> … which stays entirely within {2,3} forever.
- This infinite path starting from the initial event6 never visits event1 (nor event8). Therefore event1 does not ""always happen"" (it is not guaranteed in all possible runs), so C1 is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C2 requires C1 (event1 always happens) and event8 happens.
- From the rules, after event6 (the initial event) we can choose event2.
- From event2 we can choose event3, and from event3 we can choose event2 again. So there is a valid infinite trace 6 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... that never visits event1.
- Therefore event1 does not always happen (C1 is false), so C2 (which requires C1) is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):
- Start: event6 occurs.
- From event6 you can go to event2 (6 -> 2).
- From event2 you can go to event4 (2 -> 4).
- From event4 you can go back to event6 (4 -> 6).

This gives an infinite cycle 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> ... that never includes event1. Therefore event1 is not guaranteed to occur in all possible runs, so C1 is false. Since C2 requires C1 to hold (and event8 to happen), C2 is also false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 states: ""Event7 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e., the current event is 7 or 2).
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., at every point along the execution, the current event is either 7 or 2).
- The initial event is event6, which is neither 2 nor 7, so C1 is already false at the start. Thus C2 cannot hold.
- Even ignoring the initial step, from event6 we can transition to event1 (allowed), and event1 is also neither 2 nor 7, providing a reachable counterexample.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reason: C2 asserts that ""event7 or event2"" holds in every state. The initial state is event6, which is neither event7 nor event2, so the property already fails at the start. Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start at event6 (given).
- We want to know if on every possible sequence from event6, at some point event7 or event2 occurs. To refute ""always holds"" it suffices to find one valid infinite sequence avoiding both 2 and 7.
- Using the given transition rules (summarized):
  - 6 -> {1,3,5,7,9}
  - 3 -> {1,7,8,9}
  - 1 -> {2,4,5,9}
  - 4 -> {3,6,7,8,9}
  - 5 -> {7,8}
  - 8 -> {1,2,6,7,9}
  - 9 -> {2,4,5,7,8}
  - 2 -> {3,5,7}
  - 7 -> {1,3,4,8,9}
- There is a cycle that never visits 2 or 7: 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 and repeat.
  - 6 -> 3 is allowed.
  - 3 -> 1 is allowed.
  - 1 -> 4 is allowed.
  - 4 -> 6 is allowed.
- This infinite path contains no event2 and no event7, so C1 (event7 or event2 happens) is not guaranteed to hold on all executions.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning: from the initial event1 you can choose the transitions 1 -> 7, 7 -> 8, 8 -> 1 and repeat indefinitely. None of those transitions produce event5, so there is an infinite behavior that never visits event5. Thus ""Event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed, so C1 does not hold and C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts that event5 eventually happens in every continuation from the initial event1.
- From event1 you can go to event4, and from event4 you can go back to event1 (1 -> 4 -> 1). Repeating that cycle (1,4,1,4,...) avoids event5 forever.
- Because there exists a valid infinite trace starting at the initial event that never reaches event5, C1 does not hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event1 has happened.
- From event1 you may go to event2 (among other options).
- From event2 you may go to event3.
- From event3 you may go back to event2.
- Thus there is a valid infinite sequence 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... that never visits event5.

Because at least one allowed run from the initial state avoids event5 forever, ""Event5 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, so C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 has happened.
- From event7, the next state must be exactly one of {event1, event3, event6, event9} (the rules give a single alternative choice ""either ... or ..."").
- C1 asserts ""event9 happens and event3 happens"" — that requires both event9 and event3 to hold in the same state.
- Because each transition yields exactly one event, the next state cannot simultaneously be event9 and event3.
- Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened.
- The rules say after event7 the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event6, event9}.
- C1 asserts ""event9 happens and event3 happens"" (both in the same state).
- A single next state can contain only one of those events, so it cannot contain both event9 and event3 simultaneously.
Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
We start with event7 initially. The rule after event7 requires that in the next state exactly one of {event1, event3, event6, event9} occurs. C1 asserts that both event9 and event3 happen (conjunction). But the successor constraint from event7 allows at most one of those to hold in the next state, so the next state cannot make both event9 and event3 true simultaneously. Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 requires both (a) event3 happens and (b) C1 holds (C1: whenever event1 happens then event4 happens).
- From the context, initially event5 occurs and from event5 one allowed next event is event1 (5 -> 1).
- From event1 one allowed next event is event5 (1 -> 5). So the sequence 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ... is allowed.
- That infinite loop never produces event4 or event3, so event3 does not have to happen, and event4 does not have to happen after event1.
- Thus C1 is not guaranteed, and event3 is not guaranteed; therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: False.

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" The rules explicitly state: ""After event1, either event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen."" Event4 is not among the allowed immediate successors of event1. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the conjunction ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false regardless of whether event3 occurs.

Thus C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event8 always happens"" — i.e., from some time onward every step is event8.
- From the given rules, after event8 the next event must be one of {2,3,5,7,9}. Event8 cannot follow event8 directly.
- Therefore it is impossible to have event8 at every time step from some point onward (you cannot have two consecutive event8s).
- Since C1 can never become true at any point, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis: C1 is ""Event8 always happens."" C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there is a time after which every step is event8).

- Examine the transitions: after event8, the allowed next events are {2,3,5,7,9} — event8 is not among them. Thus an occurrence of event8 cannot be immediately followed by another event8.

- Consequence: it is impossible to have two consecutive event8 occurrences. Therefore you cannot reach a point after which every subsequent step is event8 (that would require 8→8 transitions).

- Conclusion: C1 can never become true from some point onward, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 says ""Event8 always happens"" — i.e., from some point onward every step is event8 (or equivalently, at every time point event8 holds).
- Initially event8 occurs, but the transition rule after event8 allows only {2,3,5,7,9} — event8 is not among the successors of event8.
- Therefore it is impossible to have two consecutive event8 occurrences, so you can never reach a point after which every future event is event8.
- Hence C1 never holds at any time, and so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event6 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds and event4 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event6 happened."" That means event6 did happen (at least initially).

Step 3 — trace the consequence for the hypothesis:
- C1 claims event6 does not happen, which directly contradicts the given initial fact that event6 happened. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and also that event4 happens). Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true regardless of whether event4 occurs.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event6 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event4 happens."" So C2 is true only if event6 does not happen and event4 does happen.

Step 2 — Check given facts:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event6 happened."" That directly contradicts C1.

Step 3 — Conclusion:
- Since event6 did happen, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (which requires C1) cannot be true regardless of whether event4 happens.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- The context states ""Initially, event6 happened."" Therefore the claim C1 ""Event6 does not happen"" is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (C1 holds AND event4 happens). Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true.

Thus C2 is False."

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Start at event1 (given).
- Choose the allowed transitions: event1 -> event5 (event5 is allowed after event1).
- From event5 choose event4 (event4 is allowed after event5).
- From event4 choose event1 (event1 is allowed after event4).
- Repeat this cycle: 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> ...

None of the events in this infinite cycle is event2 or event7, so there exists a valid execution in which ""Event2 happens or Event7 happens"" never holds. Therefore C1 is not true on all executions, and C2 is False.

False.

Reasoning: C1 is the proposition ""Event2 happens or event7 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 holds always (at every point). But initially event1 happened, which is neither event2 nor event7, so C1 is already false at the initial state. Therefore C1 does not hold always, and C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 holds and event6 happens"") is True or False.

C1: Event5 always happens — i.e., every possible sequence starting from the initial event contains event5.
C2: C1 is true and event6 happens.

From the rules, starting at event9 we may go to event2, event4, event7, or event8. Consider the choice 9 → 2. From event2 we can go to event6 (and from event6 we must go back to event2). Thus the infinite trace 9 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 6 → ... is valid and never includes event5. Therefore C1 is false (event5 does not always happen).

Since C2 requires C1 to hold, and C1 is false, C2 is false as well (regardless of whether event6 occurs on some traces).

Final answer: False
---
Summary of the hypothesis
- C1: Event5 always happens (i.e., in every possible future from the start).
- C2: C1 holds and event6 happens.

Reasoning
1. Build the transition graph from the rules (condensed):
   - 1 → {3,5,9}
   - 2 → {6,7,8}
   - 3 → {1,4,8}
   - 4 → {3,6}
   - 5 → {1,2,3,7,8}
   - 6 → {2}
   - 7 → {2,5,9}
   - 8 → {2,3,6,7}
   - 9 → {2,4,7,8}
   Initial event: 9.

2. Find a counterexample to C1 (show a possible path that never visits event5).
   - From 9 choose 2.
   - From 2 choose 6.
   - From 6 the only option is 2.
   - Repeat 2 → 6 → 2 → 6 → ...
   This infinite path never visits event5, so event5 is not guaranteed to always happen.

3. Conclusion for C2:
   - C1 is false, so the conjunction ""C1 holds and event6 happens"" is false (even though event6 can occur on some paths, C1 fails).

Final answer
False
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event5 always happens"" AND ""event6 happens"") is True.

1) Interpret transitions as a directed graph (edges ""A -> B"" meaning after A, one of B must happen). Relevant edges:
- 9 -> {2,4,7,8}
- 2 -> {6,7,8}
- 6 -> {2}
- 7 -> {2,5,9}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,7,8}
- (others exist but not needed)

2) Show C1 (""Event5 always happens"") is false by counterexample path:
Start at initial event9, choose 9 -> 2, then 2 -> 6, then 6 -> 2, then repeat 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> ... . This infinite path visits only events {2,6} and never visits event5. So event5 is not guaranteed to occur in all possible sequences; C1 is false.

3) C2 requires C1 to hold (and also that event6 happens). Even though event6 does occur on the counterexample path, the conjunction C1 ∧ (event6 happens) fails because C1 is false. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 says
- C1 is ""event4 happens and event7 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens"", i.e. ""(event4 and event7) OR event5"".
- Since the context says event4 happens initially, C2 will be true only if event7 occurs at some point or event5 occurs at some point.

Step 2 — can we avoid both event7 and event5?
We need a possible sequence consistent with the ""After ..."" rules that never produces event7 and never produces event5. If such a sequence exists, C2 is not entailed.

Use these relevant transition options (taken from the context):
- After event4: {2,3,8,9}
- After event2: {1,3,5,7,9}
- After event3: {1,2,7,8,9}
- After event1: {2,3,5,6,7,9}
- After event9: {1,2,4,7,8}
- After event6: must do 4
- After event8: {1,3,4,7,9}

Construct a cycle that avoids 5 and 7:
- Start: 4 (given).
- 4 -> 2 (allowed).
- 2 -> 3 (allowed).
- 3 -> 1 (allowed).
- 1 -> 9 (allowed).
- 9 -> 4 (allowed).

This returns to 4 and contains no event5 or event7. Each transition chosen is permitted by the rules and at each choice we avoided the options 5 and 7 that were available. Thus there is a valid infinite (or repeating) execution in which neither event7 nor event5 ever occurs.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where neither event7 nor event5 happens, C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is False.
---
You ask whether C2 (""C1 holds or event5 happens"") must be true given the rules. C1 is ""event4 happens and event7 happens."" Since event4 is given initially, C2 reduces to asking whether event7 or event5 must inevitably occur.

Look at the allowed transitions from the facts:
- From event4 the next event must be one of {2,3,8,9}.
- From event2 the next event can be {1,3,5,7,9}.
- From event3 the next event can be {1,2,7,8,9}.

We can choose a sequence that avoids both event5 and event7 indefinitely, for example:
- Start: event4 (given)
- Choose event2 (allowed after 4)
- Choose event3 (allowed after 2)
- Choose event2 (allowed after 3)
- Repeat 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 ... forever

This infinite alternating sequence uses only events 2 and 3 after the initial 4 and never produces event5 or event7. Therefore neither event7 nor event5 is forced by the rules, so C1 need not hold and event5 need not happen. Hence C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event6 (allowed).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens.
- From event1 the next event can be event3 or event9. From event3 one possible next is event2; from event2 one possible next is event1. Thus there is a valid infinite execution 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> ... that never includes event5 or event6.
- Also, no rule ever produces event6 (no event lists event6 as an outcome), so event6 is unreachable; thus C1 would require event5, but event5 is not forced (it can be avoided as above).
- Therefore C1 (""event5 or event6 happens"") does not hold on all possible executions, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event5 happens or event6 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting this: from the given initial event and rules, in every possible future sequence an event5 or event6 must occur. So we must decide whether every possible run inevitably contains 5 or 6.

Step 2 — relevant rules (condensed)
- Initially event1 happened.
- After 1 → {3, 9}
- After 3 → {2, 4, 7, 8}
- After 4 → {2, 5, 7}
- After 2 → {1, 3, 4}
- After 7 → {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- After 8 → {4, 7}
- After 5 → {2, 8}
- After 9 → {1, 7, 8}
- After 6 → {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}

(Other duplicates in the context are the same rules.)

Step 3 — find if a run can avoid both 5 and 6
From the start 1, choose transitions that never pick 5 or 6:
- 1 → 3
- 3 → 4
- 4 → 2   (avoid choosing 5)
- 2 → 1

This gives a cycle 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 1 that repeats indefinitely and never produces event5 or event6. Since the rules allow nondeterministic choices, this is a valid possible run that avoids 5 and 6 forever.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a valid run from the initial event that never contains event5 or event6, it is not the case that ""event5 or event6 always happens."" Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says: ""Event5 happens or event6 happens.""
- C2 says C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible sequence from the initial event).
- From the context, the initial event is event1. After event1, either event3 or event9 must happen.
- Choose the allowed sequence that avoids event5 and event6: event1 → event3 → event2 → event1 → ... (repeat). Each step follows the rules:
  - after event1 → event3 (allowed),
  - after event3 → event2 (allowed),
  - after event2 → event1 (allowed).
- This cycle never includes event5 or event6, so there exists a valid run where C1 is false at every step.
- Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is false."

Votes: {'True': 2, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True.

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- Start at event2 (given).
- From 2 you can choose 5 (2 -> 5).
- From 5 you can choose 6 (5 -> 6).
- From 6 you can choose 1 (6 -> 1).
- From 1 you can choose 2 (1 -> 2).

This yields the cycle 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 which contains no event4. Because each step is allowed by the rules, you can repeat this cycle forever and thus produce an infinite execution that never visits event4.

Therefore ""Event4 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed (there exists an execution avoiding event4), so C1 does not hold and C2 is True.
---
False

Reasoning: The hypothesis C1 (""Event4 eventually happens"") is satisfied because initially event2 occurred and the rules allow directly after event2 that event4 happens (after event2 either event3, event4, event5, event7, or event8). Thus C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: Event4 eventually happens (i.e., on every possible future trace from the initial state, event4 occurs at some point).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event4 is not guaranteed to ever happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — relevant transitions (condensed):
- Start: event2.
- 2 -> {3,4,5,7,8}
- 3 -> {1,4,5,8}
- 5 -> {3,4,6}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,8,9}
- 8 -> {2,4,9}
- 9 -> {2,4,6}
- 6 -> {1,2}
- 7 -> {1,3,5,6,9}
- 4 -> {2,5,6}

Step 3 — search for a path that avoids event4 forever:
- From 2 pick 5 (allowed).
- From 5 pick 3 (allowed).
- From 3 pick 5 (allowed).
This yields an infinite loop 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 5 -> 3 -> ... that never visits event4. Since such a path exists, event4 is not inevitable.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 is True.

Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7 one allowed next event is event3 (rule: after event7, either event2, event3, event5, event6, event8, or event9).
- After event3 one allowed next event is event7 (rule: after event3, either event7 or event9).
- Thus a valid sequence is: event7 → event3 → event7 → event3 → ... which never produces event2 or event1.
- In that sequence C1 (event7 and event2) is false and event1 never happens, so ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" is false.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the premises — False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context gives: initially event7 happened.
- From event7 one allowed successor is event3. From event3 one allowed successor is event7. So the sequence 7 → 3 → 7 → 3 → ... is a valid infinite trace that never produces event1 or event2.
- C1 requires event7 and event2; in this trace event2 never occurs, so C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" In the constructed trace neither C1 nor event1 holds, so C2 is false in that model.
- Because a valid sequence exists where C2 is false, C2 is not entailed by the context.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- C2 requires either (event7 and event2) or event1.
- We know event7 happened initially, but event2 and event1 are not forced.
- Counterexample sequence: event7 -> event3 -> event7 -> event3 -> ...  
  - After event7, event3 is allowed; after event3, event7 is allowed. This infinitely repeating sequence obeys the rules and never produces event2 or event1.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed, so the correct answer is False."

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- We start with event5.
- From the rules: after event5 we may go to 4 (5 -> 4).
- After event4 we may go to 8 (4 -> 8) — note 4 had options {8,9}, choose 8 to avoid 9.
- After event8 we may go to 1 (8 -> 1) — 8's options are {1,2,4,5,7}, none force 9.
- After event1 we may go to 3 (1 -> 3) — 1's options are {3,4,7,9}, choose 3 to avoid 9.
- After event3 we may go to 6 (3 -> 6) — 3's options include 6.
- After event6 we may go back to 3 (6 -> 3) — 6's options are {3,7}.

Thus we can follow 5,4,8,1,3,6,3,6,3,6,... indefinitely, never taking event9. Because there exists an infinite path that never makes C1 true, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold; therefore C2 is False.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event9 happened, so the next event can be 2, 5, or 6.
- To show C2 false it suffices to find one possible next state from which C1 (""event8 always happens"") does not hold.
- Take the next state event2 (allowed from event9). From event2 one possible next event is event1. From event1 one possible next event is event2. Thus there is a loop 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that never produces event8.
- Therefore from the next state event2, event8 does not always happen, so C1 is false in that next state.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — what C2 asks:
C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in every immediate successor state of the initial state, C1 must be true. C1 is ""Event8 always happens"" (i.e., from that state onward, every step must be event8 or event8 is inevitable at every step).

Step 2 — look at the immediate successors of the initial state:
Initially event9 happened. After event9, the next event may be one of {event2, event5, event6}.

Step 3 — show C1 fails in at least one successor:
Consider the successor where event2 happens. From event2 you can go to event3, and from event3 you can return to event2 (2 → 3 → 2). This 2–3 cycle can repeat forever and never include event8. Thus, starting from the successor state ""event2"", event8 does not always happen. So C1 is false in that next state.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
Since C1 does not hold in every immediate successor (it fails for the successor event2), C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning: initial state is event9, so the next state can be event2, event5, or event6. From event2 there is a cycle 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 ... (since 2 -> 3 and 3 -> 2 are allowed), which never visits event8. Thus event8 is not guaranteed to occur on all futures starting from the next state, so ""Event8 always happens"" does not hold in the next state."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says “event6 always happens” (i.e., at every future step event6 occurs). From the initial event1 there is a permitted transition to event4 (since after event1 one may go to 4). From event4 you can go back to event1, and repeat 1→4→1→4… forever. This infinite run never contains event6, so C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2 says “C1 holds in the next state.” That would require that in every possible immediate successor of the initial state, event6 holds at all future times. But one allowed immediate successor is event4, and as shown above from event4 you can forever avoid event6 (4→1→4→…). Thus C1 does not hold in that next state either.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 occurred. From event1 the next event can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.
- To show C1 (""event6 always happens"") fails in the next state, it suffices to find a possible future from one of these next events that avoids event6 forever.
- From event4 we can go to event1 (4 -> 1), and from event1 we can go back to event4 (1 -> 4). That gives the infinite loop 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> ... which never visits event6.
- Therefore event6 is not guaranteed in all futures from the next state, so C1 does not hold there. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., in all future steps event6 will occur).
- From the initial state event1, one possible next event is event4 (since after event1 the allowed next events include 4).
- From event4 you can go back to event1 (allowed), and then again to event4, etc. The cycle 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 ... never includes event6, so there exists a future run from the next state (event4) in which event6 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 is not true in that next state, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start with event6 (given).

- From event6 one allowed next event is event4 (rule: after event6 → event4 is possible). So we can have 6 → 4.
- From event4 one allowed next event is event2 (rule: after event4 → event2 is possible). So we can have 6 → 4 → 2. Thus C1 (event4 and event2 happen) can be satisfied.
- From event2 one allowed next event is event8 (after event2 → event8), and from event8 one allowed next event is event3 (after event8 → event3). So we can extend to 6 → 4 → 2 → 8 → 3, making event3 occur as well.

Therefore C2 (""event3 happens and C1 holds"") can be satisfied. Answer: True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happened.
- From event6 the next event must be one of {1,2,4,7,8,9} — event3 is not required immediately.
- To make C2 true we need (a) C1 (both event4 and event2 occur) and (b) event3 occurs.
- There is a valid sequence that avoids both event2/event4 and event3 forever: choose 6 -> 7, then from 7 choose 6, then 6 -> 7, etc. (After 7 the choices are {3,6}; always choosing 6 and from 6 choosing 7 is allowed.) This path never produces event2, event4, or event3.
- Because such a path exists, C2 is not forced by the given rules and therefore is not necessarily true.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning summary:
- The rules describe nondeterministic transitions starting from initial event6.
- From event6 you can go to event1 (allowed), and from event1 you can return to event6 (allowed). So a valid trace is 6 → 1 → 6 → 1 → ...
- That trace never produces event2, event4, or event3, so C1 (event4 and event2 happen) fails and therefore C2 (event3 and C1) also fails.
- Because there exists at least one valid execution that makes C2 false, C2 is not guaranteed; thus the hypothesis is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every situation the next state is event2).

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and transitions:
- Initially event6 happened.
- The rules include: ""After event6, either event2, event3, event4, event5, or event7 must happen.""

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- From event6 the next event could be event2, but it could also be event3, event4, event5, or event7. So event2 is possible but not guaranteed.
- Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state (it can be false on some branches).
- Since C1 can fail in at least one reachable case, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- Initially event6 occurred. The rules say: after event6, the next event may be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5, event7}.
- Because the next event can be event3 (or 4, 5, or 7) and is not forced to be event2, C1 is not guaranteed.
- C2 claims C1 always holds (i.e., event2 must occur in every next state). The existence of allowed next states other than event2 is a counterexample, so C2 is false.
---
Step-by-step reasoning

- Initially event6 happened.
- The rules state: ""After event6, either event2, event3, event4, event5, or event7 must happen.""
- Therefore the next state could be event2, but it could also be event3, event4, event5, or event7.
- C1 asserts that event2 happens in the next state. That is not guaranteed by the rules (event2 is only one possible next event).
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., event2 must always be the next event). Since other next events are possible, C1 does not always hold.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Consolidate transitions:
  - 7 -> {2,3,9}
  - 2 -> {6,8}
  - 3 -> {2,4,5,6,8,9}
  - 9 -> {3,4,5,7}
  - 6 -> {1,2,4,9}
  - 8 -> {5,9}
  - 4 -> {3}
  - 5 -> {1,4,7}
  - 1 -> {2,7,8,9}
- C1 asserts: ""Event8 always happens"" (i.e., on every possible run). To refute C1 it suffices to exhibit a run with no event8.
- From the initial event7 take 7 -> 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> 6 -> ... . These transitions are allowed (2 -> 6 and 6 -> 2), producing an infinite loop that never visits event8. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 is ""Event8 happens or C1 holds."" On the exhibited run neither disjunct holds (event8 never occurs, and C1 is false), so C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event7 happens.
- From 7, choose event2 (allowed).
- From 2, choose event6 (allowed; the alternative would be event8).
- From 6, choose event2 (allowed; 6 → 2 is permitted).
- Now we can repeat 2 → 6 → 2 → 6 … indefinitely.

This infinite run contains no event8, so ""Event8 happens"" is false in that possible sequence. Because there is at least one possible sequence where event8 does not occur, the claim C1 (""Event8 always happens"") is false. Therefore in that sequence both disjuncts of C2 (""Event8 happens"" OR ""C1 holds"") are false, so C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Thus C2 is False.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event7. From event7 choose event3.
- From event3 choose event5.
- From event5 choose event7.
- This gives the cycle 7 → 3 → 5 → 7 repeated indefinitely.
- That infinite run never includes event8, so ""Event8 happens"" is false in that run.
- Because there exists a run where event8 never occurs, the claim C1 (""Event8 always happens"") is also false.
- Hence both disjuncts of C2 are false in that run, so C2 is not guaranteed and is False."

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 is ""Event2 does not happen.""

Start state: event3 happened. The rules say: after event3, either event1, event2, event6, or event8 must happen. Therefore from the initial state event2 can occur immediately (path: event3 -> event2). That means C1 is not guaranteed (there exists a possible sequence where event2 happens). Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event2 never happens in any allowed sequence).
- Initially event3 happens. The rule ""After event3, either event1, event2, event6, or event8 must happen"" allows event2 to occur immediately after the initial event3.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence in which event2 happens, so C1 is not always true and C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible execution from the initial condition, Event2 never occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions (transitions):
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event6, event8} must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible execution:
- From the initial event3, the rules allow event2 to happen immediately (event3 → event2 is permitted).

Thus there exists a valid execution in which Event2 does occur, so C1 is not guaranteed in all executions. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start in state event2. The rules say: ""After event2, either event1, event4, event5, or event9 must happen."" None of those is event3, so event3 cannot be the immediate next state. Therefore C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false. C2 asserts that C1 always holds, which is therefore false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (i.e., the immediate successor event is event3.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every case the next event is event3.)

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- The allowed successors after event2 are: event1, event4, event5, or event9. (No rule lists event3 as a direct successor of event2.)

Step 3 — reasoning
- From the initial state (event2), the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event5, event9}. Event3 is not among them, so C1 is false for the initial step.
- Because C1 is false in at least one case, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state the next event is event3 (C1 is true in all states).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and the initial state:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, either event1, event4, event5, or event9 must happen."" (no event3 listed).

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2:
- From the initial state (event2), the next event can be event1 (or event4, event5, or event9). Those are allowed next events and are not event3.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 happens next"") is not guaranteed in that state.

Conclusion:
- C2 (that C1 always holds) is false.

- To show C2 is false we need only one possible next-state where C1 (""event7 always happens"") does not hold.
- Take the next state = event1 (it is allowed after event6). From event1 the allowed next events include {2,5,6,8}. In particular event6 is allowed, and from event6 event1 is allowed again.
- So there is a possible infinite loop ... -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> 6 ... that never produces event7.
- Therefore in that next state (event1) event7 is not guaranteed to happen, so C1 does not hold there. Hence C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happened. From event6 a next event could be event1 (since event1 is one of event6's allowed successors).
- From event1 we can go to event5, and from event5 back to event1 (both allowed). That gives an infinite cycle: event1 → event5 → event1 → ...
- This infinite path never contains event7, so event7 is not guaranteed to happen in that next-state future.
- Therefore C1 (""Event7 always happens"") does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event7 always happens"" (i.e., on every possible future path).
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state (i.e., from every successor of the current state this inevitability must hold).
- Initially event6 occurred, so a next event can be any of {1,3,4,5,8,9} (the successors of 6).
- Take the successor 1. From 1 we can choose 5; from 5 choose 3; from 3 choose 4; from 4 choose 3; and then repeat 3↔4 forever. None of these states are event7, and these choices are allowed by the transition rules, so there is an infinite path starting at the next state (via 1) that never reaches event7.
- Because there exists a possible next-event choice (1) leading to a path that avoids event7 forever, event7 is not inevitable in the next state. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning: C1 holds because initially event8 happened. From event8 we can follow a cycle that avoids event3: 8 -> 1 (allowed), 1 -> 4 (allowed), 4 -> 8 (allowed), and repeat. Event3 can only occur after event6, but this cycle never visits event6, so event3 is not forced. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is not guaranteed. Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- C1 is true because event8 happened initially.
- From event8 we can choose event9 (allowed), and from event9 we can choose event8 (allowed). Repeating 8 → 9 → 8 → 9 … is a valid infinite run under the given rules.
- That run never visits event6 (the only step that can lead to event3) and thus never visits event3.
- Therefore C1 holding does not force event3 to happen in all possible evolutions, so the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.
---
Step-by-step:

- C1 is ""event1 happens or event8 happens."" The context states initially event8 happened, so C1 holds.
- C2 claims that if C1 holds then event3 happens (i.e., event3 must eventually occur).
- From the rules: after event8 → {1,4,5,9}; after event1 → {4,6,8}; after event4 → {7,8,9}; after event7 → {2,5,8,9}. So there is a cycle that avoids event3: 8 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 8 → ... This sequence can repeat indefinitely without ever reaching event3.
- Because there exists a possible (allowed) path from C1 that never leads to event3, event3 is not guaranteed when C1 holds.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C1 says: whenever event1 occurs, event5 must (eventually) occur. To refute it it suffices to give a valid sequence where event1 happens but event5 never happens.

From the rules: 8 -> 1 is allowed. From 1 -> 2 is allowed. From 2 -> 3 is allowed. From 3 -> 1 is allowed. So starting at the given initial event8 we can follow the cycle

8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ... 

which contains event1 but never contains event5. Thus C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event5 happens."" Interpreted as a necessary implication: whenever event1 occurs, event5 must (eventually) occur.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true iff there is a possible legal sequence where event1 occurs but event5 never occurs.

Step 2 — examine the rules / graph
- From event8 (initial): successors include 1.
- From event1: successors are {2,4,6}.
- From event6: successors include 1 (and others).
So a legal cycle 1 → 6 → 1 is allowed and contains no event5.

Step 3 — counterexample to C1
- Start from the given initial event8, take 8 → 1 (allowed), then 1 → 6 (allowed), then 6 → 1 (allowed), and repeat. This infinite legal continuation contains event1 but never contains event5. Therefore event5 is not inevitable after event1.

Conclusion
- C1 is false (it does not hold), so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Reasoning:
- From the context, after event1 the allowed next events are {2,4,6}.
- After event6 the allowed next events include event1 (6 -> 1).
- Thus there is a possible cycle 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> 6 ... that never visits event5.
- Also, starting from the initial event8 we can go 8 -> 1 and then enter that cycle, so event5 need not occur after event1.

Therefore C1 (""If event1 happens, then event5 happens"") does not hold. C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happened, so the ""event7 happens"" part of C2 is satisfied.
- But C1 requires that event8 eventually happens. From event7 the next event can be 1, 6, or 8. If we choose 1, then from 1 we can choose 2, and from 2 we can choose 1 again — producing the infinite cycle 7 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... which never includes event8.
- Because there exists a valid continuation that avoids event8 forever, event8 is not guaranteed to eventually happen. Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold, and C2 (C1 and event7) is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 requires that event8 eventually happens and event7 happens.
- event7 has already happened initially, so the only nontrivial part is whether event8 must eventually happen.
- From the rules: after event7 one may choose event1 (or event6 or event8). From event1 one may choose event2. From event2 one may choose event1. Thus there is a valid infinite sequence 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that never includes event8.
- Because a permissible continuation exists that avoids event8, event8 is not guaranteed to eventually happen (C1 is false). Therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event7 happened.
- From event7 the next event must be either event1, event6, or event8.
- To show C2 is not guaranteed, it suffices to exhibit a valid continuation that never produces event8. Take the choices:
  - 7 -> 1 (allowed),
  - 1 -> 2 (allowed),
  - 2 -> 1 (allowed),
  - repeat 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... indefinitely.
- This infinite path is consistent with all given ""after"" rules and never visits event8, so event8 does not necessarily eventually happen.
- Since C1 (event8 eventually happens) is not guaranteed, the conjunction C2 (C1 and event7 happens) is not guaranteed either (event7 did happen initially, but C1 can fail).

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning summary:
- ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) would mean every state/event in all futures is event1. That is already false because the initial event is event7, not event1.
- C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state. From event7 the next event can be 4, 5, or 6. In those successor states it is not guaranteed that every future event will be event1 (indeed some choices lead to non-1 events), so C1 does not hold in the next state.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step the event is event1).
- Initially event7 happened. From event7 a next event can be 4, 5, or 6.
- If the next state is event6, then from event6 the allowed successors are {event2, event3, event4, event5, event8} — none are event1, so event1 does not always occur thereafter.
- Thus C1 does not hold in that next state, so C2 is false.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., in every future state/event).

1. From the context, initially event7 happened. After event7, the next event may be 4, 5, or 6.
2. C2 requires that in the next state (whichever of those occurs) C1 is true — i.e., from that state onward event1 must occur in every future step on every possible path.
3. Take the possible next state event4 (allowed after  initial 7). From event4 one possible transition is to event2. From event2 one possible transition is to event3, and from event3 one possible transition is back to event2. Thus there is a path 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... that never visits event1.
4. Because from the next state (e.g. event4) there exists a continuing path that never produces event1, C1 does not hold in that next state. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 states ""Event1 always happens."" C2 states that C1 always holds (i.e., that ""Event1 always happens"" is true).
- The context begins with event2 happening initially. That already contradicts ""Event1 always happens"" because the initial event is event2, not event1.
- Also, after event2 the allowed next events are {event3, event4, event5, event7, event8, event9} — event1 is not required (and in fact cannot occur immediately), so there are traces where event1 does not occur at that step.
- Therefore C1 is not true, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., C2 is asserting that C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the initial condition:
- Initially, event2 happened.

Step 3 — check C1 against the initial condition:
- If Event1 ""always happens"", it must hold at the initial step as well. But the initial event is event2 (not event1), so C1 is already violated.

Conclusion:
- C2 (that C1 always holds) is False.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 is ""Event1 always happens.""

Interpretation used: ""C1 always happens"" means that in every allowed (infinite) execution trace Event1 occurs at every step (or at least occurs somewhere in every trace). Either way, C2 asserts that C1 holds for all possible traces generated by the given transition rules.

Step-by-step reasoning
1. Initial event is event2 (given).
2. From event2 the allowed next events include event3 (the rules explicitly list 3 among the choices after event2).
3. From event3 the allowed next events include event2 (the rules list 2 among the choices after event3).
4. Therefore there is a valid infinite trace that alternates event2 and event3 forever: 2,3,2,3,2,3,...
5. That trace never contains event1, so C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false in that trace.
6. Since C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., holds for all traces), and we have exhibited a valid trace where C1 fails, C2 is false.

False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules say that after event1 the next event must be one of {event6, event7, event9}. Event8 is not among these, so ""event8 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event7 to happen; since C1 is false, C2 cannot hold.

False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurred. The rules say that after event1 the next event must be one of {event6, event7, event9}.
- Event8 is not among these, so C1 (""event8 happens in the next state"") cannot hold.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event7 to happen; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event6, event7, or event9 must happen"" means the very next state can only be event6, event7, or event9.
- Therefore event8 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- C1 says ""eventually event2 happens.""
- Start is event5, whose successors include event1, event3, or event7 (as well as event2).
- There is a valid infinite path that never visits event2: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> ... (all those transitions are allowed).
- Along that path event2 never occurs, so ""eventually event2 happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 is not necessarily true.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" Note eventually(eventually p) is equivalent to eventually p, so C2 is equivalent to C1 and is likewise not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- From the initial event5, one allowed successor is event2 (after event5, either event1, event2, event3, or event7 must happen). So there is a path 5 → 2 and thus ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true.
- Since C1 already holds at the start, the statement ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also true.
---
C2 says that C1 (which is ""Event2 eventually happens"") will eventually hold — i.e. that event2 is guaranteed to occur at some future point.

From event5 (the start) one allowed sequence is 5 → 1 → 3 → 7 → 5, and that cycle can be repeated indefinitely (each listed transition in the cycle is allowed). This infinite loop never visits event2, so event2 is not guaranteed to occur.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start in the initial state where event5 happened.

From the rules: ""After event5, either event6, or event9 must happen."" (this rule appears repeatedly but consistently gives the same two options).

C1 is ""event7 happens or event8 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., immediately after the next event).

From event5, the next event must be either event6 or event9. Neither 6 nor 9 is event7 or event8, so C1 does not hold in that next state. (Although from event9 a later state could lead to 7 or 8, C2 requires C1 in the immediate next state.)

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happens.
- The rules say: after event5, either event6 or event9 must happen. No rule allows event7 or event8 immediately after event5.
- C1 asserts that event7 or event8 happens. C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state (i.e., the immediate successor).
- Since the immediate successor of event5 can only be event6 or event9, C1 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: event7 happens or event8 happens.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the immediate successor of the current state).

Step 2 — examine initial condition and transitions:
- Initially event5 happened.
- From the rules: after event5, either event6 or event9 must happen (this is given).

Step 3 — check C1 in the next state:
- The immediate next state after event5 is either event6 or event9.
- Neither event6 nor event9 is event7 or event8, so C1 (event7 or event8) does not hold in that next state.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning: C1 states ""Event4 eventually happens."" C2 says ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" That is just the assertion ""if event4 eventually happens, then event4 happens"" — a tautological implication of C1 to itself. Whether or not the transition rules permit event4 is irrelevant to the logical form: assuming C1 is true, event4 does occur, so C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning summary:
- From the initial event9 we have a path 9 -> 2 -> 4 (since after 9 one possible next is 2, and after 2 one possible next is 4), so event4 is reachable — C1 holds.
- C2 states ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" C1 is the statement that event4 eventually happens, so assuming C1 directly yields that event4 happens. Hence C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens.""

Step 2 — check reachability of event4 from the initial state
- Initially event9 happened.
- From event9 one allowed next event is event3.
- From event3 one allowed next event is event4.
- Therefore there is a path 9 → 3 → 4, so event4 does eventually happen. Thus C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 states: if C1 holds (i.e., event4 eventually happens) then event4 happens.
- This is a direct logical implication of C1 (C1 asserting exactly that event4 happens eventually), so the implication is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. 

- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""  
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every next state, event4 occurs).

Given the context: the initial event is event6. The allowed immediate successors after event6 are {event1, event2, event5, event7, event8, event9}. Event4 is not among these. That means the next state after the initial event6 can be one where event4 does not happen (for example, event1). So C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state, and therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" C2: ""C1 always holds.""
- Initially event6 occurred. The rules for transitions after event6 allow only events {1,2,5,7,8,9} next — event4 is not among them.
- Because immediately after the initial state a next state where event4 occurs is not allowed, C1 is false at that point.
- Since C1 fails in at least one reachable step, the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event6 happened.
- From event6 the allowed next events are {event1, event2, event5, event7, event8, event9} (given).
- Event4 is not among those immediate successors of event6, so ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (C1) is not guaranteed.
- Therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 occurred.
- The rules say: after event4, the next event must be either event2 or event8 (this transition appears multiple times but never includes event4).
- Therefore event4 cannot happen in the very next state, so C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false for the initial step.
- Since C1 is not even true for that reachable situation, the claim C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""  
C2: ""C1 always holds.""

Step-by-step:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, either event2, or event8 must happen."" (appearing multiple times) governs the immediate next state.
- Therefore the immediate next event must be either event2 or event8 — event4 cannot occur in the next state.

Thus C1 is false in the given system, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state, the next-state event must be event4.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules:
- After event4, the next event is either event2 or event8 (not event4).
  (Explicit rule: ""After event4, either event2, or event8 must happen."")

Step 3 — counterexample:
- Initially event4 happened; from that state the next event can be event2 or event8. So the next state need not be event4. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed in that case.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") to be true. C1 is ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible future from the initial state).

From the context we have transitions:
- 7 -> {1,2,5,6}
- 1 -> {2,3,6,7,8}
- (other transitions exist but are not needed)

Starting at the initial event7, pick the successor 1, then from 1 pick successor 7, and repeat: 7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → ... This infinite trace never visits event4 (nor event3). Therefore event4 is not guaranteed to occur, so C1 is false. Since C2 requires C1 to hold (and also event3 to happen), C2 is also false.

Answer: False
---
We are given transition rules and the initial event7. C1 asserts ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., every possible future sequence will at some point include event4). C2 asserts ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" (a conjunction), so C2 can only be true if C1 is true.

From event7 we can choose the following transitions: 7 -> 1 (allowed). From 1 we can go to 2 (allowed). From 2 we can go back to 1 (allowed). Thus there is an infinite path 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that never reaches event4. Because such a path exists, event4 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible sequence, so C1 is false.

Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is also false (regardless of whether event3 can occur on some paths).

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the rules, after initial event7 you can go to event6, and from event6 you can go back to event7. Thus the infinite loop 7 → 6 → 7 → 6 → ... is allowed.
- This loop never visits event4, so ""Event4 always happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed — C1 is false.
- The same loop also never visits event3, so ""Event3 happens"" is not guaranteed.
- C2 requires both C1 and ""Event3 happens"", so C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initial event6 happened.
- From event6 one allowed next is event2.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5 one allowed next is event2 (among others).
- So there is a valid infinite trace 6 → 2 → 5 → 2 → 5 → ... that never includes event1 or event4.

Thus C1 (event4 and event1 happen) does not always hold, so C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning briefly:
- C1 = ""Event4 happens and event1 happens."" C2 = ""C1 always holds"" means in every possible future sequence both event4 and event1 must occur.
- From the rules, initial event is 6 and transitions allow nondeterministic choices. There exists a legal infinite path that never visits event1 or event4, for example:
  6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> ... 
  (6 → 9 is allowed; 9 → 8 is allowed; 8 → 3 is allowed; 3 → 6 is allowed.)
- That path never includes event1 or event4, so C1 does not hold on that run. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to hold always.

Final answer: False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 = ""Event4 happens and event1 happens."" C2 = ""C1 always holds"" means in every possible sequence starting from the initial event, both event1 and event4 must occur.
- Start is event6. After event6 one allowed next event is event9 (6 -> 9).
- After event9 allowed next events include event7 (9 -> 7).
- After event7 allowed next events include event8 (7 -> 8).
- After event8 allowed next events include event6 (8 -> 6).
- So the cycle 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 is valid and can repeat indefinitely. This infinite trace never includes event1 or event4.
- Because there exists at least one valid execution in which event1 and event4 never occur, C1 does not always hold.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Counterexample (infinite run that respects the rules but avoids C2):

- Start: event2 (given).
- From event2 choose event3 (allowed: 1,3,5,8,9).
- From event3 choose event6 (allowed: 6,7,9).
- From event6 choose event4 (allowed: 4,5).
- From event4 choose event2 (allowed: 2,5,6).

We are back at event2 and can repeat the same choices forever: 2 → 3 → 6 → 4 → 2 → ...

This cycle never produces event9, never produces event1, and never produces event5. Therefore neither ""event9 happens"" nor ""event5 and event1 happen"" ever becomes true on this execution. Hence C2 is not guaranteed, so the answer is False.
---
We want to know if, given the rules and the initial event2, it must be the case that (event9 occurs) or (both event5 and event1 occur).

Transitions (condensed):
- 2 -> {1,3,5,8,9}
- 3 -> {6,7,9}
- 6 -> {4,5}
- 4 -> {2,5,6}
- 7 -> {2,5}
- 8 -> {1,4,5}
- 1 -> {6,7,8}
- 5 -> {2,6,7,8}
- 9 -> {3,7}

Counterexample path from the initial event2 that avoids event9, event5, and event1:
2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 6 -> ...

All successive moves are allowed by the rules (3→6, 6→4, 4→6), and this loop never visits event1, event5, or event9. Therefore neither event9 occurs nor do both event5 and event1 occur on that run, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
True

Reasoning (concise):
- Start: event2 happened.
- C2 is ""event9 happens OR (event5 and event1 happen)"".
- Direct way: from event2 one allowed next event is event9, so there is a valid sequence where event9 happens; that makes C2 true.
- Alternatively, another valid sequence is event2 -> event5 -> event2 -> event1, which gives both event5 and event1 (satisfying C1), so C2 holds that way as well.

Therefore C2 can be satisfied, so True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We start in the state after event5. From the rules:
- After event5 the possible next events are {3,7,9}.
- After event7 the possible next events are {1,4,5,8} (so 4 is an available next event).

Thus there is a concrete path: 5 -> 7 -> 4. At the state where event7 has just occurred, the next event can be event4, so C1 holds at that state. Since that state is reachable from the initial state, C1 eventually holds. Therefore C2 is True.

True
---

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 occurs. From event5 the next event can be event3, event7, or event9.
- If we pick event7 (or event9) at the next step, then from event7 (and from event9) event4 is allowed as the following event.
- So a valid sequence is 5 -> 7 -> 4 (or 5 -> 9 -> 4). At the state where event7 (or event9) holds, the proposition ""event4 happens in the next state"" (C1) is true.
- Therefore there exists a future state where C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True."

Votes: {'True': 2, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event7 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point there is a state whose immediate successor is event7 (in particular it is enough that it happens immediately).

Step 2 — examine transitions from the initial state
- The initial event is event9.
- The rules say: after event9, the next event may be one of {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}. In particular, event7 is an allowed successor of event9.

Step 3 — conclude
- From the initial state (event9) we can take a transition to event7 in the next step, so C1 can hold immediately. Therefore C1 does eventually hold.

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event9 occurs.
- The transition rule after event9 allows {event1, event2, event4, event5, event7, event8} next.
- Therefore the very next state can be event7, so C1 (event7 in the next state) can hold immediately.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
---
We ask whether ""C1 eventually holds"" is guaranteed from the given rules (i.e., whether event7 must occur at some future step).

1. Initial state: event9 happened.
2. Relevant successors (deduplicated from the context):
   - 9 → {1,2,4,5,7,8}
   - 1 → {8,9}
   - 8 → {2,4,6,9}
   - 2 → {3,4,5,6,7}
   - 3 → {1,4,6,8,9}
   - 4 → {2,3,7,8}
   - 5 → {2,3,6}
   - 6 → {2,3,7,8,9}
   - 7 → {1,2,3,5,8,9}
3. From 9 we can choose successors that avoid 7. For example, the cycle
   9 → 1 → 8 → 2 → 3 → 1
   is valid because each step is allowed by the rules and none of those nodes is 7.
4. That cycle can be repeated indefinitely, so there exists an infinite run from the initial state that never visits event7.
5. Therefore it is not guaranteed that C1 (event7 in the next state) will eventually become true. C2 is not entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 says ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. C2 asserts that event4 does happen. We must decide whether event4 must happen given the rules.

From the initial event7 we can avoid event4 by choosing other successors. For example:
7 -> 1 (allowed), then 1 -> 6 (the only non-4 option), then 6 -> 2, and 2 -> 1. This yields the cycle 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 ... which never visits event4. Therefore it is possible for event4 to never occur, so C1 (event4 does not happen) can hold. Hence C2 (C1 does not hold) is false.

Final answer: False
---

---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" (i.e., event4 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. event4 does happen.

So C2 is claiming that event4 must occur.

Step 2 — examine transitions and look for a counterexample (a possible infinite sequence starting from the initial event7 that never uses event4).

Relevant transitions (condensed):
- 7 -> {1,3,4,5,6,8,9}
- 1 -> {4,6}
- 6 -> {2,5,9}
- 9 -> {1,4}
- 5 -> {1,6,8}
- 2 -> {1,3,4,7,8}
- 3 -> {2,4,6,8}
- 8 -> {1,3,6,9}
- 4 -> {1,2,3,8}

Step 3 — construct a path that avoids event4 forever:
- From the initial 7, pick 6 (allowed).
- 6 -> 9 (allowed).
- 9 -> 1 (allowed; avoids 4).
- 1 -> 6 (must choose 6 to avoid 4).
This gives the cycle 6 -> 9 -> 1 -> 6 repeating indefinitely, and it never includes event4.

Therefore there exists a valid run starting at event7 in which event4 never happens. So C1 can hold, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed and is false as a logical consequence.

Final answer:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (an implication P → P)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine C1:
- An implication of the form P → P is always true (a tautology) in classical logic: if the antecedent holds, the consequent is the same, so the implication holds; if the antecedent doesn't hold, the implication is still true (vacuously). Thus C1 holds.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens,"" which is a tautology (P → P) and therefore always true.
- C2 asserts the negation of C1 (""C1 does not hold""), so C2 is false.
---
C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That is a tautology (p → p) and is always true (and in fact true here because event2 does happen initially). Therefore the claim C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event9 occurs.
- From the rules: after event9 the next event must be one of {event5, event6, event7}.
- Each of event5, event6, and event7 allows event1 as a possible next event (after event5: {event1,...}, after event6: {event1,...}, after event7: {event1,...}).
- Therefore there is a valid execution 9 -> 5 -> 1 (or 9 -> 6 -> 1, or 9 -> 7 -> 1) in which, at the state where event5 (or 6 or 7) holds, C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is true.
- Thus C1 becomes true at some future time, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The initial event is event9.
- From event9 the allowed next events are {event5, event6, event7}.
- Each of event5, event6, and event7 allows event1 as a possible next event (their successor sets include event1).
- So we can take a path 9 -> 5 -> 1 (or 9 -> 6 -> 1, or 9 -> 7 -> 1). On the intermediate state (after 5, 6, or 7) the proposition C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") can be made true by choosing event1 next.
- Therefore there exists a future state where C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning in brief:
- Initially event8 happened, so the ""event8 happens"" part of C2 is true.
- C1 requires that event9 must happen on every possible continuation. From the rules: after event8 we may go to event2; after event2 we may go to event1; after event1 we may go back to event2. So there is a valid infinite trace 8 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... that never includes event9.
- Because such a 1–2 loop avoids event9 indefinitely, event9 is not guaranteed to always happen, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (event8 happens AND C1 holds) is false.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context, the system starts with event8.
- From event8 you can go to event2 (8 → 2).
- From event2 you can go to event1 (2 → 1).
- From event1 you can go to event3 (1 → 3).
- From event3 you can go back to event1 (3 → 1).

Thus there is a reachable cycle 1 → 3 → 1 ... that never includes event9. Therefore event9 is not guaranteed to occur in all possible futures (C1 is false). C2 requires C1 to hold (and event8 to happen); since C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Goal C2 requires both (a) event8 happens and (b) event9 always happens (C1).
- The context states initially event8 happened, so (a) is true.
- For (b) to be true, every possible future sequence must eventually include event9. We only need one valid counterexample path that avoids event9 forever to show C1 is false.
- From event8 we may choose event2 (8 -> 2). From event2 we may choose event1 (2 -> 1). From event1 we may choose event2 (1 -> 2). This gives the infinite loop 8 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... which never visits event9, and every step respects the allowed transitions.
- Therefore event9 is not inevitable (C1 is false), so C2 (event8 happened and C1 holds) is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event7 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate successor event is 7).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future step there is a state whose next event is 7).

Step 2 — examine conditions and trace:
- Initial event is event3.
- The rules say: after event3, one possible next event is event7 (successors of 3 include 7).

Step 3 — conclusion:
- From the initial state (event3) we can immediately take the successor event7, so C1 can hold in the very next state. Therefore C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is satisfied.

Answer: True
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning summary:
- C1 = ""event7 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate next event is 7).
- From the initial state event3, event7 is one possible next event but not mandatory (after event3 the next may be 1,2,4,5,7,8,or9).
- C2 asks that at some future point C1 holds (i.e., at some time the immediate next event is 7). For C2 to be true under universal/inevitability reading, every possible run must eventually hit a transition whose target is 7.
- There is a counterexample infinite run that never goes to 7: 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → ... . Each transition is allowed by the rules (3→1, 1→4, 4→3), and no transition ever goes to 7.
- Because such a run exists that avoids any next-state = 7 forever, C2 (that C1 eventually holds inevitably) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
The hypothesis C2 requires that event7 and event6 both happen (C2 is equivalent to ""event7 and event6"").

We start with event7 (given). After event7, event5 must happen (rule: after event7, event5 must happen). After event5, one of {event1, event2, event3, event9} must happen. To show C2 is not guaranteed, it suffices to exhibit a valid continuation that never produces event6:

- 7 -> 5 (forced)
- 5 -> 3 (allowed)
- 3 -> 9 (allowed: after event3, one of {1,4,9})
- 9 -> 7 (allowed: after event9, one of {2,4,7})

This returns to 7 and can repeat indefinitely: 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 9 -> 7 -> ... At no point in this cycle is event6 required, so event6 need not occur.

Because there exists a legal sequence starting from the initial event7 that never produces event6, event6 is not entailed by the rules. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, and C2 (which requires C1) is False.

Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 happens, so the part “event7 happens” in C1/C2 is satisfied.
- From event7 we must have event5.
- From event5 we may choose event2 (the rules are nondeterministic: “either … must happen”).
- From event2 we may choose event9.
- From event9 we may choose event7, which forces event5 again. This yields a cycle 7 → 5 → 2 → 9 → 7 … that never visits event6.
- Event6 can occur only after event1 or event4, but those are avoidable choices (e.g., by always picking the cycle above).
- Therefore event6 is not guaranteed, so C1 (“event7 and event6”) need not hold, and C2 (C1 and event7) is not entailed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C2 says C1 holds and event7 happens. C1 is ""event7 and event6"", so C2 is equivalent to ""event7 and event6"" (event7 duplicated).
2. The context gives event7 initially, so event7 does happen.
3. Nothing in the rules forces event6 to occur — it only appears as an optional successor of event1 and event4. All successors are nondeterministic (""either ... must happen""), so we can choose other successors to avoid event6.
4. A concrete counterexample path avoiding event6: event7 (initial) -> event5 (must after 7) -> event2 (choose from 5) -> event1 (choose from 2) -> event2 (choose from 1) -> ... looping between 1 and 2 forever. This sequence never produces event6.
5. Because event6 is not guaranteed, C2 (which requires event6) is not entailed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 = (event6 happens) or (event8 happens). C2 = (event2 happens) or C1.
- From the rules, after event9 (the initial event) one of {4,7,8} must occur.
- To disprove C2 it suffices to exhibit a valid infinite (or cyclic) sequence starting at 9 that never contains event2, event6, or event8.
- Consider this valid cycle of allowed choices:
  9 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...
  Check transitions:
  - 9 can go to 4 (allowed).
  - 4 can go to 1 (allowed).
  - 1 can go to 3 (allowed).
  - 3 can go to 9 (allowed).
  None of the events in this cycle are 2, 6, or 8.
- Because the rules allow nondeterministic choices, this sequence is permitted, and along it neither event2 nor event6 nor event8 ever happens. Hence C2 is not guaranteed; it is false.
---
C2 asserts: (event2) or (event6 or event8) — equivalently, that at some point one of {2,6,8} occurs.

We can show this is not guaranteed. Starting from event9, choose the following allowed successors so as to avoid 2,6,8:

9 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... 

Check transitions:
- 9 can go to 7.
- 7 can go to 1.
- 1 can go to 3.
- 3 can go to 7.

All these choices are permitted by the rules, and none of the events 2, 6, or 8 appears in this infinite cycle. Therefore it is possible to follow the rules forever without ever realizing event2, event6, or event8. Hence C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reason: Starting from event9, choose event4, then event1, then event3, then event7, then back to event1, etc. The cycle 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 is allowed by the rules and never includes event2, event6, or event8. Thus it is possible that neither event6 nor event8 (C1) ever happens and event2 never happens, so C2 is not guaranteed."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Hypothesis C1 asserts: “event5 happens and event8 happens.”
- C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds (i.e., both event5 and event8 will occur at some points).
- From the context the initial event is event6. After event6 one of {event1, event4, event5} must occur.
- There is a valid infinite trace that prevents event8 from ever occurring while still respecting the rules: choose event5 after event6, then choose event7 after event5, then event5 after event7, and repeat: 6 → 5 → 7 → 5 → 7 → ...
  - This trace is allowed because after 6 one may pick 5; after 5 one may pick 7; after 7 one may pick 5.
  - Along this trace event5 occurs (so half of C1 happens) but event8 never occurs.
- Because there exists a permitted behavior in which event8 never happens, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold in all runs. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 is ""Event5 happens and event8 happens."" C2 states that C1 eventually holds (i.e., there is a possible future in which both events occur).
- From the context: initially event6 happened. After event6 one possible next event is event5 (rules: after event6 -> {event1, event4, event5}).
- After event5 one possible next event is event1 (rules: after event5 -> {event1, event2, event3, event7}).
- After event1 one possible next event is event8 (rules: after event1 -> {event4, event5, event6, event7, event8, event9}).
- Thus the sequence 6 → 5 → 1 → 8 is allowed, in which both event5 and event8 occur.
- Therefore there exists a possible execution where C1 holds, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 we can go to event5 (after event6, either event1, event4, or event5 must happen).
- From event5 we can go to event1 (after event5, either event1, event2, event3, or event7 must happen).
- From event1 we can go to event8 (after event1, either event4, event5, event6, event7, event8, or event9 must happen).

Thus the sequence 6 → 5 → 1 → 8 is allowed, so both event5 and event8 occur. Therefore C2 is True."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- Hypothesis asks whether C1 (""Event5 eventually happens"") always holds (C2) from the initial condition (event9 happened).
- From the transition rules: 9 -> {3,4,7,8}, 3 -> {1,2,4,5,6,7,8}, and 1 -> {3,4,8}.
- There is a valid infinite run avoiding event5: 9 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... (since 9->3, 3->1 and 1->3 are all allowed). This run never visits event5.
- Because at least one allowed execution never reaches event5, ""event5 eventually happens"" does not hold on all runs.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Build the transition graph from the rules. From event9 you may go to {3,4,7,8}. From event3 you may go to {1,2,4,5,6,7,8}. From event1 you may go to {3,4,8}. (Other rules exist but these suffice.)
- Starting at the initial event9, choose 9 -> 3 (allowed). From 3 choose 3 -> 1 (allowed). From 1 choose 1 -> 3 (allowed). This yields the infinite path 9,3,1,3,1,3,... which never visits event5.
- Because there exists a valid execution that never reaches event5, ""event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed on all executions. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From event9 (initial), one allowed next is event3.
- From event3, one allowed next is event2.
- From event2, one allowed next is event9.
- Thus there is a cycle 9 → 3 → 2 → 9 that never visits event5.
- Because a run exists that avoids event5 forever, ""event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed on all runs. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event9 happens, so a next state can be event5 (since after event9 one option is event5).
- C1 asserts: ""If event5 happens, then event2 happens"" — i.e., from a state where event5 occurs, the next event must be event2.
- But the transitions after event5 are {event3, event4, event7, event9} — event2 is not allowed after event5, so C1 is false in a state where event5 occurs.
- Because a next state of the initial state can be event5, C1 does not hold in that next state. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 states: ""If event5 happens, then event2 happens"" — i.e., immediately after event5 the only allowed next event must be event2.
2. From the context, the rule after event5 is: ""either event3, event4, event7, or event9 must happen."" Event2 is not among these options.
3. Therefore there are allowed sequences where event5 is followed by an event that is not event2 (for example, event5 → event3), so C1 is false in any state.
4. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Thus C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is the proposition ""If event5 happens, then event2 happens"" (a material implication about the same state).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in every possible successor state after the initial event9).
- From the context, after event9 the possible next events are {event2, event4, event5, event7, event8}.
- Check C1 in each successor:
  - If the next event is 2,4,7, or 8 then event5 is false, so C1 is vacuously true.
  - If the next event is 5 then event5 is true but event2 is not true in that same state, so C1 is false there.
- Because there is a possible next state (when event5 occurs) where C1 is false, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"" universally) is False."

We need to decide whether there exists a run (sequence of allowed events starting from the initial event1) that at some point has the next-state event equal to event7 (i.e., eventually C1 holds).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- From event1, the allowed next events are {4,5,6,8,9} (so event4 is reachable in one step).
- From event4, the allowed next events are {1,2,3,6,7} — in particular event7 is an allowed next event.
- Therefore there is a valid run 1 -> 4 -> 7. At the time we are at event4, the next state is event7, so C1 holds at that point.
- Hence there exists a run where sometime C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event7 occurs.
- From 7 you can go to 2 (choice avoiding 1).
- 2 can go to 5 (avoiding 1).
- 5 can go to 4.
- 4 can go back to 2.
- This yields the cycle 7 → 2 → 5 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 4 → ... which never includes event1 and is allowed by the given rules.

Because there exists an infinite execution starting from the initial state that never reaches event1, ""Event1 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed in all executions. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""event1 eventually happens on every possible execution"") is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret the transitions as a directed graph (edges show allowed next events). Start node is event7.

Step 2 — ask whether every path from 7 must eventually hit node 1. If there exists a path that never visits 1, C2 is false.

Step 3 — find a counterexample path that avoids 1 forever. From the given transitions:
- 7 -> 2 is allowed.
- 2 -> 6 is allowed.
- 6 -> 4 is allowed.
- 4 -> 2 is allowed.

Thus 7 -> 2 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 4 -> ... is a valid infinite path that never visits event1.

Conclusion: There is a valid execution from the initial state that never reaches event1, so C1 is not guaranteed on all paths. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need C2 = (C1 holds and event1 happens). C1 is ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., every possible continuation from the initial event must at some point produce event3).

From the rules: 6 -> {1,4,5}, 1 -> {4,5,9}, 4 -> {1,3,7,9}, etc. Starting at the given initial event6, there is a valid continuation 6 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... that repeats the 1–4 cycle forever and never visits event3. Because such a continuation exists, event3 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible run, so C1 is false. Therefore the conjunction C2 (C1 and event1) is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning summary:
- C1 claims ""event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible sequence). From the rules, after event6 (the initial event) one can choose event1; after event1 choose event9; after event9 choose event6 — giving the infinite cycle 6 → 1 → 9 → 6 → ...
- This cycle never visits event3, so event3 is not guaranteed to occur. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and event1 to happen). Even though event1 does occur in the cycle, C1 fails, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — understand the claim:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible future sequence starting from the initial state, event3 will occur).
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens.

Step 2 — extract transitions (from the context):
- 1 -> {4,5,9}
- 2 -> {1,3,5,7,8}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,8}
- 4 -> {1,3,7,9}
- 5 -> {3,7,8}
- 6 -> {1,4,5}  (initial event is 6)
- 7 -> {2,3,4,6,9}
- 8 -> {2,3,4,7}
- 9 -> {1,2,6,7,8}

Step 3 — find a counterexample to ""event3 always happens"":
- From the initial event6, choose event1 next (6 -> 1).
- From event1 choose event4 (1 -> 4).
- From event4 choose event1 (4 -> 1).
This yields the infinite loop 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... which never visits event3. Therefore event3 does not always happen.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C1 is false (we just showed a path avoiding event3), so ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" is false regardless of whether event1 can happen on some paths.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened, so the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event8}.
- C2 asserts that in that next state C1 holds; C1 says ""event6 happens in the next state"" (i.e., two steps from the initial state).
- But if the immediate next event is event1 (allowed by the rule after event4), then from event1 the next event must be one of {event5, event7, event9} — event6 cannot occur there. So C1 would be false in that next state.
- Because there is an allowed choice (event1) that makes C1 false in the next state, C2 is not guaranteed; therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened, so the next state (call it S1) must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event8}.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; equivalently, in every possible S1, the subsequent state (S2) must have event6.
- Check S1 = event1: after event1 the allowed next events are {event5, event7, event9}. Event6 is not among them, so C1 (that event6 happens in the next state) is false in that S1.
- Because there is at least one possible next state (S1 = event1) where C1 does not hold, C2 is false.
---
C1: ""Event6 happens in the next state.""
C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. from the initial state, in the next state it is true that event6 will happen in the following state (so C2 asserts event6 happens two steps from the initial state).

From the context: initially event4. After event4 the next event can be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event8}. Take the possible next event = event1 (allowed). After event1 the following event must be one of {event5, event7, event9} — none is event6. So in that branch, in the next state C1 (""event6 happens in the next state"") is false. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed; it is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 states ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., at every step from some point onward, the current event is event9).
- Check the transition rule for event9: after event9 the next event must be one of {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Event9 → event9 is not allowed.
- Therefore it is impossible to have two consecutive event9 occurrences, so you cannot have a suffix of the execution where every position is event9. Hence C1 is never satisfied.
- C2 says ""eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., there is a point after which C1 is true). Since C1 can never be true, C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 (""Event9 always happens"") would require that whenever an event occurs from some point onward it is event9 every time.
- But the transition rules show that after event9 the possible next events are {2,3,5,6,7,8} — event9 is not among them. So two consecutive event9 occurrences are impossible, and no state has only event9 as a successor.
- Therefore C1 can never be true at any point, so it cannot eventually hold. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 means ""event9 holds at every future step"" (event9 always happens).
- For C1 to ever hold from some time onward, it must be possible to have event9 followed by event9 (so that once you reach event9, all subsequent steps can remain event9).
- But the rules for after event9 list only {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, event8} — event9 is not allowed to follow event9.
- Thus you can never have two consecutive event9 occurrences, so there is no time after which every future event is event9. Therefore C1 never becomes true, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- From the initial event7, the possible next events are {3,4,5,6,9}. Event2 is not among these, so C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is false now.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., from the current state, after one transition, the successor state would have event2 as its next event). But some successors of 7 (e.g. event3) have possible next events {1,5,7,9}, which do not include 2. Thus C1 does not hold in all next states, so C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at state1).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — so C2 asserts that at state1, Event2 will happen at the following state (state2). Equivalently, C2 claims Event2 occurs at state2.

From the context:
- Initially event7 happened, so state0 = 7.
- After event7 the next state (state1) must be one of {3,4,5,6,9}. So state1 could be 3.
- After event3 the following state (state2) must be one of {1,5,7,9} — this set does not include 2.

Thus there is a valid evolution 7 -> 3 -> 1 (for example) in which Event2 does not occur at state2. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (is false).
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., O(event2)).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., O(O(event2))) — equivalently, two steps ahead event2 occurs from the initial state.
- Initially event7 happened. From event7 the next event must be one of {3,4,5,6,9}.
- Consider the possible next state event3: after event3 the next event must be one of {1,5,7,9} — event2 is not allowed there. So in the successor state event3, C1 (that event2 happens next) does not hold.
- Because there exists an allowed immediate successor (event3) where C1 is false, C2 is not true in the initial state.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- Start: event1 happens, and event1 → event8.
- From event8 choose event6 (allowed). From event6 choose event4 (allowed). From event4 choose event5 (allowed). So event5 does occur.
- After event5 you may choose event6, then event4, then event5 again (5 → 6 → 4 → 5), forming a cycle that never includes event3.
- Since there is a valid execution where event5 happens but event3 never happens, the implication ""if C1 then event3 happens"" is not guaranteed.
---
We ask whether ""If event5 eventually happens (C1), then event3 must happen"" (C2).

Relevant transitions:
- After event5: either event6 or event9.
- After event6: either event1, event2, event4, event5, or event8.
- (Also note 1→8, 8→{1,2,6,9}, 2→{3,4,5,7,9}, etc.)

Counterexample (a valid run where 5 occurs but 3 never does):
- Start: event1 → event8 → event2 → event5 (so C1 holds).
- Then choose event6 (from 5), then from 6 choose event5, and repeat: 5 → 6 → 5 → 6 → ...
This infinite loop is allowed by the transitions and never includes event3.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed. Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- From initial event1 we must go to 8 (1 -> 8).
- From 8 we can go to 2 (8 -> 2), and from 2 we can go to 5 (2 -> 5). So event5 can indeed happen (C1 can hold).
- After 5 choose 6 (5 -> 6), then choose 1 (6 -> 1), and from 1 → 8 and from 8 → 1 repeatedly. This yields the infinite loop 5,6,1,8,1,8,... which never visits event3.
- Hence there exists a run where event5 occurs but event3 never occurs, so ""If C1 holds then event3 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reason: from the initial event6 we may repeatedly follow 6 → 2 → 6 → 2 → ... (allowed because after 6 one option is 2, and after 2 one option is 6). This infinite trace never produces event5, event8, or event9, so the conjunction ""event5 happens and (event9 and event8 happen)"" is not guaranteed by the given rules.
---
We ask whether C2 (""event5 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 = ""event9 happens and event8 happens"") is entailed by the context given initial event6.

Counterexample (valid trace under the rules) showing C2 need not hold:
- Start: event6 (given).
- Choose event2 next (allowed after 6).
- From event2 choose event6 (allowed after 2).
- Repeat 6 → 2 → 6 → 2 … indefinitely.

This infinite (or arbitrarily long finite) valid sequence obeys all ""after X, one of … must happen"" constraints but never produces event5, event8, or event9. Thus event5 and C1 are not forced by the context.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
The hypothesis (C2) asserts that event5 happens and C1 holds; C1 asserts events9 and 8 happen. So C2 requires events 5, 9, and 8 to occur in some valid sequence starting from the initial event6.

Relevant transitions (from the context):
- After event6: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- After event5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- After event9: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Starting from the initial event6, choose the allowed next event5 (6 -> 5). From event5 we can go to event9 (5 -> 9). From event9 we can go to event8 (9 -> 8). That yields the sequence 6 -> 5 -> 9 -> 8, which is allowed by the rules and contains events 5, 9, and 8.

Therefore C2 can be satisfied. Final answer: True"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether the rule C1 (""If event8 happens, then event5 happens"") holds in all allowed sequences (C2).

Interpretation: from the given transition rules, after any occurrence of event8 the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event5, event6}. C1 asserts that event5 must occur (presumably at some next step / along the allowed continuation) whenever event8 occurs. To disprove ""always"", it suffices to find one legal infinite path in which event8 occurs but event5 never does.

From the rules (showing only relevant outgoing choices):

- After event4: {1,5,6,7,8}
- After event8: {1,3,5,6}
- After event1: {2,5,7}
- After event2: {4,6,8,9}
- After event4: {1,5,6,7,8} (repeats)
(others also exist but not needed)

Construct a legal cycle avoiding event5:
- Start with the given initial event4.
- Choose event8 next (allowed: 4 -> 8).
- From 8, choose event1 (8 -> 1 is allowed).
- From 1, choose event2 (1 -> 2 is allowed).
- From 2, choose event8 (2 -> 8 is allowed).

This gives the loop: 4 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> ... which is entirely allowed by the rules and never includes event5. Thus event8 can occur while event5 never occurs.

Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer:
False
---
You claim C1: ""If event8 happens, then event5 happens."" and C2: ""C1 always holds.""

Look at the given rule for event8: ""After event8, either event1, event3, event5, or event6 must happen."" That explicitly allows event1, event3, or event6 instead of event5. A simple counterexample suffices:

- Start: event4 (given).
- From event4 we may choose event8 (allowed).
- From event8 we may choose event1 (allowed).

Here event8 occurred but was followed by event1, not event5, so C1 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning in steps:
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event8 happens, then event5 happens"" (interpreted as: whenever event8 occurs, event5 must occur at some later point).
- From the rules: 4 -> {1,5,6,7,8}, 8 -> {1,3,5,6}, 1 -> {2,5,7}, 2 -> {4,6,8,9}, etc.
- A counterexample path starting at the initial event4 that contains event8 but never contains event5:
  4 -> 8 (allowed), 8 -> 1 (allowed), 1 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 4 (allowed), then repeat 4 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 ...
- This infinite cycle visits event8 but never event5, so event8 does not force event5.
Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event3 or Event5 happens"") must be true given the rules and that event6 happened initially.

From event6 the allowed next events are {1,2,3,5}. To show C2 is not guaranteed, it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence that never produces event2, event3, or event5 (so neither Event2 nor C1 ever holds).

One such valid infinite cycle:
- Start: 6 (given).
- From 6 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 7 (allowed).
- From 7 choose 4 (allowed).
- From 4 choose 6 (allowed).
- Repeat: 6 → 1 → 7 → 4 → 6 → ...

All choices at each step are permitted by the rules, and this cycle never includes event2, event3, or event5. Therefore C2 need not hold in all possible executions.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event3 or event5"".
- C2 is ""event2 or C1"", i.e. equivalently ""event2 or event3 or event5"".
- We need to check whether, given the rules and initial event6, C2 must be true in every possible evolution.

Counterexample (a valid evolution that avoids event2, event3, and event5):
- Start: event6 (given).
- After event6 we may choose event1 (allowed: after 6 → {1,2,3,5}).
- After event1 we may choose event9 (allowed: after 1 → {2,7,9}).
- After event9 we may choose event1 (allowed: after 9 → {1,2,3,6,7}).
- Repeat 1 → 9 → 1 → 9 ... forever.

In that infinite run no event2, event3, or event5 ever occurs, so C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (counterexample path):
- Start: event6 happens.
- From event6 we may choose event1 (rule: after 6 → {1,2,3,5}).
- From event1 we may choose event9 (rule: after 1 → {2,7,9}).
- From event9 we may choose event1 again (rule: after 9 → {1,2,3,6,7}).

This yields an infinite loop 6 → 1 → 9 → 1 → 9 → ... that never produces event2, event3, or event5. Hence C1 (3 or 5) is false on this run and event2 does not occur, so C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify start and goal:
- Start: event5 happened initially.
- Goal (C1): both event7 and event3 happen (in some order). C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds (i.e., there is a possible sequence from the start that includes both 7 and 3).

Step 2 — extract transitions (edges):
- 5 -> {2, 7, 9}
- 7 -> {2}
- 2 -> {1, 6, 8, 9}
- 8 -> {2, 3, 4, 9}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
(and others exist but these are sufficient)

Step 3 — find a path that visits both 7 and 3:
- From 5 choose 7: 5 -> 7 (so 7 happens).
- From 7 forced to 2: 7 -> 2.
- From 2 choose 8: 2 -> 8.
- From 8 choose 3: 8 -> 3 (so 3 happens).

Thus the sequence 5 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3 visits both 7 and 3.

Conclusion: C1 can occur, so C2 is True.

True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: event5 happens initially. From event5 we may go to event2, event7, or event9.
- To show C2 is false it is enough to exhibit a valid infinite run from the initial state that never reaches a state where both event7 and event3 have occurred.
- Construct this run:
  - 5 -> 7 (allowed: after 5, event7 is an option)
  - 7 -> 2 (forced: after 7, event2 must happen)
  - 2 -> 1 (allowed: after 2, event1 is an option)
  - 1 -> 7 (allowed: after 1, event7 is an option)
  - Repeat 7 -> 2 -> 1 -> 7 -> ...
- This loop is allowed by the transition rules and never yields event3. It contains event7 repeatedly but never event3, so ""event7 and event3 happen"" never becomes true on this run.
- Therefore C1 does not inevitably eventually hold from the initial state, so the statement ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is False.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event5 happens (given).
- From event5 we may go to event7 (after event5 either event2, event7, or event9 must happen) — take event7 next.
- After event7, event2 must happen.
- From event2 we can go to event6 (after event2 either event1, event6, event8, or event9 must happen) — take event6.
- From event6 we can go to event3 (after event6 either event1, event3, event4, or event5 must happen) — take event3.

This trace 5 → 7 → 2 → 6 → 3 contains both event7 and event3 (7 occurs earlier, 3 occurs later). Thus C1 (event7 happens and event3 happens) eventually holds along this trace, so C2 is True."

- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., the next event must be either event6 or event3).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 is True or False.

- C1: ""Event7 happens in the next state."" The system initially has event3. The rules for ""after event3"" state the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event6}. Event7 is not among these, so C1 is False.

- C2: ""Event7 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is False, C2 cannot be True.

Final answer: False
---
Initial: event3 happened.

From the rules: after event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5, event6}. Event7 is not among these, so event7 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false, and C2 (""Event7 happens and C1 holds"") is also false.

False
---
Step 1 — What is asked
- C1: ""Event7 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the current state).
- C2: ""Event7 happens and C1 holds"" — this requires that event7 occurs in the next state (so C1) and event7 happens (same requirement), so C2 is true exactly when event7 occurs in the next state.

Step 2 — Start and allowed next events
- The initial event is event3.
- The rules for ""After event3"" list the allowed next events: event1, event2, event4, event5, or event6.
- Event7 is not among the allowed next events after event3.

Step 3 — Conclusion
- Since the next state after the initial event3 cannot be event7, C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

Final answer:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: Initially event7 happened. The rules say that after event7 one of {event2, event3, event4, event6, event8, event9} must happen. C1 is ""event6 or event2 happens."" That is not guaranteed in the next state because the next event could instead be event3, event4, event8, or event9. Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C1: ""Event6 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e., the current state is event6 or event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., the very next event must be event6 or event2.

Step 2 — use the given transitions from the initial state
- Initially event7 happened.
- After event7, an allowed next event is one of {event2, event3, event4, event6, event8, event9}.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Although event2 and event6 are allowed next, there are also allowed next events (e.g., event3) that are not event2 or event6.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state. A valid counterexample: choose next = event3 (permitted), then C1 is false in that next state.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning: initially event7 occurred. From the rules ""After event7, either event2, event3, event4, event6, event8, or event9 must happen."" The next state could be event3, event4, event8, or event9 (not only event2 or event6). C1 (""event6 happens or event2 happens"") is therefore not guaranteed in the next state, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happened. C1 states ""event1 happens or event4 happens."" At that initial moment, event3 occurred, so C1 is already not true there.
- Even if one interpreted C1 as an eventual occurrence, it is not guaranteed: after event3 the allowed next events include event5 (as well as 1,4,6). If we choose event5, then after event5 the allowed next events include event3. So we can follow the infinite loop 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... which never includes event1 or event4.
- Thus there are reachable moments (in fact the initial moment and an entire infinite run) where neither event1 nor event4 occurs. Therefore ""C1 always holds"" is false.
---
C1 says: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens.""  
C2 says: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every point in the sequence, either event1 or event4 happens).

But the initial event is event3. At that point neither event1 nor event4 happened, so C1 is false at the start. Therefore C1 does not hold always.

Answer: False
---
False

Reasoning: C1 is ""event1 or event4 happens."" C2 says C1 holds at all times. The initial event is event3. From event3 we may have event5 next (allowed: after event3 → event1, event4, event5, or event6). At that point neither event1 nor event4 happens, so C1 is false there. Therefore C1 does not always hold, and C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" 
- C2: ""C1 does not hold.""

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is of the form P → P (where P = ""event3 happens""), which is a tautology in classical logic: it is always true regardless of whether P is true or false.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- Since C1 always holds, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" That is a logical tautology (p → p) and is always true under standard propositional logic, regardless of whether event3 actually occurs. C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, i.e. that C1 is false. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" Symbolically: event3 → event3.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- Any formula of the form P → P is a logical tautology: it is always true (true when P is true, and also true when P is false).
- Therefore C1 holds regardless of the event rules or whether event3 actually occurs.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- Since C1 holds, the claim ""C1 does not hold"" is false.

False

Counterexample (a valid infinite trace avoiding event1 even if C1 holds):
Start with event8 (given), then choose 4 (8 -> 4), then 3 (4 -> 3), then 2 (3 -> 2), then back to 3 (2 -> 3), and repeat 3 -> 2 -> 3 forever. None of these states are event1, and event5 is never reached, so C1 (5 -> 4) being true does not force event1 to occur. Therefore C2 is false.
---
You ask whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the transition rules and starting at event8.

Interpretation:
- C1: whenever event5 happens, the next event must be event4 (i.e., we restrict the event5-outcomes to {4}).
- We start at event8 and follow the given ""after X, either ... must happen"" rules nondeterministically.

Key transitions (deduplicated):
- 8 -> {1,4,6,7,9}
- 4 -> {1,3,6,7,9}
- 6 -> {3,8}
- 3 -> {1,2,8,9}
- 2 -> {1,3,7,8}
- 5 -> {3,4,6} (under C1 this becomes {4})
- 7 -> {1,3,4}
- 9 -> {1,2,4,5,7,8}
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,6}

Counterexample path that respects all rules and C1 but never hits event1:
- 8 -> 4 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> ... (repeat)
Each chosen step is allowed, and none forces event1 (and C1 only affects transitions from 5, which this path never takes).

Because there is a valid execution starting at 8, consistent with all rules plus C1, that never produces event1, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis: C1 = (event6 happens or event9 happens). C2 says C1 eventually holds (i.e., at some future point event6 or event9 must occur).
- Interpret rules as nondeterministic transitions: after each event X the next event must be chosen from the listed set.
- Build the reachable subset that avoids 6 and 9. From the rules we can choose transitions that avoid 6, 9, and 8:
  - 2 -> 1 (allowed; 2 also can go to 3,4,7)
  - 1 -> 3 (allowed; 1 also can go to 4,5)
  - 3 -> 4 (allowed; 3 also can go to 1,5)
  - 4 -> 2 (allowed; 4 also can go to 3,5)
- This gives a cycle 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 that never visits event6 or event9 (and never visits 8, which would force 6).
- Because the rules allow choosing those transitions indefinitely, there exists an infinite behavior starting from the initial event2 that never reaches event6 or event9.
- Therefore it is not guaranteed that C1 will eventually hold, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2.
- From event2 we may choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 we may choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we may choose event3 (allowed).
- Thus we can follow the infinite loop 2 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... which never visits event6 or event9.
- Because there exists a valid infinite execution avoiding both event6 and event9, it is not guaranteed that ""event6 or event9 eventually happens."" Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event6 happens or event9 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually event6 or event9 occurs).

From the rules we have transitions (relevant subset):
- 2 -> {1,3,4,6,7,8}
- 1 -> {3,4,5,6,9}
- 3 -> {1,4,5,6,9}
- 4 -> {2,3,5,9}
- 5 -> {3,7,8}
- 7 -> {3,4,8,9}
- 8 -> 6
- 6 -> {2,3,4,5,9}
- 9 -> {2,4,8}

Starting at event2, one can avoid both 6 and 9 forever by always choosing successors that stay in {1,3,5}. For example:
- 2 -> 1 (allowed)
- 1 -> 5 (allowed)
- 5 -> 3 (allowed)
- 3 -> 1 (allowed)
and repeat 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1 ... indefinitely.

This infinite execution never visits 6 or 9, so C1 never holds on that run. Because the system can avoid 6 and 9 indefinitely, ""C1 eventually holds"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event1 (given).
- From event1 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 choose event6 (allowed).
- Repeat 6 → 3 → 6 → 3 ... indefinitely.

This infinite path (1,4,6,3,6,3,...) never contains event7 (and also never needs event5). Therefore event7 is not guaranteed to occur in all possible sequences, so C1 (""Event7 always happens"") is false. Since C2 asserts C1 holds (and event5 happens), C2 is also false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- We start at event1. From the rules: 1 -> {4,7,9}.
- To show ""event7 always happens"" (C1) would require that every possible sequence of choices from the initial state eventually visits 7.
- But there is a cycle that avoids 7: 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1. Those transitions are allowed (1→4, 4→5, 5→1) and none force a move to 7, so you can loop this cycle indefinitely without ever seeing event7.
- Therefore C1 is false (event7 is not inevitable).
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds and event5 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false as well (even though event5 can occur, C2 requires both conditions).

Thus the hypothesis C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules: 1 -> {4,7,9}, 4 -> {5,6,7,8,9}, 5 -> {1,4,7,9}, etc.
- There exists a cycle that never includes event7: 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 ... . By repeatedly choosing those transitions, event7 is avoided forever.
- Therefore C1 (""Event7 always happens"") is false. Since C2 requires C1 to hold (and event5 to happen), C2 is also false."

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: event4 happens or event1 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., NOT (event4 OR event1)).

Step 2 — use given facts:
- The context states ""Initially, event4 happened."" So event4 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- Since event4 is true, C1 (event4 OR event1) is true.
- Therefore C2, which asserts C1 does not hold, is false.

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happened.
- From the rules: after event5, the next state must be one of {event1, event4, event7, event9}.
- C1 asserts event1 happens in the next state — this is possible but not guaranteed (could be event4, event7, or event9 instead).
- event6 is not among the possible next events from event5, so event6 does not necessarily happen in the next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds or event6 happens"") is not guaranteed by the given information.

False
---
Reasoning:
- The initial event is event5.
- From the context: after event5 the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event7, event9}.
- C1 asserts ""event1 happens in the next state"" — that is not guaranteed, because next could be event4, event7, or event9.
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds or event6 happens"" — i.e. the next event is event1 or event6.
- But event6 is not in the set of possible next events after event5, so it cannot occur in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed: for example, choosing next = event4 makes both C1 and event6 false, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We start from the given initial event: event5 happened.

From the rules: ""After event5, either event1, event4, event7, or event9 must happen."" Thus the next-state event is one of {event1, event4, event7, event9}.

C1 asserts event1 happens in the next state — that is not guaranteed because the next event could be event4, event7, or event9 instead.

C2 is ""C1 holds or event6 happens"" (i.e., event1 or event6 in the next state). From the possible next events after event5, event6 is not among them, so neither disjunct is guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start in state event5. The rule for after event5 says the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4, event6, event7, event8, event9}. Because event9 is explicitly allowed as a next event, we cannot guarantee that ""event9 does not happen"" in the next state. Thus C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state, so C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event9 does not happen (in the current state).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state, event9 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the context and transitions:
- Initially event5 happened, so C1 is true for the current state (event9 did not happen now).
- The rules: after event5, one of {event1, event3, event4, event6, event7, event8, event9} must happen. That explicitly allows event9 as a possible next event.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- Because event9 is a permitted successor after event5, the next state might be event9.
- Therefore we cannot guarantee that event9 does not happen in the next state; C1 need not hold there.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says “Event9 does not happen.”
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next step, event9 does not happen).
- Initially event5 happened. The transition rule for event5 explicitly allows the next event to be event9 (""After event5, either ... event9 must happen"" — i.e. event9 is one possible next event).
- Because a next state exists where event9 does happen, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state.
Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event is event4.
- From event4 one allowed next event is event5.
- From event5 one allowed next event is event3.
- From event3 one allowed next event is event4.
- Thus 4 → 5 → 3 → 4 is a valid cycle that can repeat indefinitely without ever producing event9.

Because there exists a reachable infinite sequence that never contains event9, ""Event9 always happens"" (C1) is false, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Start at event4. From 4 you can go to 5, and from 5 you can go back to 4 (4 -> 5 -> 4 is allowed).
- Repeating that loop indefinitely (4,5,4,5,...) never visits event9.
- Therefore event9 does not always happen, so C1 is false. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event4 occurred.
- From event4 one allowed next is event5; from event5 one allowed next is event4. So 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 ... is a valid infinite sequence given the rules.
- That infinite path never contains event9, so ""Event9 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Since C1 is not true, the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""event8 happens in the next state.""
- Initially event1 happens. After event1, event3 is an allowed next event.
- After event3, event8 is an allowed next event.
- So one possible sequence is: event1 -> event3 -> event8. At the state immediately after event3, the next state has event8, so C1 holds there.
- Therefore there exists a future state where C1 is true, so C2 (C1 eventually holds) is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1, one allowed successor is event3 (rule: after event1 -> {2,3,4,5,6,7}), so we can move to a state where event3 happened.
- From event3, one allowed successor is event8 (rule: after event3 -> {1,2,5,8,9}), so we can choose the next state to be event8.
- Let state0 = event1, state1 = event3, state2 = event8. At state1 the proposition C1 (""event8 happens in the next state"") holds because the next state (state2) is event8.
- Therefore, starting from the initial state, there is a future state (state1) where C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
---
Plan:
- C1 says ""Event8 happens in the next state"" (i.e., from some current state the immediate next event is event8).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some reachable state at which the next event is event8).

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens.
- From event1, event3 is allowed (after event1, event2/event3/event4/event5/event6/event7 may happen).
- From event3, event8 is allowed (after event3, event1/event2/event5/event8/event9 may happen).
- Therefore there is a reachable state (the state after event3) at which event8 can be the next event, so C1 holds at that reachable state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning (counterexample path): start with event4 (given). Choose transitions that avoid event1, event2 and event9:

- event4 -> event3 (allowed: after event4 either event3 or event7).
- event3 -> event7 (allowed: after event3 one option is event7).
- event7 -> event4 (allowed: after event7 one option is event4).

This yields the cycle 4 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> ... which can repeat indefinitely. In this run neither event1 nor event2 nor event9 ever occurs, so C1 (event2 and event1) does not hold and event9 does not happen. Therefore C2 (C1 holds or event9 happens) is not guaranteed by the context.
---
We ask whether C2 (either (event2 and event1) holds, or event9 happens) is forced by the rules given that initially event4 happened.

Find a counterexample path (a sequence of allowed events) that starts from event4 and avoids both event9 and having both event2 and event1 occur.

From event4 we may go to event3 (rule: after event4 either event3 or event7). From event3 we may go to event5 (after event3 one of {event1,event5,event6,event7,event9}). From event5 we may go to event6 (after event5 one of {event2,event6}). From event6 we may go back to event4 (after event6 one of {event2,event4,event8,event9}). That yields the cycle:

event4 -> event3 -> event5 -> event6 -> event4 -> ...

This cycle never includes event9, and never includes event1 or event2. Thus it never satisfies C1 (event2 and event1) and never triggers event9. Because such an allowed execution exists, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (counterexample trace):
- Initially event4.
- Choose the allowed next events to avoid event1, event2, and event9:
  4 -> 3 (allowed: 3 or 7)
  3 -> 5 (allowed: 1,5,6,7,9; pick 5)
  5 -> 6 (allowed: 2 or 6; pick 6)
  6 -> 4 (allowed: 2,4,8,9; pick 4)
- This yields a loop 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4 that can repeat forever without ever producing event1, event2, or event9.

Thus it is possible to follow the rules and never reach event9 nor have both event2 and event1 occur, so C2 (C1 holds or event9 happens) is not guaranteed. Final answer: False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answering step by step.

1. Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the immediate next state both event2 and event1 occur.

2. Starting point: initially event9 happened.

3. From the rules: after event9, the next event must be either event3 or event4 (the rule ""After event9, either event3, or event4 must happen"" appears repeatedly). That means the immediate next state can only be event3 or event4, not event1 or event2.

4. The rules read ""either ... must happen"", which implies a single event choice for the next state (not multiple simultaneous events). Even if event3 or event4 can later lead to event1 or event2, those would be later states, not the immediate next state.

5. Therefore it is impossible for both event2 and event1 to hold in the next state after the initial event9.

Final answer: False
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true given the rules and the initial state.

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both in the same state).
2. Initially event9 happened.
3. The rules for ""After event9"" (given repeatedly) allow only event3 or event4 to happen next.
4. Therefore the immediate next state after the initial state can only be event3 or event4 — neither event2 nor event1 occurs there.
5. Even if event3 can lead later to event1 or event2, C2 requires C1 to hold in the immediate next state, which is impossible because that state is either event3 or event4, not both event2 and event1.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event9 happens. The rules say: after event9, either event3 or event4 must happen next.
- Therefore the immediate next state can be only event3 or event4.
- C1 requires event2 and event1 to both happen in that next state. But the next state is a single event (either 3 or 4), so it cannot simultaneously be events 2 and 1.
- Hence C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 holds (is true).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event7 happens."" So C2 is true exactly if event7 must happen (C1 already true).

Step 2 — examine the rules and look for a counterexample to event7 necessarily occurring:
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 we can go to event3.
- From event3 we can go to event9.
- From event9 we must go to event3.
Thus there is a valid infinite loop 3 → 9 → 3 → 9 → ... reachable from the start that never includes event7.

Because there exists a valid sequence starting from the given initial event that never produces event7, event7 is not guaranteed to happen. Therefore C2 (C1 holds and event7 happens) is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 always holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event7 happens."" Since C1 always holds, C2 reduces to whether event7 can happen at all (i.e., whether there is a sequence of allowed events from the initial state that produces event7).

Step 2 — can event7 happen starting from the initial event6?
- From event6, one allowed next event is event1.
- From event1, one allowed next event is event7.
So there is a valid sequence 6 → 1 → 7 that produces event7. (There are other paths to 7 as well, e.g. 6 → 5 → 7 or 6 → 8 → 7.)

Conclusion
- C1 holds (tautologically) and event7 is reachable, so C2 can be satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event7 happens."" Since C1 holds, C2 is equivalent to ""event7 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the transition rules and look for a counterexample that avoids event7:
- From event6 we can go to event3.
- From event3 we can go to event9.
- From event9 we must go to event3.
Thus 6 → 3 → 9 → 3 → 9 → ... is a valid infinite execution that never visits event7.

Because there is a valid sequence starting from the initial event6 that never produces event7, event7 is not forced by the rules. Therefore C2 does not hold.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

- The hypothesis C2 says both event6 and event8 happen (C2 = ""event6 happens and C1 holds"", with C1 = ""event8 happens"").
- From the context the only given initial fact is that event9 happens.
- From event9 the allowed next events include event2 (the rule after event9: one of {2,3,4,6,8}).
- If we choose event2, then from event2 the allowed next events include event3 (after event2: one of {3,5,6}).
- From event3 the allowed next events include event2 (after event3: one of {2,5,6,7,8,9}).
- Thus there is a valid infinite path 9 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... that never visits event6 or event8.
- Because such a path is allowed by the rules, event6 and event8 are not forced to happen; C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1 is just ""event8 happens"" (it redundantly repeats event8).
- C2 is ""event6 happens and C1 holds"" i.e. both event6 and event8 happen.

Step 2 — use the rules and initial fact
- Initially event9 happened.
- From the rules: after event9, one of {event2, event3, event4, event6, event8} must happen. So we can choose event6.
- After event6, one of {event2, event3, event7, event8} must happen. We can choose event8.

That yields a valid sequence 9 → 6 → 8 in which both event6 and event8 occur.

Conclusion: C2 can be satisfied, so the answer is True.
---
We ask whether C2 (event6 happens and C1 holds) is entailed by the rules given the initial fact event9.

C1 is simply ""event8 happens"". C2 requires both event6 and event8 to occur. To show C2 is not entailed it suffices to give a valid sequence of allowed choices starting from event9 that never produces event6 or event8.

From event9 the rule allows event2 (among other choices). From event2 the rule allows event3. From event3 the rule allows event2. So one valid infinite trace is:

event9 -> event2 -> event3 -> event2 -> event3 -> ...

All chosen successors are allowed by the rules, and this trace never includes event6 or event8. Hence event8 (C1) and event6 are not guaranteed to happen. Therefore C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = NOT(C1) = ""Event2 does happen.""

Step 2 — examine the transition rules and initial condition:
- Initially event5 happens.
- From event5 you may go to {1,4,7,8,9}.
- From event1 you may go to {4,5,6,7,9}, so in particular 1 -> 5 is allowed.

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence avoiding event2:
- Start at 5, go to 1, then back to 5, and repeat: 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ...
- This infinite sequence follows the allowed transitions and never visits event2, so C1 can hold.

Conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid execution where event2 never occurs, C1 is not refuted by the rules, so C2 (""Event2 does happen"") is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
C2 states ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is ""Event2 does not happen,"" C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 does happen.""

From the rules: after event5 one possible next event is event4, and after event4 one possible next event is event2. Starting at the initial event5, we can take the sequence 5 → 4 → 2, so event2 can occur. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false, so C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning: C1 states ""Event2 does not happen."" From the rules, initially event5 happened, and after event5 one possible next event is event4. After event4 one possible next event is event2. Hence there is a sequence (event5 → event4 → event2) in which event2 does happen, so C1 is false and therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event6 happens in the next state.""
- From the initial condition we know event7 happened. The rules say: after event7, one of {event1, event2, event5, event6, event9} must happen.
- Therefore there is a possible next-state where event6 happens (i.e., C1 holds immediately).
- Since C1 holds in that (next) state, ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Goal: decide if C2 (""Event4 happens and Event3 eventually happens"") is true given initial event6 and the transition rules.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Initially event6 has occurred.
2. From event6 the allowed next events are {event1, event4, event7}. So we can choose event4 next — hence event4 can happen.
3. After event4 the allowed next events include event3 (set {event1, event3, event5, event7, event8}). So from event4 we can choose event3, so event3 can happen subsequently.
4. Therefore there exists a sequence (6 → 4 → 3) that makes event4 occur and later event3 occur, satisfying both parts of C2.

Final answer:
True
---
False

Reasoning:
- C2 asserts both (a) Event4 happens and (b) Event3 eventually happens.
- From the initial Event6, Event4 can indeed occur (6 -> 4). So (a) is possible but not forced.
- However, Event3 is not inevitable: there is a valid infinite execution that never reaches Event3 while still including Event4. For example:
  6 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> ... 
  Here 4 occurs but the trace cycles among {6,4,1} and never visits 3.
- Because Event3 need not happen in all possible executions, the conjunction in C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Therefore C2 is false.
---
We must decide whether ""Event4 happens and Event3 eventually happens"" is guaranteed given the rules and initial event6.

From the rules (unique transitions):
- after 6: {1,4,7}
- after 1: {2,4,5,6,8,9}
- after 4: {1,3,5,7,8}
- after 7: {1,6,9}
- after 2: {1,3,4,5,6,8}
- after 5: {2,6,7,8,9}
- after 8: {1,2,4,7,9}
- after 9: {1,2,3,4,5,6,8}
- after 3: {1,4,5,6,9}

To refute C2 it suffices to exhibit a valid (allowed) sequence from the initial event6 that never visits event4 or event3. From 6 we may choose 1, and from 1 we may choose 6. Thus the infinite loop 6 → 1 → 6 → 1 → ... is allowed and never visits event4 or event3. Therefore event4 does not necessarily happen and event3 does not necessarily eventually happen. Since C2 requires both event4 and event3 to occur, C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says: ""Event7 does not happen."" C2 is the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event7 does happen.""
- From the rules, starting at event3 we can follow: 3 → 8 (allowed), 8 → 1 (allowed), 1 → 5 (allowed). Event5 is terminal (no successors).
- This full execution (3, 8, 1, 5) contains no event7, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""Event7 does not happen."" C2 is the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event7 does happen.""
- From the initial event3 we can follow 3 -> 2 (allowed), then 2 -> 1 (allowed), then 1 -> 5 (allowed). Event5 has no outgoing transitions, so the sequence 3,2,1,5 is a valid complete execution that never visits event7.
- Because there exists a valid run in which event7 does not occur, C1 can hold; therefore C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold) is not true.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event7 does not happen.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event7 does happen).

Step 2 — examine the rules and look for a counterexample to C2
- Start: event3.
- From event3 we can go to event2 (allowed).
- From event2 we can go to event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we can go to event5 (allowed).
- event5 is terminal (no further events).

That sequence is: 3 → 2 → 1 → 5. It follows all given rules and never includes event7, so C1 can hold.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event7 does not happen, C1 does not necessarily fail. Therefore the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not true.

Final answer: False"

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We must decide whether ""C2: (Event4 and Event2) OR Event3"" is guaranteed by the rules given the initial fact ""Initially event5 happened.""

1) Interpret rules (condensed):
- Initially: event5.
- event5 -> event9 (forced).
- event9 -> one of {event1, event4, event5, event6}.
- event4 -> one of {event3, event5, event6}.
- event6 -> one of {event2, event3, event9}.
- event3 -> one of {event1, event6, event9}.
- event1 -> event9.
- event2 -> one of {event1, event4, event7, event8}.
- event7 -> one of {event1, event2, event3, event9}.
- event8 -> one of {event1, event4, event7, event9}.

2) Build a counterexample path to show C2 is not guaranteed:
- Start: event5 (given).
- From event5, event9 must happen.
- From event9, choose event5 (allowed).
- From that event5, event9 must happen again.
- Repeat the cycle: 5 -> 9 -> 5 -> 9 -> ...

This infinite sequence is allowed by the rules. Along it:
- Event3 never occurs.
- Event2 never occurs.
- Event4 never occurs.

Thus neither Event3 occurs nor do both Event4 and Event2 occur. That makes C2 false on this allowed path.

Conclusion: C2 is not entailed (not guaranteed) by the context. Final answer: False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, event9 must happen. So we get event9.
- After event9, one possible next event is event5 (rules allow 9 -> 5).
- From event5 we again must go to event9, so there is a valid infinite path 5 -> 9 -> 5 -> 9 -> ...
- Along this infinite loop, event3 never occurs, and neither event4 nor event2 ever occurs. Therefore C1 (event4 and event2) never holds on that path, and event3 never holds either.
- Since there exists a permitted execution where neither C1 nor event3 ever happens, C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is not guaranteed by the given rules.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, event9 must happen. So event9 occurs.
- After event9, one of event1, event4, event5, or event6 must happen. This is a nondeterministic choice.
- If we repeatedly choose event5 each time (event9 → event5 → event9 → event5 → ...), we never produce event3, and we never produce event4 or event2. This infinite loop is allowed by the rules.
- C1 requires both event4 and event2 to happen; that does not occur in the loop. Event3 also does not occur.
- Therefore there exists an allowed sequence in which neither C1 nor event3 happens, so C2 (C1 or event3) is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event5 happens).
- C1 asserts: event6 always happens (i.e., every allowed sequence must contain event6).

Step 2 — check C1
- We have an initial event5.
- From event5 the allowed successors are {6,7}. To refute ""event6 always happens"" it is enough to exhibit a valid continuation that never includes event6.
- Choose successors to avoid 6: 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> ... This is legal at every step:
  - 5 -> 7 allowed (after 5: {6,7})
  - 7 -> 1 allowed (after 7: {1,3,5,6,8})
  - 1 -> 3 allowed (after 1: {3,4,6})
  - 3 -> 4 allowed (after 3: {4,5,6,7})
  - 4 -> 9 allowed (after 4: {3,5,6,7,8,9})
  - 9 -> 3 allowed (after 9: {3,5,7,8})
- The cycle 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 3 can repeat indefinitely, never visiting event6. Thus there exists a valid infinite trace without event6, so event6 is not forced to occur.

Therefore C1 is false.

Step 3 — conclude about C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event5 does occur initially).

Final answer: False
---
We need C2 to be true, i.e. (C1 holds) AND (event5 happens). Event5 does happen initially, so the only question is C1: ""Event6 always happens"" — does every allowed sequence include event6?

From the rules (condensed):
- Initially: 5.
- After 5 → {6,7}
- After 7 → {1,3,5,6,8}
- After 1 → {3,4,6}
- After 3 → {4,5,6,7}
- After 4 → {3,5,6,7,8,9}
(others exist but are not needed)

Construct a cycle avoiding event6:
5 → 7 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 5
Each step is allowed by the rules and none of these events is 6. Thus we can repeat this loop indefinitely and never fire event6. Therefore event6 is not guaranteed to happen in all sequences, so C1 is false.

Since C1 is false, C2 (C1 holds and event5 happens) is false (even though event5 does happen).

Final answer: False
---
False

Reason: C1 (""event6 always happens"") is false because there is a valid infinite trace starting from the initial event5 that never reaches event6. Example:
5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... 
All transitions above are allowed by the rules (1 can go to 3, 3 can go to 4, 4 can go to 3), and none force event6. Because C1 fails, C2 (C1 holds and event5 happens) is false, even though event5 did happen initially."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened, so C1 (event5 or event1) holds at the initial step.
- But the rules include: ""After event5, either event3 or event4 must happen."" Both event3 and event4 are neither event5 nor event1.
- Therefore a permitted next step is event3 (or event4), at which point C1 is false.
- Because there's at least one reachable step where C1 does not hold, C1 is not always true.

Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 asserts ""Event5 happens or Event1 happens.""
- Initially Event5 has happened, so C1 holds at the start.
- But after Event5 the rules require either Event3 or Event4 next. Choose Event3 (allowed).
- At the step where Event3 occurs, neither Event5 nor Event1 occurs, so C1 is false at that step.
- Therefore C1 is not true at every step (not an invariant), so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Interpretation: C1 asserts ""event5 happens or event1 happens"" at the current step; C2 asserts that C1 holds at all times (an invariant).

Counterexample from the rules:
- Initially event5 happened, so C1 is true at the initial step.
- The rules state: after event5, either event3 or event4 must happen. So a valid next step is event3.
- At that next step event3 has happened; neither event5 nor event1 happened at that step, so C1 is false there.

Thus C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step, concise):

- Hypothesis C1 is the statement ""if event8 happens then event9 happens"" (8 → 9). C2 states ""if C1 holds, then event6 happens"" — i.e. KB ∪ {C1} entails event6.

- From the context we have an initial event1 and nondeterministic transition rules. From event1 one permitted next event is event4 (1 → {4,6,8,9}), from event4 one permitted next is event5 (4 → {5,7,8,9}), and from event5 one permitted next is event1 (5 → {1,3,7}). That yields a cycle: 1 → 4 → 5 → 1.

- This cycle never includes event6, and every step in the cycle is allowed by the given rules. Adding C1 (8 → 9) does not force event8 to occur, so C1 does not force leaving this cycle. Therefore there is a model (a valid sequence) in which C1 holds and event6 never occurs.

- Because there exists a valid behavior consistent with the rules and C1 that avoids event6, C2 is not entailed.

Thus C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Consolidate the transition rules (removing duplicates):
  - 1 -> {3,4,7,8}
  - 2 -> {4,8,9}
  - 3 -> {4,6,7}
  - 4 -> {2,3,5,6,7,8}
  - 5 -> {1,6,7,8,9}
  - 6 -> {3,4,7,9}
  - 7 -> {1,2,3,5,6,8}
  - 8 -> {1,2,7}
  - 9 -> {2,4,6,8}
- We assume C1 (event7 does not happen) and ask whether event1 must then occur.
- Exhibit a valid infinite path that never uses event7 and never uses event1:
  - Start: 4 (given)
  - 4 -> 8 (allowed)
  - 8 -> 2 (allowed; 8->1 would produce event1, but 8->2 is allowed and avoids 1 and 7)
  - 2 -> 9 (allowed)
  - 9 -> 6 (allowed)
  - 6 -> 3 (allowed)
  - 3 -> 4 (allowed)
  - Repeat the cycle 4 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 ...
- All chosen transitions are allowed and avoid events 1 and 7. Hence, under C1 it is not necessary that event1 happens.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 one allowed successor is event2.
- From event2 one allowed successor is event4.
- Thus there is a valid infinite sequence 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → ... that never includes event7.
- That sequence also never includes event1, so assuming ""event7 does not happen"" does not force event1 to occur.
- Therefore C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is false.
---
False

Reason: Start at event4. If event7 never happens, take the allowed transition 4 -> 2 and then 2 -> 4, and repeat (4 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> ...). All these moves are permitted and avoid both event7 and event1, so event1 is not forced to occur. Hence ""if event7 does not happen then event1 happens"" is false."

Votes: {'False': 2, 'True': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- From the rules, after event5 the next event must be one of {6,7,9}.
- From event6 the next can be {2,3,4,7}; from event7 the next can be {2,5}; from event9 the next can be {1,2,3,6}.
- There is a cycle 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 that never visits event8.
- Since the sequence can start at event8 and immediately go to event5 (after 8 one allowed next is 5), we can produce a run: 8, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7, ... which contains event5 but never contains event8 again.
- Therefore it is not always true that ""if event5 happens, then event8 happens.""

So C2 (that C1 always holds) is False.
---
False

Counterexample (one possible future): initial event8 -> event5 -> event6 -> event7 -> event2 -> event5 -> ...  
This cycle (5 → 6 → 7 → 2 → 5 ...) is allowed by the rules and never visits event3 or event4 (the only events that lead to event8), so event8 need not occur after event5. Therefore ""If event5 happens, then event8 happens"" is not always true.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says: whenever event5 happens, event8 happens (i.e., event5 implies event8).
- From the rules: after event8 one possible next event is event5, and after event5 the next event must be one of {6,7,9}.
- There is a cycle that avoids event8: 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 is permitted because
  - after 5: 6 is allowed;
  - after 6: 7 is allowed;
  - after 7: 5 is allowed.
- Starting from the given initial event8, we can follow 8 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> ... and never hit event8 again.
- That provides a valid sequence where event5 occurs but event8 does not necessarily occur afterward, so C1 does not always hold.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 asserts ""event2 eventually happens OR event5 happens."" For C2 to be true (entailed) it must hold on every possible execution starting from the initial event3.

From the rules (deduplicated):
- 3 → {1,4,5,7}
- 1 → {2,4}
- 4 → {3,5,6,8}
- 6 → {7,8,9}
- 7 → {2,4,5,6,8}
- 8 → {1,2,3,4,5,6,9}
- 9 → {1,2,3,4,7}
- 2 → {5,7,8,9}
- 5 → {3,4,6,7,8,9}

To show C2 is not necessarily true, it suffices to exhibit a possible infinite path from the initial 3 that never visits 2 and never visits 5. One such cycle is:

3 → 7 → 6 → 8 → 1 → 4 → 3 → ... 

All these transitions are allowed, and none of the states in the cycle are 2 or 5, so along this run neither event2 nor event5 ever occurs. Therefore C1 (event2 eventually happens) can fail and event5 can also fail on that run, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3 the allowed next events are {1,4,5,7}. To avoid event5, pick event1 (allowed).
- From event1 the allowed next events are {2,4}. To avoid event2, pick event4.
- From event4 the allowed next events are {3,5,6,8}. To avoid event5, pick event3.
- That returns us to event3, so we have a cycle 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 that can repeat forever.
- This infinite path never visits event2 nor event5, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed, and the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event5 happens"") is also not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (summary):
- From event3 you can reach event2 (3 -> 1 -> 2), so event2 is possible but not inevitable.
- To show it's not inevitable, give a cycle that never hits event2: 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 1 -> ... (1 can go to 4 instead of 2). This infinite choice sequence avoids event2.
- Event5 is also not inevitable (the same cycle avoids 5).
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" Since neither C1 (inevitable event2) nor inevitable event5 holds, C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- From the context build the transition graph:
  1 -> {2,3}
  2 -> {3,5,6,8,9}
  3 -> {1,2,7,9}
  4 -> {1,2,7,8,9}
  5 -> {1,3,4,8,9}
  6 -> {3,7,8}
  7 -> {2,3,5,6}
  8 -> {2,5,7}
  9 -> {1,3,5,6}

- Start at event2. To falsify the hypothesis C2 (""event8 happens or C1 holds""), it suffices to exhibit a possible run in which (a) event8 never happens and (b) event5 does not always happen (in fact, never happens on that run).

- Construct such a run by always choosing transitions that avoid 5 and 8. Example infinite run:
  2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...
  Every step above selects a successor that is not 5 and not 8 (all those successors are permitted by the rules). Thus this run contains no event8 and no event5.

- Because there exists a possible run starting from the initial condition where neither event8 occurs nor event5 ever occurs, the disjunction ""event8 happens or event5 always happens"" is not guaranteed by the premises.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
We ask whether in every possible trace (starting from the initial event2) either event8 occurs or event5 is inevitable (C1). To disprove C2 it suffices to give a valid trace where neither event8 ever occurs nor event5 ever occurs (so C1 fails and event8 does not happen).

From the rules:
- After event2, event6 is allowed.
- After event6, event7 is allowed.
- After event7, event2 is allowed.
So the infinite loop 2 → 6 → 7 → 2 → 6 → 7 → ... is a valid trace starting from the initial event2 that never visits event8 and never visits event5. Thus there exists a compliant execution where neither “event8 happens” nor “event5 always happens” holds.

Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the meanings
- C1: ""Event5 always happens"" — i.e., in every possible sequence (from the initial event2) event5 occurs.
- C2: ""Event8 happens or C1 holds"" — the disjunction of (event8 inevitably happens) or (event5 always happens).

Step 2 — find a counterexample sequence
Start at the given initial event2 and follow allowed transitions while avoiding event5 and event8:
- 2 -> 3 (allowed: from 2 you may go to 3)
- 3 -> 1 (allowed: from 3 you may go to 1)
- 1 -> 2 (allowed: from 1 you may go to 2)

This yields the infinite cycle 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... .
- This cycle never visits event5, so C1 (event5 always happens) is false.
- It also never visits event8, so ""event8 happens"" is not guaranteed either.

Therefore the disjunction C2 is false.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event8 happened. From 8 we may go to 5, 6, or 7.
- Choose 7 (allowed). From 7 we may go to 3, 5, 6, or 8.
- Choose 3 (allowed). From 3 we may go to 2, 4, 7, or 9.
- Choose 2 (avoid 9). From 2 we may go to 1, 4, 5, 7, or 8.
- Choose 1. From 1 we may go to 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8.
- Choose 3 again.

Thus we have a loop 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 reachable from the initial 8 (8 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 ...) that never visits event9. Therefore event9 does not ""always happen"" (C1 is false), so the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
---

---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Start at event8. From 8 you can go to 7 (since after 8, either 5, 6, or 7 must happen).
- From 7 you can go back to 8 (since after 7, either 3, 5, 6, or 8 must happen).
- Thus the sequence 8 → 7 → 8 → 7 → ... is valid and never includes event9.
- Therefore event9 does not always happen (C1 is false), so the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Sample responses:
We ask whether C2 (""Event1 happens and (Event6 or Event8 happens)"") is entailed by the given rules starting from event7.

Reasoning:
- Initial: event7 happens.
- From event7 we may choose event2 (rules allow event2, event3, or event6).
- After event2 we may choose event5 (rules allow event1, event5, or event8).
- After event5 we may choose event4 (rules require event2 or event4).
- After event4 we must go to event2.
- Thus we can follow the cycle 7 → 2 → 5 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 4 → ... forever.
- In this cycle we never take event6 or event8, and we never take event1 (we always choose the options that avoid 1, 6, and 8).
- Therefore there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which C1 (event6 or event8) is false and event1 never occurs, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (counterexample trace):
- Initially event7 happens.
- From event7 choose event2 (allowed: 7 -> {2,3,6}).
- From event2 choose event5 (allowed: 2 -> {1,5,8}).
- From event5 choose event4 (allowed: 5 -> {2,4}).
- From event4 we must go to event2 (4 -> 2).

This yields a loop 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 ... that can repeat indefinitely. Along this run:
- Neither event6 nor event8 ever occurs (so C1 is false).
- Event1 never occurs.

Thus C2 (""Event1 happens and (Event6 or Event8) happens"") is not guaranteed by the premises, so C2 is False.
---
You want to know whether C2 (""Event1 happens and (Event6 or Event8) happens"") is entailed by the given rules starting from the initial event7.

Step 1 — extract the relevant rules:
- Initially: event7.
- After event7: one of {event2, event3, event6}.
- After event2: one of {event1, event5, event8}.
- After event5: one of {event2, event4}.
- After event4: event2.
(Other rules exist, but these are enough to build a counterexample.)

Step 2 — produce a valid trace that falsifies C2:
- Start: event7.
- Choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 → event2 (forced).
Now we can repeat the cycle 2 → 5 → 4 → 2 indefinitely.

This trace never produces event1, event6, or event8. Therefore C1 (event6 or event8) is false on this trace, and event1 is also false, so C2 is false in this possible execution.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed by the rules (there exists a valid sequence where C2 is false).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 is true given the rules.

- Hypothesis: C1 = (event8 happens and event4 happens). C2 = (C1 holds and event8 happens) — i.e., C2 is equivalent to ""event4 happens and event8 happens"" (event8 repeated is redundant).
- Start: initially event2 happened.
- From event2 the rules allow event4, event6, or event8 next.
- Choose the path event2 → event4. From event4 the rules allow event3, event7, or event8 next.
- Then choose event8. That produces both event4 and event8 in the sequence.

Therefore C2 can be satisfied. Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event8 and event4 both happen.
- C2: C1 holds and event8 happens (i.e., event4 and event8 happen, with event8 stated again).

C2 is therefore equivalent to ""event4 and event8 both happen.""

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, one of {event4, event6, event8} must happen.
- After event4, one of {event3, event7, event8} must happen.
(Other rules exist but these suffice.)

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence that yields both events:
- From the initial event2, choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4, choose event8 (allowed).

This sequence (event2 → event4 → event8) satisfies that both event4 and event8 happen, so C1 holds; event8 also happens, so C2 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
We need to decide whether both event8 and event4 can occur starting from the initial condition (event2).

1. Initially event2 happened.
2. After event2, one allowed next event is event8. So we can choose event8.
3. After event8, the rule requires either event1 or event6. Choose event6.
4. After event6, one allowed next event is event4. So we can choose event4.

Thus the sequence event2 -> event8 -> event6 -> event4 is valid under the rules, so both event8 and event4 occur. Therefore C1 is true. C2 is C1 plus event8 (redundant, since C1 already asserts event8), so C2 is also true.

Final answer: True"

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, C1 says event7 eventually happens. The context begins with ""Initially, event7 happened,"" so C1 is true in this scenario.

We must decide whether ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is guaranteed by the rules — i.e., whether every possible future sequence that starts from event7 must include event4.

Look at the transition rules:
- After event7, event9 must happen.
- After event9, one of {event1, event2, event6, event7} happens (choice).
- None of these rules force event4 immediately; event4 appears only as an optional successor of event1 or event6 (and as a possible successor of event6), but those successors are choices, not necessities.

Construct a valid infinite trace that avoids event4: repeat event7 → event9 → event7 → event9 → ... indefinitely. Each time after event9 we choose event7, then after event7 we must go to event9, and so on. This trace never includes event4, so event4 is not inevitable even though event7 occurred initially.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says event7 eventually happens. The rules include: after event7, event9 must happen.
- From event9 the allowed next events are {event1, event2, event6, event7}.
- Therefore after 7 → 9 we can choose event7 again (9 → 7), returning to 7 and repeating the same steps.
- This yields an infinite cycle 7 → 9 → 7 → 9 → ... that never visits event4.
- Because there exists a valid sequence starting from event7 that avoids event4 indefinitely, event4 is not guaranteed whenever event7 occurs.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether ""If event7 eventually happens, then event4 happens"" is guaranteed.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event7 happens, so C1 holds.
- From the rules: after event7, event9 must happen (7 -> 9).
- After event9, one of {1,2,6,7} must happen (9 -> {1,2,6,7}).
- It is allowed that 9 -> 7, so we can take the transition 7 -> 9 -> 7.
- Repeating that choice yields an infinite execution 7,9,7,9,... in which event4 never occurs.
- Because there exists a valid execution (consistent with the rules) where event7 occurs yet event4 never happens, the implication ""C1 implies event4"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We need to know whether there exists a valid sequence of events (consistent with the ""after"" rules and starting from event7) in which event6 never occurs (C1) and event2 does occur — i.e., whether C2 is satisfiable.

Start at the given initial event: event7. From the rules:
- From 7 you may go to {2,3,4,5}. So choose 2 (so event2 happens).
- From 2 the allowed next events are {6,7,9}. To keep C1 true we must avoid 6, so choose 9.
- From 9 allowed {1,8}. Choose 8 (avoid 6).
- From 8 allowed {3,4,7}. Choose 3.
- From 3 allowed {5,7,8}. Choose 5.
- From 5 allowed {3,4,6,7,8,9}. Choose 7 (avoiding 6).

Now we are back at 7 and can repeat the same cycle. The cycle 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 8 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 is entirely consistent with the given ""after"" rules and never visits event6, while including event2. Therefore C1 can hold and event2 can happen simultaneously.

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initial event is event7.
- From event7 the allowed next events include event2 (""After event7, either event2, event3, event4, or event5 must happen"").
- So we can have the sequence 7 -> 2, which includes event2 and does not include event6.
- Therefore C1 (event6 does not happen) can hold while event2 happens, so C2 is satisfiable.
---
C2 asserts: (event6 never happens) AND (event2 happens).

We start at event7. From event7 the allowed next events include event2 (7 → 2). After event2 the allowed next events are {6, 7, 9}. To satisfy C1 we must avoid event6; from 2 we can choose 7 (2 → 7). Then from 7 we can again choose 2 (7 → 2), and so on.

Thus there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules that includes event2 and never includes event6 (for example: 7, 2, 7, 2, ...). Therefore C2 can be satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether ""C2: C1 eventually holds"" is true given the rules, where C1 = ""Event7 happens in the next state.""

Step-by-step reasoning
- Initially event6 happened.
- The rule after event6: either event5, event7, or event9 must happen next.
- Therefore there is an available transition 6 -> 7, so in the very next state event7 can occur. That means C1 holds immediately from the initial state.
- If C1 holds now, then ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is satisfied.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---

---
We interpret:
- C1 = ""Event7 happens in the next state"" (i.e. the immediate next event is 7).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point there is a state whose next event is 7). The usual interesting reading is whether this eventuality is guaranteed; we show it is not.

From the context: initially event6 happened. After event6 the next event must be one of {5, 7, 9} — so C1 could hold (if we choose 7) but is not forced. We can follow a run that avoids 7 entirely: choose event9 after event6 (allowed), then choose event4 after event9 (allowed). After event4 no further events can happen (event4 is terminal). Along this run the immediate-next-event is never 7 (initial next was 9, later next was 4, then no next), so there is a complete behavior in which C1 never becomes true.

Therefore C2 (that C1 eventually holds in all runs) is False. 

Final answer: False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start at event1. From the description the allowed successors are:
- 1 -> {2,5,6,7}
- 5 -> {1,3,4}
(and other transitions listed, but these two suffice)

To show C2 (""event7 and event2 always happen"") is false it is enough to exhibit one valid infinite run where either event7 or event2 never occurs. From the initial event1 take the successor 5, and from 5 take successor 1, and repeat: 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... . This is a valid path (1 can go to 5 and 5 can go to 1) that never visits event2 or event7, so C1 fails on that path. Therefore C1 does not always hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event7 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., on every execution/at every point C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and transitions
- Initial event: event1.
- From event1 you may go to {event2, event5, event6, event7}.
- From event5 you may go to {event1, event3, event4}.
  Thus there is a possible cycle 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... that never visits event2 or event7.

Step 3 — counterexample showing C2 fails
- At the initial step (event1) C1 is already false because neither event2 nor event7 has occurred yet.
- Concretely, take the run 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ...; in this run neither event2 nor event7 ever occurs, so C1 does not hold (and thus does not ""always hold"").

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, one allowed next is event5.
- After event5, one allowed next is event1.
- So the infinite trace 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... is valid under the given rules and never includes event2 or event7.
- Thus C1 (""event7 happens and event2 happens"") does not hold in every possible run, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Start at the given initial event8. From event8 you may go to event2, and from event2 you may go back to event8. So the infinite sequence 8 → 2 → 8 → 2 → ... is allowed and never includes event4. In that run C1 (event4 -> event9) is true (vacuously), but event4 does not happen.

Conclusion
Since there is a permitted execution where C1 holds yet event4 never occurs, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore the correct answer is:

False

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C1 just says ""event3 happens"" (the repetition is redundant). C2 says that C1 will eventually hold (i.e., event3 will occur at some future step).
- From the initial event4, one allowed next step is event1 (4 -> 1). From event1 one allowed next step is event2 (1 -> 2). From event2 one allowed next step is event4 (2 -> 4). Thus the sequence 4,1,2,4 is a valid loop according to the rules.
- By repeating that loop indefinitely (4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...), we produce an infinite execution in which event3 never occurs.
- Because there exists a valid execution starting from the initial state where event3 never happens, ""eventually event3"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether ""C1: event3 happens"" eventually holds starting from initial event4.

From the rules:
- After event4, event5 is one allowed next event.
- After event5, event3 is one allowed next event.

So one valid sequence is: event4 (initial) → event5 → event3. Thus event3 does occur at some future step, so C1 can be satisfied, and therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.
---
Plan: show whether every possible future from the initial event4 must eventually produce event3. If there is a possible infinite run that never reaches event3, then C2 (""eventually event3"") is false.

Observations:
- C1 is just ""event3 happens"" (the repetition is redundant). C2 asks whether C1 eventually holds.
- From event4 the allowed next events are {1,5,6,7,9}.
- Many states have non-3 successors, so it may be possible to avoid 3.

Construct an explicit infinite run avoiding event3:
- 4 -> 1 (allowed)
- 1 -> 2 (allowed)
- 2 -> 4 (allowed)

This yields the cycle 4,1,2,4,... which repeats forever and never visits event3. All transitions used are permitted by the rules and never go to event3.

Since there exists at least one possible future from the initial event4 that never reaches event3, it is not guaranteed that event3 eventually happens. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether ""If event8 happens, then event9 happens"" is guaranteed by the rules (i.e., C2).

From the rules:
- 8 -> {1,4,6,7}
- 1 -> {2,7,8}

So there is a reachable 2-step cycle 8 -> 1 -> 8 that avoids event9 entirely. That means it is possible for 8 to occur and for 9 never to occur afterward (the sequence 8,1,8,1,...). Therefore the implication ""If event8 happens, then event9 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---

---
False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Start at the given initial event5.
- Choose transitions: 5 -> 3 (allowed), 3 -> 7 (allowed), 7 -> 8 (allowed). So event8 can occur.
- From event8, pick 1 (8 -> 1 allowed), then from 1 pick 8 (1 -> 8 allowed). This yields the loop 8 -> 1 -> 8 -> 1 ... which never forces event9.
- Because there exists a valid sequence where 8 occurs and 9 never happens, the statement ""If event8 happens, then event9 happens"" is not always true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the statements mean
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., in a state, event3 is absent).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning: in the immediate successor state after the initial state, event3 does not happen.

Step 2 — initial situation
- Initially event4 happened.

Step 3 — what can happen after event4
- The rules explicitly allow after event4 that event3 may happen (after event4, either event1, event3, event5, event6, event7, event8, or event9 must happen).

Step 4 — consequence for C2
- Because there is an immediate successor where event3 does happen, C1 need not hold in the next state. Therefore C2 (""event3 does not happen in the next state"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, event3 does not happen.

Step 2 — Examine the transitions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event5, event6, event7, event8, event9} (event3 is explicitly allowed).

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Because event3 is one of the possible next events after event4, the next state can have event3 occur.
- Therefore it is not guaranteed that ""event3 does not happen"" in the next state; C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 the rules allow event3 as a possible next event (""After event4, either event1, event3, ... must happen"").
- Since event3 can occur next, you cannot guarantee that ""Event3 does not happen"" holds in the next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not entailed and is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning summary:
- C1 says: whenever event8 happens then event6 happens.
- From the rules: after event8, the next event must be either event2 or event3 (no direct requirement of event6).
- Counterexample path avoiding event6: 8 -> 2 -> 8 -> 2 -> 8 ... (2 allows 8, and 8 allows 2), so it’s possible for event8 to occur and yet never have event6 occur afterwards.
- Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Start: event3 can go to event8 (3 -> 8).
- From 8 the allowed next events are 2 or 3.
- There is a valid cycle that avoids event6: 8 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 (since 2 -> 3 and 3 -> 8 are allowed).
- This cycle can repeat indefinitely, so after an occurrence of event8 it is possible to never reach event6.
- Therefore the implication ""if event8 happens then event6 happens"" (C1) does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event3 happens initially.
- From event3 one allowed next event is event8 (3 -> 8).
- From event8 allowed next events are event2 or event3; choose event2 (8 -> 2).
- From event2 allowed next events are event3, event5, or event8; choose event3 (2 -> 3).
- From event3 choose event8 again (3 -> 8).

This gives an allowed cycle 8 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 that never requires event6 to occur. Therefore the implication ""if event8 happens then event6 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:

---
We must decide whether ""C2: Event8 happens and C1 holds"" is guaranteed by the rules given the initial event3. (C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"".)

- From event3 the allowed next events include 6, 7, or 8. So event8 is possible but not forced.
- To show C2 is not guaranteed it suffices to exhibit a valid infinite path starting at 3 that avoids either event8 or event1 (or both).
- Consider the cycle 3 → 6 → 7 → 6 → 7 → ... :
  - 3 → 6 is allowed (from event3).
  - 6 → 7 is allowed (from event6).
  - 7 → 6 is allowed (from event7).
  - Repeating 6↔7 yields an infinite run that never visits event8 and never visits event1.
- Thus there is a valid execution in which event8 does not happen and event1 never happens. So C1 need not hold and C2 is not guaranteed.

(For completeness: C2 is satisfiable — e.g. 3 → 8 → 1 makes event8 happen and then event1 — but the hypothesis is not entailed.)

Final answer:
False
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event3 happens. From event3 one allowed next event is event8.
- After event8 one allowed next event is event1.
- Thus there is a valid sequence 3 -> 8 -> 1. That sequence makes ""event8 happens"" true and also makes ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) true.
- Therefore C2 (event8 happens and C1 holds) can be satisfied."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- The initial state has event1. The rules say: after event1, either event7 or event8 must happen next (exactly one of them).
- C2 asserts that in the next state C1 holds; C1 requires both event2 and event6 to happen.
- Since exactly one event happens in the next transition and that event must be either 7 or 8, it is impossible for both event2 and event6 to occur in that next state.

Therefore C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules say: after event1, either event7 or event8 must happen next (one of them).
- C2 asserts that in the next state both event2 and event6 happen.
- The next state is either event7 or event8, so it cannot be a state where both event2 and event6 occur.
Therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- We start with event1 having happened.
- The rules say: after event1, the next event must be either event7 or event8. So the immediate next state corresponds to either event7 or event8.
- C1 is the conjunction ""event2 happens and event6 happens"" — that requires both event2 and event6 to be true in the same state.
- In the immediate next state (after event1) the only possibilities are event7 or event8, so neither (and certainly not both) event2 and event6 can hold there.
Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event8 or event4"". C2 is ""event8 or C1"", which is logically equivalent to ""event8 or event4"" (same as C1).
- We must check whether event8 or event4 is forced from the initial event6 under the given transition rules.
- From event6 the allowed next events are {2,5,8,9}. To avoid 4 and 8 we can choose 2 (or 5 or 9).
- There is a closed set of states that avoids 4 and 8: {1,2,3,5,6,7,9}. Every event in this set has at least one outgoing transition that stays inside the set (e.g., 6→2, 2→1, 1→6), so we can loop indefinitely without ever visiting 4 or 8.
- Example cycle avoiding 4 and 8: 6 → 2 → 1 → 6 → ... . This never produces event4 or event8.
- Because there exists a valid sequence from the start that never makes event4 or event8 occur, C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event8 or event4"". C2 is ""event8 or C1"", which is equivalent to ""event8 or event4"" (so C2 = C1).
- Starting from event6, there is a path that never reaches event8 or event4: 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... .
  - 6 can go to 2 (allowed).
  - 2 can go to 3 (allowed).
  - 3 can go back to 6 (allowed).
  - None of these steps involve event4 or event8, and the cycle can repeat indefinitely.
- Because there exists a valid sequence avoiding both event8 and event4, the disjunction ""event8 or event4"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 = (event8) or (event4). C2 = (event8) or C1, so C2 simplifies to (event8) or (event4).
- We need to check whether, starting from the given initial event6 and following the allowed transitions, (event8) or (event4) must inevitably occur on every possible path.
- From event6 one allowed next event is event2. From event2 one allowed next event is event1. From event1 one allowed next event is event6. Thus there is a valid cycle 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 that can be repeated indefinitely.
- This infinite path never visits event8 or event4, so neither event8 nor event4 is forced to happen.
Therefore C2 is not guaranteed; the correct answer is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event6 happened.
- After event6, one option is event4 — choose that. So event4 happens (satisfies the second part of C2).
- After event4, event9 must happen — take event9.
- After event9, the choices are event4, event6, or event7. To keep event7 from happening (C1), always choose either event4 or event6.
- That yields a valid infinite (or finite) trace like 6 → 4 → 9 → 4 → 9 → 4 ... (or 6 → 4 → 9 → 6 → 5 → 6 → ...), in which event4 occurs and event7 never occurs.

Thus C2 (event7 does not happen AND event4 happens) can be satisfied, so the statement is True.
---
We must decide whether C2 (""event7 does not happen"" AND ""event4 happens"") is guaranteed by the given rules starting from the initial event6.

Look for a valid sequence consistent with the rules that violates C2. From event6 choose event5 (allowed). From event5 choose event1 (allowed). From event1 choose event2 (allowed). From event2 choose event3 (allowed). From event3 choose event7 (allowed). This yields the sequence:

6 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 7

This sequence is permitted by the rules and results in event7 occurring, so C1 (""event7 does not happen"") is false in at least one legal execution. Therefore C2 (C1 and event4 happens) cannot be guaranteed.

Final answer: False.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event6 happens (given).
- From event6 we may choose event4 (rule: after 6 either 4 or 5 must happen). Choosing 4 makes ""event4 happens"" true.
- After event4, event9 must happen. After event9, one of {4,6,7} must happen. To avoid event7, choose event4 (or 6) instead of 7.
- If we choose 4 again, we follow 4 -> 9 -> 4 -> 9 ... indefinitely. This satisfies ""event4 happens"" and never requires choosing event7.
- At every choice point we have alternatives that avoid event7 (e.g., from 9 choose 4 or 6; from 6 choose 4 or 5; from 5 choose 1,4,6,9; from 1 choose 2,5,8,9; from 2 choose 3,4,5,8,9 and can avoid 3 if desired; from 3 choose 5 rather than 7; from 8 go to 2 and then avoid 3). Thus there is a valid sequence with no event7.

Therefore C1 (no event7) and event4 happening can both hold; C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: C1 asserts ""Event9 does not happen"", but the context begins ""Initially, event9 happened."" That immediately falsifies C1 at the initial state. C2 claims C1 always holds; since C1 is already false initially, C2 cannot be true.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event9 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., at all times, event9 does not happen).

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event9 happened."" That directly contradicts C1.

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Since event9 did happen initially, the statement ""Event9 does not happen"" (C1) is false at the initial time.
- If C1 is false at any time, it cannot be true ""always."" Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event9 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., event9 never happens at any time.
- But the context explicitly states: ""Initially, event9 happened."" That directly contradicts C1.
- Since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 (that C1 always holds) cannot be true.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: event8 is the initial event, and the rules permit event4 immediately after event8 (""After event8, either event1, event2, event3, event4, or event9 must happen""). So there is a sequence where event4 occurs, hence C1 holds. Therefore C2 (that C1 does not hold) is false.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning: From the rules we can follow an infinite path that never visits event4: start at 8, choose 1 (allowed), then 1 forces 3, from 3 choose 8, and repeat: 8 → 1 → 3 → 8 → ... . This cycle never includes event4, so ""Event4 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary)
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as: on every possible future path from the current state, event2 eventually occurs.
- Initial state: event9 happened. From 9 the next event must be one of {3,4,7}.
- Counterexample path avoiding event2: 9 -> 3 -> 9 -> 3 -> ... (3 can go to 9, and 9 can go to 3). This infinite loop never produces event2, so C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., after one transition). But one possible next state is event3, and from event3 the same 3<->9 loop exists that avoids event2. Therefore C1 does not hold in that next state either.
- Hence C2 is False.
---
We interpret C1 as the claim ""event2 always happens"" (i.e., on every step/event in a run); C2 says that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., after the initial step).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the initial event9, the allowed next events are {3, 4, 7}.
- There exist choices that avoid event2 forever. For example:
  - 9 -> 3 (allowed)
  - 3 -> 1 (allowed)
  - 1 -> 6 (allowed)
  - 6 -> 5 (allowed)
  - 5 -> 3 (allowed)
  - and then the cycle 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 repeats indefinitely.
- This infinite cycle never includes event2, so there is a valid run in which event2 does not happen at all.

Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false. Since C1 is false already in some immediate successor (e.g., after taking 9 -> 3 we can follow the cycle above), C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at the initial event9. After 9 one allowed next event is 7.
- After 7 one allowed next event is 1.
- After 1 the allowed next events are {2,4,6}. If we always choose 6, and after 6 choose 1 (allowed by 6 → {1,5}), we get the infinite loop 1 → 6 → 1 → 6 → ... which never includes event2.
- Thus there exists a valid continuation from the initial state that never produces event2, so ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore ""C1 holds in the next state"" (C2) is also false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event7 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate next state both event7 and event1 occur.

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and transition rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule after event4: the next event must be one of {event1, event6, event9}.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- In the next state after the initial event4, only event1, event6, or event9 can occur.
- Event7 is not an option in that immediate next state, so it's impossible for both event7 and event1 to hold simultaneously in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From the rule ""After event4, either event1, event6, or event9 must happen,"" the next state must be one of {event1, event6, event9}.
- C1 requires both event7 and event1 to hold in that same next state. But event7 is not one of the allowed successors of event4, so event7 cannot occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- The initial event is event4.
- The rules say: after event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event6, event9}.
- C2 claims that in the next state both event7 and event1 happen (C1 holds).
- event7 is not among the allowed next events after event4, so event7 cannot occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning summary:
- C2 claims that in every possible future (from the initial event2) both event5 and event7 occur.
- From the rules: after event2 one may go to {4,5,9}; after event9 one may go to {2,3,4,5,8}; after event2 one may again go to 9, etc.
- A valid infinite path that avoids both event5 and event7 is: 2 → 9 → 2 → 9 → ... (repeating). Both transitions 2→9 and 9→2 are allowed, and this cycle never visits event5 or event7.

Since there exists a permitted sequence where C1 (events 5 and 7) does not hold, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
The hypothesis:
- C1: both event5 and event7 occur (at some point).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible execution from the initial state).

From the rules: after event2 you may go to event4, event5, or event9; after event9 you may go to event2 (among other options). So there is a valid execution that stays in the cycle 2 → 9 → 2 → 9 → ... and never visits event5 or event7. That execution violates C1, so C1 does not hold in all executions.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- From event2 one possible transition is to event4. From event4 one possible transition is to event9. From event9 one possible transition is back to event2. So there is a valid infinite cycle 2 → 4 → 9 → 2 → 4 → 9 … that never visits event5 or event7.
- C1 requires both event5 and event7 to happen. Because there exists a legal run that avoids both (hence does not satisfy C1), C1 does not hold in all runs.
- Therefore the claim ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event8 happens or event3 happens.
- C2: Event9 happens and C1 holds.

Step 2 — use the facts:
- Initially event8 happened, so C1 is true.
- From event8, one of {event2, event5, event9} must happen next. Event9 is an option but not forced.

Step 3 — show event9 is not inevitable:
- There is a valid sequence avoiding event9: 8 -> 2 (allowed from 8) -> 1 (allowed from 2) -> 8 (allowed from 1) and repeat. This cycle never includes event9, so event9 does not have to happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds, but C2 (which requires event9) does not necessarily hold. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 has happened, so C1 (event8 or event3) is already satisfied.
- C2 requires event9 to occur as well. From event8 the next event can be 2, 5, or 9. There are valid sequences that avoid event9 indefinitely (for example: 8 → 5 → 8 → 5 → 8 …), so event9 is not forced by the rules.
- Because event9 need not occur, C2 (event9 and C1) is not guaranteed by the context.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: event8 happens or event3 happens.
- C2: event9 happens and C1 holds.
We know initially event8 happens, so C1 is satisfied.

Step 2 — can event9 be forced to happen?
- From the rules: after event8 one of {2,5,9} must happen.
- But we can choose a path that avoids 9 forever, e.g.:
  8 -> 5 (allowed), 5 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 7 (allowed), 7 -> 5 (allowed), and repeat the cycle 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 5 ...
- None of the nodes 5,2,7 in that cycle require event9 as a next event, so event9 need not occur.

Conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence starting from the given initial event8 that never produces event9, event9 is not entailed by the premises. Therefore C2 (""event9 happens and C1 holds"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: Event7 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible future from the initial condition, event7 never occurs).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — extract relevant transitions from the context
- Initially event6 happened.
- After event6: one of {2, 3, 4, 5, 9} must happen.
- After event3: one of {2, 4, 5, 7, 9} must happen.
- (Also) after event5: one of {1, 2, 4, 7, 9} must happen.
- Other transitions are present but not needed for the counterexample.

Step 3 — construct a reachable sequence that produces event7
- Start: event6 (given).
- Choose event3 next (allowed from 6).
- After event3, event7 is one of the allowed next events.
Thus the sequence 6 → 3 → 7 is permitted by the rules, so event7 can occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid reachable sequence in which event7 happens, the claim ""event7 does not happen"" is not guaranteed, so C1 does not always hold.
- Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
C1: ""Event7 does not happen.""
C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible sequence, event7 never occurs).

From the rules (condensed):
- Start: event6.
- After 6 → {2,3,4,5,9}.
- After 5 → {1,2,4,7,9}.
- (Other transitions irrelevant for this counterexample.)

Trace a possible sequence: 6 → 5 → 7. Both transitions are allowed, so event7 can occur.

Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to hold in all sequences, so C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event7 does not happen."" C2 asserts C1 always holds (i.e., event7 never occurs in any allowed sequence).
- From the rules, initially event6 occurred. After event6 one of {2,3,4,5,9} must happen.
- If after 6 we choose event3 (allowed), then after event3 one of {2,4,5,7,9} must happen — so event7 can occur (6 → 3 → 7).
- Alternatively, after 6 we could choose event5, and after event5 one option is 7 (6 → 5 → 7).
- Therefore there exist valid sequences in which event7 occurs, so it is not true that event7 never happens.

Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start at event8. From the context, after event8 one possible next event is event6, and after event6 one possible next event is event8. So there is a valid infinite path 8 → 6 → 8 → 6 → ... that never visits event4 or event5.

C1 asserts that event4 or event5 happens. C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds. Since we have a possible (indeed valid) execution that avoids both event4 and event5 forever, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually occur. Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- We start at event8. From the transition rules, 8 -> {1,2,5,6}.
- We can choose 8 -> 6. From 6 -> {2,3,8,9} we can choose 6 -> 9. From 9 -> {4,5,6,7,8} we can choose 9 -> 8. This yields the cycle 8 -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 ...
- This cycle never visits event4 or event5, so there exists an infinite run in which C1 (event4 or event5 happens) never becomes true.
- Therefore it is not guaranteed that C1 eventually holds, so C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning / counterexample:
- C2 asks whether ""event4 or event5"" must eventually occur starting from the initial event8.
- From event8 choose event6 (allowed: after 8 → {1,2,5,6}).
- From event6 choose event2 (allowed: after 6 → {2,3,8,9}).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed: after 2 → {1,3,4,5,6,7,8}).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed: after 1 → {3,5,8,9}).
- From event3 choose event2 (allowed: after 3 → {2,4,5,7}).

This yields the loop 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 which can repeat forever; none of the events in this infinite path are 4 or 5. Therefore it is possible to avoid both event4 and event5 forever, so ""event4 or event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (concise):
- From the rules, after event4 the next event must be one of {event5, event7, event8} — event9 is not allowed immediately after event4.
- A concrete reachable sequence: event5 (initial) -> event2 -> event4. After event4 you can choose event5 (or 7 or 8), so event9 need not occur.
- Therefore the statement C1 (""If event4 happens, then event9 happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 claims: whenever event4 happens, event9 must happen later.
- From the context we can follow transitions; in particular:
  - 5 -> 2 is allowed (after initial event5).
  - 2 -> 4 is allowed.
  - 4 -> 5 is allowed.
  - 5 -> 2 is allowed again.
- Thus the cycle 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... is a valid infinite sequence that contains event4 but never visits event9.
- Because such a valid sequence exists, C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
We need to check whether C1 (""If event4 happens, then event9 happens"") holds given the transition rules starting from initial event5. C2 states that C1 does not hold.

Step-by-step:

- From 5 (initial) we may go to 2, 7, or 9. Choose 2.
- From 2 we may go to 1,3,4,5,6,8. Choose 4. So we reached event4 (so the antecedent of C1 can occur).
- From 4 the allowed next events are 5, 7, or 8. Choose 5.
- From 5 choose 7 (5 → 7 is allowed).
- From 7 choose 4 (7 → 4 is allowed).

This gives a cycle: 4 → 5 → 7 → 4 → ... which can be repeated forever and never includes event9. Since there is at least one possible continuation after event4 that avoids event9 indefinitely, the implication ""if event4 happens then event9 happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules.

Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e., in the next state either event3 occurs or event1 occurs)

Step 2 — examine the relevant conditions
- Initially event6 happened.
- From the rules: ""After event6, either event1, or event7 must happen."" So the next state after the initial event6 is either event1 or event7 (non-deterministically).

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- If the next state is event1, then C1 is true, so C2 holds.
- If the next state is event7, then C1 is false. Event3 is not one of the immediate choices after event6, so event3 does not occur in that next state (event3 could occur only after event7 in the following step). Thus in this branch, neither event3 nor event1 happens in the next state, so C2 is false.

Because there is a valid next-state choice (event7) that makes C2 false, C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Initially event6 happened.
- The rule after event6 says the next event must be either event1 or event7.
- C1 asserts ""event1 happens in the next state."" That is not guaranteed because event7 could occur instead.
- C2 asserts ""event3 happens or C1 holds"" in the next state. From the possible next events {event1, event7}:
  - If event1 happens next, C1 holds and C2 would be true.
  - If event7 happens next, then in that next state neither event1 nor event3 happen (event7 is the next event), so C1 is false and event3 is false, hence C2 is false.

Because there is a possible next-state (event7) that makes C2 false, C2 is not guaranteed. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify: C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state."" C2 = ""Event3 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — use the context: initially event6 happened. The rules say ""After event6, either event1 or event7 must happen."" So in the next state we have either event1 (making C1 true) or event7 (making C1 false).

Step 3 — counterexample: choose the branch where the next state is event7. Then in that next state event3 does not happen (the rule after event7 constrains the following state, not the immediate next), so C1 is false and event3 is false in the next state. Thus C2 (""event3 happens or C1 holds"") is false in this branch.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed; answer: False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does not necessarily happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and rules:
- Initially event8 happened.
- From event8, the rule says the next state must be one of {event2, event5, event7, event9}.

Step 3 — reason about necessity:
- The rule allows event2 but does not force it; the next state could be event5, event7, or event9 instead.
- Therefore ""event2 happens in the next state"" is not guaranteed.

Conclusion:
- C1 is not guaranteed, so ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is True.

Answer: True
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event8 occurred. The rules say after event8 the next event must be one of {event2, event5, event7, event9}. So event2 is a possible next event (C1 is possible) but not guaranteed. C2 asserts that event2 does not happen next; that is not entailed by the rules (since event2 could happen), so C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 happened.
- From the rule ""After event8, either event2, event5, event7, or event9 must happen,"" the next state is one of {event2, event5, event7, event9}.
- C1 asserts event2 happens in the next state; that is only one of several possible outcomes, not guaranteed.
- Therefore we cannot conclude C1 is false in all cases, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not entailed."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. (True because event2 happened initially.)
- C2: If C1 holds, then event9 happens (i.e., from event2, event9 must inevitably occur).

Step 2 — examine transitions (condensed):
- 1 -> {4,5,8}
- 4 -> {1,3,6,7,8}
- 5 -> {1,4,6,8}
- 8 -> {2,3,4,6}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,8,9}
- 6 -> {1,4,8}
- 7 -> {1,2,3,5}
- 2 -> {1,3,5,6,7,9}
- 9 -> {2,3,5,6}

Step 3 — reason about inevitability:
- From event2 you can choose event1 (since 2 -> 1).
- From event1 you can choose event4 (1 -> 4).
- From event4 you can choose event1 (4 -> 1).
Thus there is a cycle 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 ... reachable from the initial event2 that never visits event9.

Because at least one possible continuation from event2 avoids event9 forever, event9 is not inevitable given event2.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened, so C1 holds.
- The transitions (consolidated) are:
  - 1 → {4,5,8}
  - 2 → {1,3,5,6,7,9}
  - 3 → {1,2,4,8,9}
  - 4 → {1,3,6,7,8}
  - 5 → {1,4,6,8}
  - 6 → {1,4,8}
  - 7 → {1,2,3,5}
  - 8 → {2,3,4,6}
  - 9 → {2,3,5,6}
- From 2 we can choose successors that avoid 9. For example:
  2 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 2
  This cycle uses only {1,2,4,7} and never visits event9, so it can repeat forever.
- Therefore it is possible for event2 to occur (it already did) without event9 ever happening. The implication ""if event2 eventually happens then event9 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. (Given: initially event2 happened → C1 is true.)
- C2: If C1 holds, then event9 happens (i.e., from event2 occurring, event9 must eventually occur on every possible continuation).

Step 2 — relevant transitions (compact)
- After event2 → {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}.
- After event1 → {4, 5, 8}.
- After event8 → {2, 3, 4, 6}.
(Other transitions exist but these are enough.)

Step 3 — construct a counterexample run that avoids event9
- Start at event2 (given).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event8 (allowed).
- From event8 choose event2 (allowed).
This yields the cycle 2 → 1 → 8 → 2 → ... repeating forever, never visiting event9.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid continuation from event2 that never reaches event9, event9 is not forced by event2.
- Therefore the implication C2 is False.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1: ""Event9 happens in the next state.""
- Initially event4 happened. The rule for event4 says: after event4, either event5 or event9 must happen.
- So the next state could be event9 (or event5). Event9 is possible, hence C1 can be true.
- C2 is the negation of C1 (""C1 does not hold""). Because C1 might hold, C2 is not guaranteed true.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the context: initially event4 happened. After event4, either event5 or event9 must happen next.
- C1 says event9 happens next. That is possible given the rule.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event9 does not happen next). The context does not force event9 to be false (it allows event9), so C2 is not entailed.
- Therefore C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event4 happened, and the rules say that after event4 either event5 or event9 must happen. That leaves a possible next state where event9 happens, so C1 (event9 happens next) is possible. Therefore C2 (that C1 does not hold) is not entailed and cannot be concluded as true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Build the transition graph from the rules. Key edges: 4 -> {2,6,7}, 7 -> {6,9}, 6 -> {2,3,4,5,7,9}, 9 -> {1,5,7,8}, 8 -> {2,3,4,7}, etc. Initial event is 4.
- To show ""Event8 always happens"" false, it suffices to exhibit a possible infinite path that never visits 8. From 4 we can go 4 -> 7 -> 6 -> 4 and repeat this cycle forever. None of 4,7,6 include 8 in their outgoing choices on that cycle, so a run that never visits event8 exists.
- Therefore C1 (""Event8 always happens"") is false. C2 requires C1 to hold (and event2 to happen), so C2 is also false.

Hence the hypothesis C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C1: ""Event8 always happens"" (i.e., every possible sequence from the start eventually contains event8).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the transition rules and start
- From event4 (the start) there is a transition 4 -> 2 and 4 -> 6 and 4 -> 7.
- From event2 there is a transition 2 -> 4 (among others).
So 4 -> 2 -> 4 is a valid cycle.

Step 3 — reason about inevitability
- Because the cycle 4 -> 2 -> 4 can be repeated indefinitely, there exists a valid infinite sequence that never visits event8.
- Therefore event8 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible sequence; C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event2 can occur in some sequences).

Final answer:
False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 requires C1 (event8 always happens) to hold and also event2 to happen.
- From the rules, after event4 (the initial event) we may go to {2,6,7}. From 7 we can go to {6,9}. From 6 we can go to {2,3,4,5,7,9}.
- Consider the infinite execution that chooses 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 6 -> 7 -> 6 -> ... (i.e., 4 then repeatedly 6 and 7). All those transitions are allowed (6→7 and 7→6 are permitted), and this path never visits event8 (nor event2 or event9).
- Because there exists a valid execution that avoids event8, event8 is not guaranteed to always happen, so C1 is false. Therefore C2 (which requires C1) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to check whether every possible sequence starting from the initial event6 must eventually include event5.

Transitions (condensed):
- 6 -> {2, 8}
- 2 -> {4, 7, 8, 9}
- 4 -> {2, 3, 6, 9}
- 7 -> {1, 3, 4, 9}
- 8 -> {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- 1 -> {2, 6, 7}
- 3 -> {2, 6, 8, 9}
- 9 -> {2, 5}
- 5 -> {6, 7, 8, 9}

A single counterexample path that never visits event5 suffices to falsify ""Event5 always happens."" Starting at 6, take:
6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> ...
This is a valid infinite trace (2 -> 4 and 4 -> 2 are allowed) and it never contains event5. Therefore C1 (""Event5 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Counterexample: From the initial event6 take the choice 6 → 2. Then choose 2 → 4 and 4 → 2 repeatedly. This yields the infinite sequence 6,2,4,2,4,... which never visits event5. Hence ""event5 always happens"" is false, so C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Start at event6. From the rules: 6 -> {2, 8}.
- There is a cycle avoiding event5: 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... (2 -> 4 and 4 -> 2 are allowed). This infinite path never includes event5.
- Alternatively, 6 -> 8 -> 6 -> 8 -> ... is also an allowed infinite loop avoiding event5 (8 -> 6 is allowed).
- Because there exists a possible execution that never hits event5, ""Event5 always happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed. Therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event7 happens or event7 happens"", which simplifies to just ""event7 happens"".
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. ""event7 happens in the next state"".
- From the context, after event1 (the initial event) the next event must be one of {event4, event6, event7}. Since event4 or event6 could occur instead of event7, event7 is not guaranteed in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is not necessarily true (not entailed), so the correct answer is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event7 happens or event7 happens,"" which simplifies to ""Event7 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., that Event7 happens immediately after the initial state).
- Initially Event1 happened. The rules say: after Event1, the next event is either Event4, Event6, or Event7.
- Because the next event could be Event4 or Event6 (not necessarily Event7), Event7 is not guaranteed in the next state.

Therefore C2 is not necessarily true — answer: False.

C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., event7 happens immediately after the current state.

Initially event1 happened. The rule for after event1 is: either event4, event6, or event7 must happen next. That means event7 is possible but not guaranteed (the next event could be event4 or event6). Therefore C1 need not hold in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether C2 (""Event8 happens OR (Event9 happens AND Event4 happens)"") is guaranteed by the rules.

- Initially event4 has happened, so for C1 we would additionally need event9 to occur.
- C2 would be true if either event8 ever happens or event9 ever happens (since event4 already happened).

To show C2 is not guaranteed, give a valid infinite trace that never produces event8 or event9. From the rules one allowed cycle is:

4 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 7 → 6 → 5 → 1 → ...

Check each step against the rules:
- After 4: 1 is allowed.
- After 1: 3 is allowed.
- After 3: 2 is allowed.
- After 2: 7 is allowed.
- After 7: 6 is allowed.
- After 6: 5 is allowed (avoiding 8 and 9).
- After 5: 1 is allowed.

This loop contains no 8 or 9, so neither event8 nor event9 must ever occur. Thus C1 fails (event9 need not happen), and event8 also need not happen, so C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened, so C1 (event9 and event4) reduces to ""event9 happens"" because event4 is already true.
- From event4 one may go to 1,3,5,6, or 8. To show C2 need not hold, it suffices to exhibit a valid infinite sequence that never hits event8 or event9.
- Choose the transitions that avoid 8 and 9: 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... . All chosen successors are allowed by the rules and none are 8 or 9.
- In that sequence neither event8 nor event9 ever occurs, so C1 is false (event9 never happens) and event8 does not happen, hence C2 (""event8 or C1"") is false.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions: False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event4 has happened.
- After event4 one of {1,3,5,6,8} must happen. The choice is nondeterministic.
- There is a valid infinite trace that avoids both event8 and event9, for example:
  4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... 
  (5 can go to 2, 2 can go to 4, and 4 can go to 5 — all allowed by the rules).
- That trace never produces event8 or event9, so neither ""event8 happens"" nor ""event9 happens"" is guaranteed. C1 (event9 and event4) therefore does not necessarily hold, and C2 (""event8 happens or C1"") is not entailed.

Thus C2 is False."

Sample responses:
C1 asserts: whenever event7 occurs, event4 occurs (somewhere in the sequence). C2 asserts C1 always holds.

From the rules: initially event2 happens. After event2, event7 is an allowed next event. After event7, event3 is an allowed next event. After event3 no further events can occur.

So there is a valid sequence 2 → 7 → 3. This sequence includes event7 but never includes event4, so C1 is false in that run. Therefore C1 does not always hold.

Final answer: False

You're asking whether ""If event7 happens, then event4 happens"" holds in all allowed sequences.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the rules: initially event2 happens.
- After event2, one possible next event is event7 (allowed).
- After event7, one possible next event is event3 (allowed).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal), so event4 does not occur in that sequence.

This gives a valid sequence: event2 -> event7 -> event3, in which event7 occurs but event4 never does. Therefore the implication is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
We must decide whether ""If event7 happens, then event4 happens"" holds in all allowed sequences.

Look at the rules:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, either event3, event5, event7, or event8 must happen.
- After event7, either event3, event5, or event8 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal).

Construct a valid sequence: event2 → event7 → event3.
- event2 is allowed initially.
- After event2, event7 is an allowed next event.
- After event7, event3 is an allowed next event.
- After event3 the sequence ends.

This sequence contains event7 but never contains event4, so the implication ""if event7 happens, then event4 happens"" is not always true.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start from the initial condition: event5 happened.

From the rules: after event5, one of {event2, event3, event4, event8} must happen in the next state. So the next state can be event2, event3, event4, or event8.

C1 requires both event9 and event3 to happen. For C2 to be true, C1 must hold in the next state—i.e., in that next state both event9 and event3 would need to occur.

But the next state after event5 cannot be event9 (event9 is not among the allowed successors of event5). At best the next state can be event3, but not event9 simultaneously. Therefore it is impossible for both event9 and event3 to hold in that next state.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happens. From event5 the next event must be one of {2, 3, 4, 8}.
- C1 requires both event9 and event3 to have happened in that same (next) state.
- The transition rules are nondeterministic ""either/or"" choices producing a single event per step, so the next state can be at most one of {2,3,4,8}. It cannot contain both 3 and 9 simultaneously.
- (Note: you can get both events across two steps — e.g. 5 -> 3 then 3 -> 9 — but C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state, which is not the case.)

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially only event5 has happened.
- The rules say: after event5, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event8}.
- Therefore in the immediate next state we can have at most one of those events occur; event9 is not one of the allowed immediate successors of event5.
- C1 requires both event9 and event3 to have happened. That cannot be true in the next state (since event9 cannot occur there).
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C1: ""Event7 eventually happens.""  
C2: ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens.""

If C1 is true, that means event7 happens (at some point). Thus the implication ""if C1 then event7 happens"" is true (it is just asserting that from ""event7 eventually happens"" we can conclude ""event7 happens""). Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 states: ""Event7 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some point event7 occurs).
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens.""
- That is tautological: if ""event7 eventually happens"" is true, then ""event7 happens"" is necessarily true. The transition rules in the context are irrelevant to this logical implication.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reason: C1 asserts ""event7 eventually happens."" C2 is the implication ""if C1 holds, then event7 happens"" — that is P → P, which is always true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- From the initial event4, choose event6 (allowed).
- From event6 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event5 (allowed; the other choice would be event7, but we can avoid it).
- From event5 choose event9 (the only non-7 choice).
- From event9 choose event1 (allowed), and repeat the cycle 1 → 5 → 9 → 1 → ...

This infinite path 4,6,1,5,9,1,5,9,... never visits event2 and never visits event7, so C1 (event7 eventually happens) is false on this path and event2 never happens. Therefore the disjunction C2 (""event7 eventually happens OR event2 happens"") is not guaranteed — C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 says: ""Either event7 eventually happens (C1) or event2 happens.""
- To refute C2 it suffices to exhibit a possible infinite sequence from the initial event4 that never visits event7 and never visits event2.
- From the given transitions we can follow this cycle that avoids 2 and 7:
  4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 9 -> 8 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...
  (Check: 4→1 allowed; 1→5 allowed; 5→9 allowed; 9→8 allowed; 8→6 allowed; 6→3 allowed; 3→4 allowed.)
- This cycle repeats indefinitely and contains no event2 and no event7, so neither C1 nor event2 ever occurs on this run.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context; it is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C2 = (event7 eventually happens) OR (event2 happens).
- From the initial event4, there is a possible infinite path that never visits event2 or event7. For example:
  4 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 9 → 8 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 9 → 8 → ...
- Check transitions used: 4→6, 6→1, 1→5, 5→9, 9→8, 8→6 are all allowed by the rules. None of the states in this cycle are 2 or 7, so along this execution neither event2 nor event7 ever occurs.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (there exists a counterexample path), so C2 is False."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: From the initial event4, the rules allow event9 as a possible next event (after event4 either event1, event2, event5, event7, or event9 must happen). So a sequence can include event9 immediately. Therefore ""Event9 does not happen"" is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning: The sequence starts with event4, and the rules explicitly allow event9 immediately after event4 (""After event4 ... or event9 must happen""). So event9 can occur, meaning ""Event9 does not happen"" is not guaranteed to always hold. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event4 happens. The rule ""After event4, either event1, event2, event5, event7, or event9 must happen"" allows event9 immediately. So there is a possible sequence in which event9 occurs, meaning the statement ""Event9 does not happen"" is not true in all executions. Therefore C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 asserts: event5 happens and event3 happens.
- C2 asserts: if event3 happens then C1 holds — equivalently, if event3 happens then event5 happens (event3 on the right is redundant).
- From the rules we have the transitions:
  - 3 -> {1,4,5,7,9}
  - 1 -> {4,7,8,9}
  - 4 -> {3,5,7,9}
  (other rules exist but these are sufficient)
- Starting from the initial event3, one can follow 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 and repeat this cycle forever. None of those steps require event5.
- Thus there exists a valid sequence beginning with event3 in which event5 never occurs, so event3 does not imply event5 (and hence does not imply C1).
- Therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- C1 = (event5 happens AND event3 happens).
- C2 = (if event3 happens then C1 holds). Since the antecedent already contains event3, C2 effectively asserts: whenever event3 happens, event5 must also happen.

- From the context we know event3 happens initially. After event3 one may choose any of {1,4,5,7,9} — event5 is only one permitted option, not forced.

- Construct a valid run that contains event3 but never contains event5:
  1. Start at event3 (given).
  2. After event3 choose event1 (allowed).
  3. After event1 choose event8 (allowed).
  4. After event8 choose event2 (allowed).
  5. After event2 must go to event7 (forced).
  6. After event7 choose event1 (allowed).
  7. Repeat steps 2–6 to loop forever: 1 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 1 ...
  This infinite trace respects all “after” constraints and never includes event5.

- Because there exists a valid sequence where event3 occurs but event5 never occurs, the implication ""if event3 happens then event5 (and event3) happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is false.
---
C2 says: if event3 happens then C1 holds. Since C1 is ""event5 happens and event3 happens"", C2 is equivalent to: event3 ⇒ event5 (event3 ⇒ event3 is trivial).

We have the allowed transitions:
- 3 → {1,4,5,7,9}
- 1 → {4,7,8,9}
- 4 → {3,5,7,9}
(others omitted because not needed)

Starting from the initial event3, there is a valid sequence that never produces event5: 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → ... This cycle avoids event5 indefinitely. Therefore event5 is not forced by event3, so C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""  
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" So C2 asserts that in the state immediately after the initial one, event1 will occur in the following state (i.e., event1 occurs two steps from now).
- Initially event4 happened, so the next state must be event7 or event8 (from the rule after event4 → {7,8}).
- If the next state is event8, the following state can only be event6 or event9 (after event8 → {6,9}); neither is event1. Thus C1 is false in that next state, so C2 is false on that branch.
- Because there exists a permitted continuation (4 → 8 → ...) where C1 does not hold in the next state, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happens. The rules say after event4 the next event must be either event7 or event8. So in the next state event1 cannot be the event — C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is already not true.
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. that in that next state it will be true that ""Event1 happens in the (following) next state"" — equivalently, C2 asserts that event1 occurs two steps from the initial state.
- If the next state is event7, then the following state may be event1 (since event1 is one allowed successor of event7), but it is not forced (other successors are possible). If the next state is event8, then the following state must be either event6 or event9, so event1 cannot occur two steps out in that branch.
- Because event1 two steps out is not guaranteed (depends on nondeterministic choices and is impossible in the event8 branch), C2 does not necessarily hold.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- The context says initially event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, either event7, or event8 must happen"" means the next state after the initial event4 can only be event7 or event8.
- Neither event7 nor event8 is event1, so event1 cannot be the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false, and since C2 states that C1 holds in the next state, C2 is also false."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: start at the initial event9. After event9 we may choose event6. After event6 we may choose event9. Repeating 9 → 6 → 9 → 6 ... yields an infinite trace that never contains event8. Thus ""Event8 always happens"" (C1) is false, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

C2 is False.

Reasoning (counterexample): start at event9 (given). Take the choices
9 -> 6 (allowed), 6 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 4 (allowed), 4 -> 6 (allowed), and repeat the cycle 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 ...
None of these transitions require event8, so it is possible to run forever without event8 occurring. Thus ""Event8 always happens"" (C1) is false, and therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says ""Event8 always happens"" (i.e., at every step or in every run/event sequence).
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — so C2 is true only if C1 is true.
- From the context, the initial event is event9. After event9 the allowed next events are {1,5,6} — none of which is event8. So C1 already fails immediately (the initial-to-next step is not event8).
- There is also an infinite trace avoiding event8 entirely, for example:
  9 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...
  All transitions used are allowed by the rules, and event8 never occurs on this run.
- Therefore C1 is false, and so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning summary:
- C1 asserts ""Event9 always happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., event9 inevitably occurs on every possible future path).
- From the initial event5 we can follow the allowed transitions:
  5 -> 1 (allowed), 1 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 3 (allowed), 3 -> 1 (allowed), and repeat 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 ...
- This infinite cycle (5,1,2,3,1,2,3,...) never goes to event9, and every step uses a permitted successor.
- Therefore event9 is not guaranteed to occur on every possible path, so C1 does not always hold, and C2 is False.
---
We need to check whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 states ""Event9 always happens."" So C2 is true only if every possible sequence starting from the initial event(s) contains event9.

Find a counterexample path starting from the given initial event5 that never visits event9:

- From event5 you may go to event1 (allowed).
- From event1 you may go to event2 (allowed).
- From event2 you may go to event3 (allowed).
- From event3 you may go back to event1 (allowed).

Thus 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ... is a valid infinite sequence that never includes event9. Therefore event9 is not inevitable, so C1 is false. Consequently C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
You ask whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False.

- C1: ""Event9 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., that C1 is guaranteed by the rules).

We can refute C1 by exhibiting a valid sequence of events that never includes event9. From the context we have:
- Initially event5.
- After event5, event1 is allowed.
- After event1, event2 is allowed.
- After event2, event3 is allowed.
- After event3, event1 is allowed.

So one valid infinite cycle is: 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ... This sequence follows the given rules and never includes event9. Thus C1 (""Event9 always happens"") is false, and so C2 (that C1 always holds) is also false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event3 (given).
- From event3 one allowed next event is event5 (rule: after event3, either 1,4,5, or 6).
- From event5 one allowed next event is event3 (rule: after event5, either 3 or 8).
- So there is a valid infinite trace 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... that never produces event9 and never produces event1 or event7.
- C1 requires both event1 and event7 to happen; C2 requires event9 or C1. Since the trace above contains neither event9 nor both event1 and event7, C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 happens) AND (event7 happens).
- C2 = (event9 happens) OR C1.

We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed (i.e., follows from the given rules starting from initial event3).

Step 2 — examine transitions and look for a counterexample:
- From event3 one possible next event is event5.
- From event5 one possible next event is event3.
Thus there is a valid infinite run: e3 → e5 → e3 → e5 → ... 

This run never contains event9, and it never contains event1 or event7. Therefore C1 is false on this run, and event9 does not occur, so C2 is false on this run.

Conclusion:
Because there exists a valid execution starting from the initial event3 that makes C2 false, C2 is not guaranteed. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 says: ""Event9 happens or (Event1 happens and Event7 happens)"". We must decide whether C2 necessarily follows from the given rules starting with initial event3.

Step 2 — examine the rules and find a counterexample run
From event3 one allowed next event is event5 (3 → 5). From event5 one allowed next event is event3 (5 → 3). So a valid infinite run is:
3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ...
In that run neither event9 ever occurs nor do both event1 and event7 ever occur.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules that makes C2 false, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 claims: ""If event3 eventually happens (C1), then event4 happens.""
- We need only one allowed execution where event3 occurs but event4 never occurs to refute C2.
- Construct a valid trace from the given transitions:
  - Start at initial event8 (given).
  - 8 -> 6 (after event8, event6 is allowed).
  - 6 -> 3 (after event6, event3 is allowed). Now C1 holds (event3 has happened).
  - 3 -> 6 (after event3, event6 is allowed).
  - 6 -> 1 (after event6, event1 is allowed).
  - 1 -> 8 (after event1, event8 is allowed).
  - 8 -> 6, and repeat the cycle 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 6 -> ...
- This infinite loop (6,1,8,6,...) is permitted by the rules and never includes event4.
- Therefore there exists a run where event3 occurs but event4 never occurs, so C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (brief):
- C2 asserts: if event3 ever happens, then event4 will happen later (i.e., every run that reaches 3 must later reach 4).
- From the rules we have 8 -> {2,5,6,9}, 6 -> {1,2,3,5}, and 3 -> {2,6}.
- There is a cycle 6 -> 3 -> 6 that never visits 1,7,9 (the only events that can lead to 4), so once you choose those transitions you can avoid 4 forever.
- Concrete counterexample run: start at 8, choose 6 (8 -> 6), then 3 (6 -> 3). Now event3 has occurred, and then repeat 3 -> 6 -> 3 -> ... forever. Event4 never occurs on this run.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — understand the claim:
- C2 asserts: If event3 eventually happens (C1), then event4 happens (at some point afterward).

Step 2 — collect the relevant transitions (condensed):
- 8 -> {2,5,6,9}
- 6 -> {1,2,3,5}
- 3 -> {2,6}
- 1 -> {4,8,9}
- 4 -> {2,6,8}
- (others omitted because not needed)

Step 3 — show a counterexample path (starts at initial event8):
- From 8 you can go to 6 (8 -> 6).
- From 6 you can go to 3 (6 -> 3). So event3 does occur.
- From 3 you can go back to 6 (3 -> 6), and from 6 again to 3, etc. So you can loop 3 <-> 6 forever: 8,6,3,6,3,6,3,...
- This infinite path includes event3 but never includes event4.

Conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid sequence where event3 happens and event4 never happens, C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reason: From event2 we can choose event1 (allowed), and from event1 choose event2, and repeat this loop indefinitely (2 → 1 → 2 → 1 …). This avoids event4, event6, and event7, so C1 (""event4 or event6 happens"") and therefore C2 (""C1 and event7"") need not hold. Hence C2 is not guaranteed.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- We treat the rules as nondeterministic possible next events. To show C2 (which requires both ""event4 or event6 happens"" and ""event7 happens"") is entailed, it would have to hold on every possible continuation from the initial state (event2).
- Starting at the initial event2, one allowed next event is event5 (since after event2 we can have event1,3,5,6,8).
- From event5 we can go to event3 (allowed), and from event3 we can go back to event5 (allowed). So there is an infinite path 2 → 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → ... that never visits event4, event6, or event7.
- Because such a path exists, it is not guaranteed that ""event4 or event6 happens"" and that event7 happens. Therefore C1 need not hold, and hence C2 (""C1 holds and event7 happens"") is not entailed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context, ""After X, either A, B, ..."" means at least one of those must occur next, but it's non-deterministic which one.
- Starting at event2, choose event1 (allowed). From event1, choose event2 (allowed). Repeat 2 → 1 → 2 indefinitely.
- This infinite loop satisfies all ""after"" rules and never produces event4, event6, or event7.
- Therefore C1 (event4 or event6 happens) is not guaranteed, so C2 (C1 and event7) is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 says: whenever event6 happens, event8 happens. From the rules, after event6 the possible next events are {3,7,9} — 8 is not forced immediately. More importantly, there is a continuation that avoids 8 forever.
- Counterexample trace starting from the initial event4: 4 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 9 -> 5 -> 9 -> ... This cycle (5 ↔ 9) never visits event8, so event6 occurred but event8 never happens.
- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Counterexample: start at event4, take event4 -> event6 (allowed), then 6 -> 3 and 3 -> 6 (both allowed). Repeating 6 ↔ 3 yields a path where event6 occurs but event8 never occurs. Thus ""if event6 happens then event8 happens"" (C1) is false, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says: whenever event6 happens, event8 will happen later.
- From the rules: 4 -> {2,3,6,7,9}, so starting at initial event4 we can choose 4 -> 6 (so event6 can occur).
- From event6 the allowed next events are {3,7,9}. Choose 6 -> 3.
- From event3 the allowed next events are {1,4,5,6,9}. Choose 3 -> 6.
- This gives a valid infinite loop 6 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3 ... that never goes to event1 or event5 (the only events that can lead to event8).
- Thus it is possible for event6 to occur without event8 ever happening, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Interpretation: C1 = ""event9 happens in the next state (time 1)"". C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. at time 1 it is true that event9 will happen at time 2.

- From the context: initially event5 occurs. The rules say after event5 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event6, event7, event8}. Event9 is not in that set, so C1 (event9 at time 1) is not forced (indeed impossible) — so C1 is false at the initial state.

- For C2 we ask whether at time 1 it is guaranteed that event9 will occur at time 2. From event5 we can have time1 = event7 (allowed). After event7 the possible next events are {event4, event5, event8} — none is event9. Thus at time1 = event7, C1 (which would require event9 at time2) is false. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Because there is a valid sequence (event5 → event7 → not event9) that falsifies C2, C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happens, so the next state S1 must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event6, event7, event8}.
- C2 asserts that C1 (""event9 happens in the next state"") holds in S1; i.e., that in the state after S1 (call it S2) event9 necessarily occurs.
- But if S1 = event7 (allowed), then the possible S2 events are {event4, event5, event8}, none of which is event9. Thus event9 does not occur in S2 for that allowed choice of S1.
- Because there is an allowed next state (S1 = event7) that leads to a next state without event9, C2 is not guaranteed and is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""Event7 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event5 eventually happens"") can be satisfied starting from the initial condition.

From the context:
- Initially event8 happened.
- After event8, event7 is one allowed next event (since after event8, either event1, event2, event4, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen).
- After event7, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event5 is one allowed next event (since after event1, either event4, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen).

So there is a valid sequence: 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5. In that sequence event7 occurs, and later event5 occurs, so C1 holds and event7 happens. Therefore C2 is satisfiable.

Final answer:
True
---
The hypothesis C2 asserts both that event7 happens and that event5 eventually happens (C1).

From the context, the initial event is event8. From event8 we can go to event1. From event1 we can go to event4. From event4 we can go to event3. From event3 we can go back to event1. That gives the cycle 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 reachable from the start (8 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...). This infinite cycle avoids both event5 and event7, so neither event5 nor event7 is inevitable. Therefore C1 (event5 eventually happens) is not guaranteed, and thus C2 (event7 happens and C1 holds) is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False

We ask whether C2 (""event7 happens and event5 eventually happens"") is guaranteed given the rules and initial event8.

From event8 the allowed next events include 1,2,4,5,6,7,9. To show C2 is not guaranteed it suffices to give a valid infinite trace that never contains event7 or event5.

Construct this trace:
- Start: 8 (given).
- Choose 1 (allowed after 8).
- From 1 choose 4 (1 -> 4 is allowed).
- From 4 choose 3 (4 -> 3 is allowed).
- From 3 choose 1 (3 -> 1 is allowed).
- Repeat 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... forever.

All transitions used are allowed by the rules. This infinite trace never visits event5 or event7, so event5 does not eventually happen and event7 does not happen. Therefore C1 fails and C2 (which requires both event7 and C1) is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False"
