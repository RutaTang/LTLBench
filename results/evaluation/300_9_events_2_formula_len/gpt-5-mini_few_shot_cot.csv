1. C1 is the proposition ""event6 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e., either event6 or event2 holds in the current state).  
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalently: neither event6 nor event2 holds in the current state.

Reasoning (concise):
- From event4, possible next events are {event1, event6, event9}.
- Choose event1; from event1 possible next are {event2, ...}. Choose event2; from event2 possible next include event4.
- This yields a cycle: 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... which never visits event8.
- Because there exists a possible (infinite) future after event4 that avoids event8 forever, ""event8 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed when event4 happens.
- Therefore C2 (""If event4 happens, then event8 eventually happens"") is False."

1. C1 says ""Event8 always happens"" — i.e., event8 is true at every state.
2. Check whether that can occur given the transition rules. After event8, the allowed next events are {event4, event5, event6, event7} — event8 is not an allowed successor of event8.
3. Therefore you cannot have two consecutive states both with event8, so event8 cannot hold at every state. Also the initial state is event9, not event8, so C1 is impossible in any run.
4. If C1 is impossible (never true), then the implication ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"" is vacuously true.

- C1: ""Event9 happens and event6 happens"" — this requires both event9 and event6 to be true in the same state.
- In this model exactly one event holds per state (as in the examples), so C1 is impossible (always false).

Step 2 — check whether event7 can occur:
- Initially event3 holds.
- After event3, event1 can happen (3 -> 1).
- After event1, event7 can happen (1 -> 7).
- Thus there is a reachable state where event7 holds.

- We have a reachable state where event7 holds but C1 is impossible (false).
- Therefore the implication is false (there exists a state making antecedent true and consequent false).

Final answer: False"

1. C2 is the implication: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""
2. C1 is: ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., event9 is true in every state).
3. From the context: initially event9 happened, and after event9 one allowed next event is event1. So there is a valid run where event1 does occur.
4. If event1 occurs in a state, that state is not event9 (only one event holds per state), so ""event9 always happens"" is false in any run that contains an event1 state.
5. Therefore there exists a valid run where event1 happens but C1 is false, so the implication (If event1 happens then C1) does not hold universally.

1. C1 is ""event2 and event8 hold simultaneously."" In this system each state corresponds to one event happening, so two different events cannot both hold in the same state. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).

2. C2 is the implication ""if event3 happens, then C1 holds."" An implication with a true antecedent and false consequent is false.

3. From the initial state (event1), a next state event3 is allowed (after event1, event3 may happen). Thus there is a reachable state where event3 happens (antecedent true).

4. In that state C1 is false (see step 1), so the implication is false in that reachable state.

2. The context says: ""After event4, either event6, or event7 must happen.""

1. C1 is the implication: event2 -> event5, which is logically equivalent to (¬event2 ∨ event5).
2. C2 is: event5 ∨ C1. Substituting C1 gives: event5 ∨ (¬event2 ∨ event5) which simplifies to (¬event2 ∨ event5) — i.e., C2 is equivalent to C1.
3. We evaluate C2 in the initial state. The context says ""Initially, event9 happened"", so in the initial state event2 is false and event5 is false.
4. An implication (event2 -> event5) is true when the antecedent (event2) is false. Therefore C1 holds in the initial state.
5. Since C1 holds, C2 (event5 or C1) is true.

2. C2 is the implication: If C1 holds, then event5 happens.
3. From the context, initially event5 happened — so event5 is true in the actual run (at the initial state).
4. Therefore the consequent ""event5 happens"" is true in the model.
5. An implication is true whenever its consequent is true (or when the antecedent is false). Since the consequent is true here, the implication C2 is true.

1. C1 = ""Event6 always happens"" — that asserts event6 holds in the initial state (and in every state along every run).  
2. The context says the initial event is event3. So event6 does not hold in the initial state.  
3. Therefore C1 is false in the given system (indeed you can exhibit runs where states are not event6, e.g. initial event3 → choose event4).  
4. C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

As in the examples, only one event can be true in any single state. Therefore event5 and event6 cannot both be true in the same state, so C1 is impossible (always false in every state).

Step 3 — existence of a state with event5:

1. C1 is ""Event9 happens and event4 happens."" In this formalism each state/event label indicates a single event that happened at that state (only one event is true in any given state).
2. A conjunction ""Event9 and Event4"" would require a single state where both event9 and event4 are true simultaneously.
3. Because at most one event holds in any state, no state can make both event9 and event4 true at the same time.
4. Therefore C1 cannot hold in any state (C1 is always false).
5. C2 is ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is impossible, C2 is true.

3. Therefore C1 always holds (in every state), regardless of which event actually occurs.

2. C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" At the initial state event1 does not happen (event7 does), so the antecedent of the implication is false.

Reasoning:
1. C1 is the state formula ""if event5 happens then event9 happens"" (event5 → event9).
2. In any single state at most one event holds, so whenever event5 is false the implication is vacuously true.
3. The initial state has event1 true, hence event5 is false there, so C1 already holds in the initial state.
4. Therefore C1 holds at (at least) the initial state, so C1 eventually holds. Hence C2 is True."

1. C1 is the proposition ""Event5 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬Event5 holds in a state).  
2. The initial state is ""event6 happened"", so in the initial state Event5 is false — C1 holds at the initial state.  
3. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future state where C1 is true). Because C1 already holds in the initial state, C2 is satisfied.

- C1 = (event3 and event7) — this means event3 and event7 hold in the same state.
- C2 = (if C1 holds then event4 holds) — an implication about a single state.

Step 2 — single-event-per-state assumption:
- From the context and prior examples, each state corresponds to exactly one event happening at that time. Therefore two different events cannot be true simultaneously in the same state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Because event3 and event7 are distinct events, they cannot both hold in the same state, so C1 is never true in any state.
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C1 never holds, ""if C1 then event4"" is true in all states.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 asserts ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., every state/event must be event1). That is false in the initial state because initially event7 happened, not event1.
2. C2 is the implication: ""If event6 happens, then C1 holds."" For C2 to be true, every execution that ever reaches event6 would have to make C1 true (i.e., make event1 hold in all states).
3. Event6 is reachable from the initial state: 7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 6 is a valid sequence given the transition rules (7→3, 3→2, 2→6).
4. In that execution event6 occurs, yet C1 is still false (the initial state is event7, not event1), so the implication fails.
Therefore C2 is False."

1. Initial state: event4 happened.  
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — so we must check all immediate successors of the initial state.  
3. From event4, the rules say the next event must be either event3 or event8. So the possible next states are: event3 and event8.  
4. C1 is the proposition ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event1 -> event2). In a state where a different event holds, the antecedent (event1) is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).  
5. In the event3 state: event1 is false, so C1 holds.

1. C1 is ""Event9 does not happen"" — interpreted as ""in the current state, event9 is false.""
2. C2 is ""Event8 happens and C1 holds"" — so C2 holds in a state iff that state has event8 and does not have event9.
3. The context states: ""Initially, event8 happened."" In that initial state event8 is true.
4. In any single state only one event holds, so in the initial state event9 is false.

Since at most one event holds in a state, any state with event9 true would make C1 false; if event9 never occurs then C1 is vacuously true.

2. C2 is ""if event8 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. (event8 → C1), evaluated in the initial state unless otherwise specified.

1. We evaluate the formulas at the initial state (as in the examples). Initially, event2 happened — so in the initial state event2 is true and all other event propositions (event1, event3, ..., event9) are false.

2. C1 is ""Event9 does not happen"" — i.e., event9 is false in the current state. At the initial state event9 is indeed false, so C1 holds.

3. C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e., event3 is true OR (event9 is false). In the initial state event3 is false but C1 is true, so C2 is true.

2. The context states ""Initially, event5 happened."" So the initial state is event5, not event4.
3. Therefore C1 cannot hold in any run (the antecedent of C2 is impossible/false because the initial state is not event4).

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""if event9 happens then event8 happens"" (i.e. event9 -> event8).
- C2 is ""if C1 holds then event3 happens"" (i.e. C1 -> event3).
- From the context, initially event9 happens, and after event9 one possible next state is event1 (since after event9 either event1, event3, or event6 must happen).
- In the event1 state, event9 is false, so C1 (event9 -> event8) is true there (an implication is true when the antecedent is false).
- In that same event1 state, event3 is false.
- Thus there is a reachable state where C1 is true but event3 is false, so C2 is false (the implication C1 -> event3 is violated).
Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the examples and the problem framing, an ""eventX"" proposition means that the current state is labeled with eventX, and at any single state only one event holds. (This is the interpretation used in the examples.)

2. C1 is the conjunction ""event6 happens and event2 happens"" — that requires a single state in which both event6 and event2 are true simultaneously.

3. Because at most one event can hold in any state, no state can make both event6 and event2 true at the same time. So C1 is impossible (always false).

4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e., the negation of an always-false statement. Therefore C2 is true."

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 is the state-formula ""if event5 then event8"" (i.e. event5 ⇒ event8).
- In these models exactly one event holds in a state, so whenever event7 holds in a state, event5 is false in that same state.
- If the antecedent of an implication (event5) is false, the implication is true (vacuously).
- Thus in every state where event7 holds, C1 holds; in states where event7 does not hold the implication C2 (event7 ⇒ C1) is also true.
- Therefore C2 is true in all states."

1. Initially event9 happened (so event9 is true at the initial state; other events are false there).
2. C1 is ""event5 happens or event4 happens."" At the initial state neither event5 nor event4 holds.
3. Therefore C1 is false at the initial state.
4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — hence C2 is true at the initial state.

1. C2 is the implication: (event5) → (event7 or event3). That is, whenever a state has event5, the same state must have event7 or event3.  
2. Exactly one event holds in any given state, so event5, event7, and event3 cannot be true simultaneously in the same state.  
3. From the context: initially event9, and after event9 one allowed successor is event5. So a state with event5 is reachable.  
4. In that event5 state the antecedent (event5) is true but the consequent (event7 or event3) is false. Thus the implication is false in that reachable state.

Therefore C2 is False."

- C1 is ""Event5 and Event5"", which simplifies to ""Event5"".
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then Event5 happens"", i.e. ""If Event5 then Event5"".
- The implication p → p is always true in every state, so C2 is true."

1. C1 is the proposition ""event9 happens or event7 happens"" (i.e., the current state is event9 or event7).
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not(event9 or event7) in the current state).
3. The context says ""Initially, event5 happened"" — the initial state is event5.
4. In the initial state event9 is false and event7 is false, so C1 is false there.
5. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is true in the initial state.

1. C1 is ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event2) — this is a statement about a single state.  
2. C2 is ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., event3 → ¬event2, also a state-level implication.  
3. From the model semantics used in the examples, exactly one event occurs in any given state (events are mutually exclusive).  
4. Therefore, in any state where event3 is true, event2 must be false, so ¬event2 holds in that state.

1. Initial state: event3 happened.  
2. After event3, the rules force the next event to be either event1 or event9 (no option to have event4 next).  
3. C1 is the statement ""if event4 happens, then event9 happens"" (i.e., event4 => event9). An implication is true whenever the antecedent (event4) is false.  
4. In both possible immediate successors (event1 or event9), event4 is false, so event4 => event9 holds in each successor state.  
5. Therefore C1 holds in the next state (in every possible next state). Hence C2 is True.

</graphml>",1.0,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1. C1 is the state formula: (event4 -> event5) — in a single state, if event4 is true then event5 must be true.
2. C2 is the state formula: (event8 -> C1), i.e. in any state where event8 is true, C1 must hold in that same state.
3. In this model each state corresponds to a single event happening (only one event can be true in a state). Thus in any state where event8 is true, event4 is false.
4. If event4 is false, the implication (event4 -> event5) is vacuously true.
5. Therefore whenever event8 holds, C1 holds, so C2 is true.

1. The model describes a sequence of single events: initially event8 holds, and after each event exactly one of the listed next events must happen. So in any given state exactly one event is true.
2. C1 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" — i.e., it requires event1 and event2 to be true in the same state.
3. Because only one event can be true in a state, event1 and event2 cannot be true simultaneously in any state.
4. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).
5. C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is true.

Reasoning:
1. Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
2. C1 is ""event8 happens or event5 happens"" — i.e. event8 ∨ event5 at the current state.
3. At the initial state only event1 is true (events are mutually exclusive in a state), so event5 and event8 are false there.

1. C1 is ""Event4 happens and event8 happens"" — interpreted as both events being true in the same state (consistent with the examples where a conjunction of events requires simultaneity).

2. In this event model, at any given state exactly one event holds (events are mutually exclusive per state). Thus no single state can have both Event4 and Event8 true simultaneously.

3. Therefore C1 is impossible (false in every state).

4. C2 is the negation of C1 (""C1 does not hold""), so C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event5 happened.
2. The rules say: after event5, either event3 or event9 must happen (repeated several times but consistent).
3. Therefore the immediate next state is either event3 or event9.
4. In both cases, event8 does not happen in that next state.
5. C1 is ""event8 does not happen"". Thus C1 holds in the next state.
6. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"", so C2 is True."

1. C1 is ""Event6 happens and event5 happens"" — this requires a single state in which both event5 and event6 are true simultaneously.  
2. As in the examples, the model of the context assumes exactly one event holds in any given state (events label states and transitions pick the next single event). Thus two different events cannot hold at the same time in one state.  
3. Therefore no state can make (Event6 AND Event5) true, so C1 is impossible.

1. C1 is ""Event5 does not happen.""
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one, Event5 does not occur.
3. The context states: ""After event5, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen.""
4. The initial state is event5. Therefore the next state must be one of {event1, event4, event6, event7}.
5. None of those is event5, so in the next state Event5 does not happen.
6. Thus C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

1. Interpret C1: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens."" In any single state this is (event5 -> event1). Since only one event can hold per state, C1 is false exactly in states where the current event is event5; in every state where the current event is not event5, C1 is true.

2. Interpret C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" This is (C1 -> event4). So C2 would require that in every reachable state where C1 is true, the current event must be event4.

3. From the context: initial state is event4, and from event4 a next state event3 is allowed (after event4, either event3, event5, event7, or event9 must happen). So event3 is reachable.

4. In the reachable state event3: C1 holds (because the current event is not event5), but event4 does not hold (the current event is event3). Therefore C1 true while event4 false, which is a counterexample to C2.

5. Hence C2 is not universally true in the system.

1. C1: ""Event8 does not happen"" means a single state where event8 is false.
2. Initially event8 happened (initial state has event8 = true).
3. The rules say: after event8, the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event5, event6, event7, event9} — event8 is not among them.
4. Therefore the immediate next state after the initial state has some event ≠ event8, so C1 holds in that next state.

1. C1 is ""event2 or event3"".
2. C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"", i.e. event2 -> (event2 or event3).
3. For any proposition p and q, p -> (p or q) is a tautology: whenever p is true, p or q is necessarily true; if p is false the implication also holds.

1. C2 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" C1 is ""Event4 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., both in the same state).

2. In this setting, each state records a single event occurrence (as in the examples). Thus two different events cannot both be true in the same state.

3. Therefore C1 (event4 and event1 simultaneously) is impossible — C1 is always false in every state.

4. A conditional with a false antecedent is vacuously true. So ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" holds in all states.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the state formula (event8 ⇒ event4). An implication holds in a state whenever event8 is false in that state or event4 is true in that state.
2. Initially event8 is true, so C1 is false in the initial state (event4 is not true initially).
3. From the context, after event8 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6, event7} — none of these are event8.
4. Therefore, in the immediate next state event8 is false, so the implication (event8 ⇒ event4) is true there.
5. Hence there exists a future state where C1 holds, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is True."

Reasoning:
1. C1 is ""Event6 happens and Event8 happens"" — this requires both events to be true in the same state.
2. The context describes a system where each step exactly one event happens (after each event, one of the listed single events must occur). There is no possibility for two different events to be true simultaneously in a single state.
3. Therefore C1 cannot hold in any state (it is impossible for event6 and event8 to hold together).
4. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

</graphml>",1.0,"Let's reason step by step.

1. C1 is the state formula: (event5 → event3). An implication is false only when event5 is true and event3 is false in the same state. Since exactly one event holds in any state, in any state where event5 holds, event3 does not hold, so C1 is false exactly in event5 states; in every non-event5 state C1 is true.

2. The initial state is event1 (given). In that initial state event5 is false, so C1 holds immediately in the initial state.

3. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there exists some current or future state where C1 is true). Since C1 already holds in the initial state, C2 is satisfied.

1. C1 is ""Event8 does not happen.""
2. Initially, event9 happened — so in the initial state event8 is false (event8 does not happen).
3. Therefore C1 already holds in the initial state.
4. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds now (the initial state counts as a time at which it holds), C2 is true.

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — interpret the formulas:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e., from a given state, at some future state event2 occurs).
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — meaning: whenever event3 occurs at some state, from that state event2 must eventually occur.

Step 2 — relevant transitions (given):
3 -> {2,9}
9 -> {1,5,7}
7 -> {1,8,9}
1 -> {2,3,5,6,9}
(and others, but these suffice)

Step 3 — exhibit a counterexample run reachable from the initial state:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- From 2 choose 1 (2 -> 1).
- From 1 choose 3 (1 -> 3). So event3 happens and is reachable.
- From 3 choose 9 (3 -> 9).
- From 9 choose 7 (9 -> 7).
- From 7 choose 9 (7 -> 9).
Now we can loop 9 -> 7 -> 9 forever. This cycle contains no event2, so after reaching event3 we can follow a path where event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because there is a reachable execution where event3 happens and yet event2 never occurs afterwards, C1 does not necessarily hold after event3. Therefore the implication C2 is false.

1. C1 is the state formula: ""If event5 happens, then event3 happens."" That is logically (event5 → event3), which is equivalent to (¬event5) ∨ event3.

2. In these problems exactly one event holds in each state. So in any state where event5 holds, event3 does not hold, making the implication false. Therefore C1 is false exactly in states labeled event5, and true in every state that is not event5.

3. The initial state is event3 (given in the context). In that state event3 holds, so C1 is true at the initial state.

4. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 already holds in the initial state, C2 is true.

2. Events are mutually exclusive, so event7 and event5 cannot both be true in the same state. Thus C1 is false exactly in states where event7 happens; in every other state C1 is true.
3. Initially event1 happened, so in the initial state event7 is false.
4. Therefore C1 already holds in the initial state.

1. C1 is the proposition ""event4 happens or event5 happens"" (a state formula).
2. The initial state has event9 true (only event9 holds initially).
3. Therefore in the initial state both event4 and event5 are false, so C1 is false in the initial state.
4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — so C2 is true in the initial state.

(If C2 were intended to mean ""C1 never holds"" then it would be false, because after event9 occurs the next state must be event4. But reading C2 as written as a current-state negation, the correct answer is:)

Reasoning (concise):

- After event4, the next state must be one of: event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, or event9.
- None of these is event1, so in the next state event1 does not happen.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the implication: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds.""
2. C1 is ""Event7 does not happen"" (i.e., in the same state, event7 is false).
3. In this model exactly one event holds in each state, so event3 and event7 cannot both be true in the same state.
4. Therefore whenever event3 holds in a state, event7 does not hold in that same state, so C1 holds whenever event3 holds.
5. Thus the implication (event3 → C1) is true (in fact true in every state)."

2. In this transition system each state corresponds to a single event being true — you cannot have two different events true in the same state.

- C2 is the negation: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., it is not the case that event7 holds in all states.

Step 2 — use the context:
- The initial state is event5. In that state event7 is not true.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Because event7 is not true in the initial state, C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event3 happens and Event4 happens"" — i.e., both events hold in the same state.
2. In this model each state records exactly one event (transitions list a single next event choice), so two distinct events cannot be true simultaneously in the same state.
3. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).
4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of an impossible statement — so C2 is always true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the statement ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"", where C1 is ""event3 and event1"" (both must hold in the same state).
2. From the context, exactly one event holds in any given state (as in the examples), so C1 (event3 AND event1 in the same state) is impossible — no single state can have both event1 and event3 true.
3. Check reachability of event7 from the initial state: initially event8 holds. After event8, event1 can happen (8 -> 1), and after event1, event7 can happen (1 -> 7). Thus event7 is reachable.
4. Therefore there exists a reachable state where event7 holds but C1 is false. Hence the implication ""if event7 then C1"" is false.

So C2 is False."

2. The context describes deterministic transitions where, after any event, one of a listed set of next events happens. As in the examples, this means exactly one event holds at each state (events are mutually exclusive).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., in every state).
2. Initially event9 is true.
3. The context says: after event9, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5, event8} — none of which is event9. So the very next state after the initial state can (and must) be a non-9 event.
4. Therefore event9 does not hold in that next state, so C1 is false.
5. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — hence C2 is true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the state formula (event7 -> event4). This is false exactly in states where event7 is true and event4 is false; it is true in any state where event7 is false (implication vacuously true) or event4 is true.
2. The initial state has event7 true and (since only one event holds per state) event4 false, so C1 is false initially.
3. From event7, the context requires the next event to be one of {event3, event5, event8, event9} — none of which are event7.
4. In any of those next states event7 is false, so C1 holds there.
5. Therefore there is a future state where C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 states ""Event4 does not happen"" as a proposition about the current state (i.e., event4 is false in that state).
2. C2 is the implication ""If event1 happens (in the current state), then C1 holds (i.e., event4 is not happening in that same state).""
3. The model assumes exactly one event holds in each state, so event1 and event4 cannot be true simultaneously in the same state.
4. Therefore whenever event1 holds, event4 does not hold in that same state, so the implication in C2 is always satisfied.

Thus C2 is True."

1. Treat each ""eventX happens"" as the atomic proposition true exactly in states labeled X (states are mutually exclusive: only one event holds per state).
2. C1 is the state formula (event7 → event8), i.e. ¬event7 ∨ event8. In any state where event7 is false, C1 is true; C1 is false only in a state where event7 is true and event8 is false.
3. C2 is (event3 → C1). In any state where event3 is true, event7 is necessarily false (because exactly one event holds), so C1 is true in that state. If event3 is false the implication holds vacuously.
4. Therefore C2 is true in every state (including reachable ones from the initial event9).

Reasoning (step by step):
1. C1 asserts ""event5 and event6"" hold in the same state. As in the examples, at any single state only one event can be true, so C1 is impossible (false in every state).
2. C2 is the implication ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" An implication is false in any state where the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.
3. From the context: initially event8 happens, and after event8 either event1 or event2 must happen. So there is a reachable state where event1 happens.
4. In that state event1 is true but C1 is false (by step 1), so the implication fails there.
5. Therefore C2 does not hold (is false)."

1. C1 is: event2 OR event1.
2. C2 is: if event1 happens, then C1 holds — i.e. event1 → (event2 OR event1).
3. If event1 is true, then (event2 OR event1) is true (because event1 is true).
4. If event1 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Reasoning (concise):
- C2 means: whenever event9 happens now, then event8 must happen in the next state.
- But the rules for ""after event9"" allow event5, event6, or event8 — event8 is not forced.
- Construct a valid trace: initially event4 → (choose) event2 → (choose) event9 → (choose) event5. All choices are allowed by the context.
- In that trace, event9 occurs but the next state is event5 (not event8), so C1 is false there and the implication fails.

Therefore C2 is False."

1. C2 is the implication: ""If event9 happens, then event5 does not happen"" (i.e., event9 -> (event5 never happens)).
2. Initially event2 happened.
3. From event2 one possible next event is event9 (after event2, either 1, 4, 6, or 9 must happen).
4. From event9 one possible next event is event5 (after event9, one option is event5).
5. Thus there is a valid run: event2 -> event9 -> event5, in which event9 happens and event5 also happens.
6. In that run the antecedent (event9 happens) is true but the consequent (event5 does not happen) is false, so the implication fails.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event5 happened.
2. C1 is ""Event8 does not happen"" — in the initial state the current event is event5, so event8 is not happening there. Thus C1 is true in the initial state.
3. C2 is ""C1 holds or event7 happens"". Since C1 is already true in the initial state, C2 is true (regardless of event7).
4. Therefore C2 is True."

- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In a single state this is equivalent to (not event1) OR event2.
- Events are mutually exclusive (only one event can hold in a state), so any state where event1 holds cannot have event2 simultaneously; thus C1 is false exactly in states where event1 holds, and true in every state where event1 does not hold.
- The initial state is event6, so event1 does not hold there, hence C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 already holds at the initial state, C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., event9 holds in every state).
2. From the context, initially event7 happens. After event7, either event2 or event8 may happen — so there is a possible next state with event2.
3. After event2, the allowed next events include event1, event4, event5, event6, event7, event8, or event9. These choices are nondeterministic, so event9 is not forced.
4. Consider the trace: initial event7 -> choose event2 -> then choose event1. At the state with event1, event9 does not hold, so ""event9 always happens"" (C1) is false on that trace.
5. Because there exists a possible execution in which event2 happens but C1 does not hold, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.
6. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the formula (C1 -> event7). This is logically equivalent to (not C1) OR event7.
2. We evaluate C2 in the initial state. The context states ""Initially, event7 happened,"" so event7 is true in the initial state.
3. Since event7 is true in the initial state, the disjunction (not C1) OR event7 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
4. Therefore C2 is true."

1. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., event1 must be true in every state).
2. The initial state is event7 (given).
3. In the initial state event1 is not true (because event7 holds).
4. Therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false.
5. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.

1. Interpret the formulas as state propositions (no temporal operator present).  
   - C1 is the state implication: (event3 → event6). It is false only in a state where event3 is true and event6 is false.  
   - C2 is the state implication: (event9 → C1), i.e. in any state where event9 holds, C1 must hold in that same state.

2. In this model, exactly one event holds in any given state (events are mutually exclusive), so in a state where event9 holds, event3 cannot hold simultaneously.

3. Therefore in any state with event9, the antecedent of C1 (event3) is false, so C1 (event3 → event6) is vacuously true in that state.

4. Hence whenever event9 happens, C1 holds. So C2 is true.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because the initial state is event9, not event2, so event2 does not hold in all states.
- C2 is the implication ""if event7 happens, then C1 holds."" For this implication to be true in the model, every run where event7 occurs would have to satisfy C1.
- From the initial state we can go 9 -> 4 -> 7 (since after 9 you can go to 4 and after 4 you can go to 7), so there is a run where event7 occurs.
- In that run C1 is false (as noted), so the implication fails.
Therefore C2 is False."

1. C2 says: ""If event4 happens, then event8 eventually happens."" So we must check whether every possible future after event4 is guaranteed to reach event8.

2. From the context, after event4 the allowed next events are: {event1, event3, event6, event8, event9}. So event8 is one possible next event, but not the only one.

3. To refute the implication we only need one possible infinite path starting from event4 that never visits event8. Check whether such a path exists.

4. Consider the transitions (omitting 8):
   - event4 → event1
   - event1 → event2
   - event2 → event3
   - event3 → event1
   This gives the cycle 4 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ... which never visits event8.

5. Since after event4 the system can follow the cycle 1 → 2 → 3 indefinitely, avoiding event8 forever, event8 is not guaranteed to eventually happen whenever event4 happens.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens and Event5 happens"" — interpreted as both events being true in the same state.
2. As in the examples, at most one event can hold in any single state (events are mutually exclusive).
3. Therefore it is impossible for Event1 and Event5 to be true simultaneously in one state, so C1 cannot hold.
4. C2 states ""C1 does not hold"", which is thus true."

- C1 = ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., event4 is true in every state).
- C2 = ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., on any execution where event7 occurs, event4 must hold always).

Step 2 — check C1 in the system:
- The initial state is event1, so event4 is not true in the initial state. Therefore C1 is false (event4 is not true in every state).

Step 3 — check C2:
- From the initial state (event1) a transition to event7 is allowed (after event1, event7 may happen). So there is an execution where event7 happens.
- On that execution, the antecedent of C2 is true (event7 happens) but the consequent C1 is false (event4 is not true in all states, e.g. initial state is event1). Hence C2 is false.

1. C1 is the proposition ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., in a given state, event3 is false).
2. The initial state is ""event8 happened"" — so in that initial state event3 is false, hence C1 holds in the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., in every state event2 is true).
2. The context states the initial event is event1, so the initial state is not event2.
3. Therefore C1 is false in this model (it cannot be that event2 holds in every state).
4. C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event6 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true (there is no case where C1 holds and event6 fails).

1. C1 is: Event6 happens or Event2 happens. (C1 = Event6 ∨ Event2)
2. C2 is: If Event6 happens, then C1 holds. So C2 is: Event6 → (Event6 ∨ Event2).
3. For any proposition A and B, A → (A ∨ B) is a tautology: if A is true, then A ∨ B is necessarily true; if A is false, the implication is also true.
4. Therefore C2 is always true regardless of the context or event sequences.

Reasoning:
1. The implication (event9 or event5) -> event9 is false exactly when event5 is true and event9 is false in the same state.
2. From the context: Initially event1 happened, and ""After event1, either event3, event4, or event5 must happen."" So a next state with event5 is reachable.
3. In a state where event5 happens, event9 is not happening (only one event holds in a state), so C1 holds (because event5 is true) but event9 does not hold.
4. Therefore the implication is false in that reachable state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The initial event is event1.
2. C2 is the conjunction: (C1 holds) AND (event9 happens).
3. At the initial state, event9 does not happen (event1 is true instead), so the second conjunct is false.
4. Even though C1 (the implication ""if event8 then event4"") is vacuously true at the initial state (because event8 is false), the conjunction with a false second conjunct makes C2 false at the initial state.

1. C1 says: ""Event9 does not happen.""
2. C2 says: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state along every possible execution, event9 never happens.
3. The initial state has event1.
4. The context includes: ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen.""
5. That rule allows event9 to occur immediately after the initial state (there is a possible transition to event9).
6. Therefore there exists a path where event9 does happen, so C1 does not hold on that path and is not a global invariant.
7. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

2. The model here (as in the examples) has exactly one event true per state (events are exclusive).

- Initially only Event3 holds. Event9 does not hold in the initial state.
- A conjunction is false if either conjunct is false, so C2 is false at the initial state.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 holds.
- From event1, one allowed next event is event9 (after event1, either event2, event4, event7, or event9 must happen).
- Therefore event9 can happen (immediately), so ""Event9 eventually happens"" (C1) can be satisfied.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event9 never happens). Because event9 is possible from the initial state, C2 is false."

1. C1 is ""Event8 happens and event8 happens"", which is equivalent to just ""Event8 happens"" (event8).
2. C2 is ""C1 always holds"", i.e. event8 holds in every state (including the initial state).
3. The context says ""Initially, event3 happened"" — the initial state is event3, not event8.
4. Therefore event8 is false in the initial state, so C1 does not hold initially.
5. Since C1 fails in the initial state, C2 (""event8 always holds"") is false.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" means at some state s, every state from s onward must have event1.
- For C1 to hold at any state s, s must be event1 and every successor state must also be event1.
- But after event1 the next event must be one of {event4, event5, event7, event8, event9} (no event1 successor).
- Therefore there is no state from which event1 holds in all future states, so C1 never holds.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False."

1. Initial state: event2 happened.  
2. C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is ""event8 or event6."" So C2 requires that the immediate next event is either event6 or event8.  
3. From the context: after event2, the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event5, event6, event9}.  
4. That set includes event6 (which would make C1 true) but also includes event1, event4, event5, and event9 (which do not make C1 true).  
5. Because a next state with event1 (for example) is allowed, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true.

1. Initial state: event4 happened (so in the current state event4 is true and event1 is false).
2. C1 is a propositional statement ""if event8 happens, then event4 happens"" evaluated in the current state (i.e., event8 -> event4 in this same state).
3. C2 is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — both conjuncts must be true in the current state.
4. In the current state event1 is false (initially event4 happened, not event1), so the conjunct ""Event1 happens"" is false.

</graphml>",1.0,"Let's reason step by step.

1. C1 states: ""Event5 eventually happens"" (i.e., on every allowed future from the initial state, event5 will occur at some point).
2. The transitions given include:
   - From event1 -> {2,3,4,5,6,7}
   - From event3 -> {2,4}
   - From event2 -> {3,5,6,7,8}
   (Other transitions exist but these are enough.)
3. Starting at the initial event1, we may choose the successor event3 (allowed).
4. From event3, we may choose event2 (allowed).
5. From event2, we may choose event3 (allowed).
6. Thus there is a valid infinite trace: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... that never visits event5.
7. Because such a trace exists, event5 is not guaranteed to eventually occur from the initial state. Therefore C1 (""event5 eventually happens"") does not hold.
8. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", so C2 is True.

1. C1 requires a single state where both event9 and event3 are true (event9 AND event3).  
2. In this setting each state corresponds to a single event having happened, so two different events cannot be true simultaneously in the same state.  
3. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).  
4. C2 says C1 holds in the next state. If C1 is impossible, C2 is false in every state, including the next state.

1. C1 is ""Event8 always happens"" — i.e., at a state s, C1 holds iff in s and in every future state the event is event8.
2. Initially event8 holds, so check whether C1 already holds at the initial state.
3. From the context: ""After event8, either event2, event3, event5, event7, or event9 must happen."" In particular, event8 cannot follow event8 immediately (no self-loop to event8).
4. Therefore at the initial state (event8) the very next state is not event8, so C1 is false at the initial state.
5. Could C1 hold at some later state? For C1 to hold at some state s, every outgoing transition from s and from all reachable future states must yield event8 only. But no event's successor set is the singleton {event8}; every state either allows non-8 successors, or (for some events like event2, event7, event9) does not even allow event8 at all.
6. Hence there is no reachable state from which event8 is the only possible event forever after; C1 can never become true.
7. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.

2. C2 = (C1 OR event1). Since C1 is always false, C2 is equivalent to event1.

3. The initial state is ""event7 happened"" (event1 is false in the initial state). The hypothesis asks about C2 (no ""eventually"" is stated), so we evaluate it now: event1 is false now, so C2 is false now.

1. Initially event9 happened.
2. After event9, the next state must be one of: event2, event5, or event6.
3. C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is ""Event8 always happens"" (i.e., in that next state and all future states, event8 is true).
4. For C1 to hold in the next state, the immediate next state itself must have event8 true.
5. But the immediate next state after event9 can be event2, event5, or event6 — none of which is event8.
6. Therefore C1 is false in any possible next state, so C2 is false at the initial state.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event1. So the next state must be one of {event4, event5, event6, event7}.
- C1 (""Event6 always happens"") would require that the next state itself has event6 and that every future state also has event6.
- But there are allowed next states (e.g. event4, event5, event7) where event6 is not true at that state, so C1 does not hold in those next states.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed and is False."

- C1 = (event4 AND event2) — requires event4 and event2 simultaneously in one state.
- C2 = (event3 AND C1) — requires event3, event4, and event2 all true in the same state.

Step 2 — model constraint:
The context's ""After eventX, either ..."" clauses imply exactly one event holds per state (events are mutually exclusive within a state).

Step 3 — conclusion:
C1 demands two different events in one state, which is impossible; therefore C1 is always false, so C2 (which requires C1 and event3) is also false.

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — this must hold in the current state for C1 to be true there.  
2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" — means in every reachable state, the next event must be event2.  
3. Initially, event6 happened. The context specifies: after event6, either event2, event3, event4, event5, or event7 must happen.  
4. That means from the initial state the next event could be event3 (or 4,5,7) — not necessarily event2.  
5. Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the initial state, so C1 is not guaranteed everywhere.  
6. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate successor state is event3).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, the next state is event3).

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule for event2: after event2, either event1, event4, event5, or event9 must happen. Event3 is not among those successors.

Step 3 — conclude:
- At the initial state (event2), the next state cannot be event3, so C1 is false there.

Reasoning:
1. C1 says: if event1 happens, then event5 happens (in the same state).
2. Initially event8 happened. The context includes: after event8, either event1, event2, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen — so event1 can occur next.
3. When event1 occurs in a state, only one event holds in that state (events are mutually exclusive), so event5 does not hold simultaneously.
4. Therefore there is a reachable state where event1 holds but event5 does not, so C1 is false.
5. C2 states that C1 does not hold, so C2 is true."

Reasoning (concise):

2. From event7 the next state can be event4, event5, or event6.
3. Pick next = event6 (allowed). From event6 the subsequent states must be one of event2,3,4,5,8 — none forces event1.
4. Therefore, in that next state event1 is not guaranteed to hold always, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

1. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., Event1 holds in the initial state and in every future state).
2. The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in the initial state event2 is true and event1 is not true.
3. Therefore C1 is false (because Event1 does not hold in the initial state).
4. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (which would require C1 to be true in the initial state), but C1 is already false.
5. Hence C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 requires two things simultaneously in the same state: (a) event7 happens now, and (b) C1 holds, i.e. event8 happens in the next state.
2. Look at the transition rule after event7: after event7, either event1 or event5 must happen. Event8 is not an allowed successor of event7.
3. Therefore whenever event7 is true in a state, the next state cannot be event8, so C1 cannot hold in that state.
4. Hence there is no state where both event7 holds and event8 holds in the next state, so C2 is impossible.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

5. Neither event6 nor event9 is event7 or event8, so C1 is false in the next state.  
6. Therefore C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is False.

Reasoning:
1. C2 is (if C1 then event4), where C1 = ""event4 eventually happens"" (F event4).
2. Initially event9 holds. From event9 we can go to event2 (after event9 → event2). From event2 we can go to event4 (after event2 → event4). So there is a future state with event4 — C1 holds in the initial state.
3. Event4 does not hold in the initial state (initially event9).
4. Thus the implication (C1 → event4) has true antecedent and false consequent in the initial state, so C2 is False."

1. C2 asserts that C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") always holds (i.e., from every current state the next event is event4).  
2. Initially event6 happened.  
3. The rules for event6 say the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5, event7, event8, event9} — event4 is not among them.  
4. Therefore at the initial state C1 is false (the next state cannot be event4).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the proposition ""event4 AND event1"" — it requires event4 and event1 to be true in the same state.
2. The scenario describes a single event happening at each state (states record which event just happened). After any event the next state is one chosen from the listed single-event options.
3. Therefore no state can make two different events true simultaneously.
4. Hence C1 is never true in any state.
5. C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 never holds, C2 is false."

2. C1 is ""event5 and event1"" — that requires both event5 and event1 to be true in the same state.
3. Only one event can be true in any single state, so C1 is false in the initial state (and in any single state).

1. C1: ""Event7 happens in the next state.""  
   C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future state there is a transition whose target is event7 (equivalently: event7 occurs at some future time).

2. From the context, the relevant transitions (condensed) are:
   - 9 -> {1,2,4,5,7,8}
   - 1 -> {8,9}
   - 8 -> {2,4,6,9}
   - (other events also have transitions, some including 7, some not)

3. Starting at the initial state event9, we can choose the following transitions:
   - 9 -> 1 (allowed)
   - 1 -> 8 (allowed)
   - 8 -> 9 (allowed)

   This gives the cycle 9 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> ... that repeats indefinitely.

4. This infinite trace never visits event7, so there exists a valid execution of the system in which C1 never holds (no state has its next state = event7). Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed by the context.

1. C1 is the proposition ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"", i.e. (event2 -> event2).
2. For any state that statement is always true (an implication p -> p is a tautology).
3. Therefore C1 holds (true) in the model (indeed in every state, including the initial state).
4. C2 states ""C1 does not hold"", which contradicts (3).

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — understand C2: it asserts ""Event8 happens AND C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., event9 is true in every state).

Step 2 — check the initial state: the context says ""Initially, event8 happened"", so Event8 does happen (initially true).

Step 3 — check C1: for ""Event9 always happens"" to be true, the initial state would have to be event9 (and every subsequent state would also have to be event9). But the initial state is event8, not event9, so C1 is already false.

Step 4 — since C2 requires C1 to hold and C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event8 is true).

Therefore the hypothesis C2 is False.

1. C1 is ""Event7 happens and Event6 happens"" — that requires both Event7 and Event6 to be true in the same state.  
2. As in the examples, only one event can hold in any single state, so no state can have both Event7 and Event6 simultaneously. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).

1. C1 says ""Event5 happens and Event8 happens"" — this requires both event5 and event8 to be true in the same state.  
2. In this event system, states are labeled by which single event happened; transitions specify the next single event. There is no rule allowing two different events to hold simultaneously. (This follows the same interpretation used in the examples.)  
3. Therefore it is impossible for event5 and event8 to be true at the same time in any state, so C1 can never hold.  
4. If C1 never holds, then C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""event5 eventually happens"" (i.e., F event5). C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, event5 is guaranteed to occur in the future).
2. Start state: event9. From event9 allowed next events include event3 (9 -> 3).
3. From event3 allowed next events include event1 (3 -> 1).
4. From event1 allowed next events include event3 (1 -> 3).
5. Thus there is a reachable cycle 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... that never visits event5.
6. Because there exists a (infinite) execution from the initial state that avoids event5 forever, event5 is not guaranteed to eventually happen from every reachable state.
7. Therefore C2 (""event5 eventually happens"" always) is false."

1. C1 is the state formula ""if event5 happens then event2 happens"" (event5 ⇒ event2).
2. C2 says C1 holds in the next state (so from the initial state, every immediate successor state must satisfy event5 ⇒ event2).
3. Initially event9 happened. The context gives: after event9, either event2, event4, event5, event7, or event8 must happen — so an immediate successor state can be event5.
4. In a state where event5 happens, event2 is not true (only one event holds per state), so event5 ⇒ event2 is false in that successor.
5. Therefore C1 does not hold in that next state, so C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1). C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (G F event1): from every reachable state, event1 must occur later on every possible continuation.
2. From the initial state event7, one possible next event is event2 (7 -> 2).
3. From event2 you can choose event5 (2 -> 5). From event5 choose event4 (5 -> 4). From event4 choose event2 (4 -> 2).
4. This gives a reachable cycle 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 that can be repeated indefinitely and never visits event1.
5. Therefore there exists an infinite run starting at the initial state in which event1 never occurs, so C1 does not hold on all continuations from every state.
6. Hence C2 (that C1 always holds) is False."

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 requires that from some state onward, every state has event9.
- But the transitions after event9 go to {event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, event8} — event9 is not an option.
- Thus you can never have event9 hold in two consecutive states, so it's impossible for event9 to hold in all future states from any point.
- Therefore C1 can never become true, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event7 happens (state s0).
2. From event7 the next state s1 can be any of: event3, event4, event5, event6, or event9.
3. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state s1. C1 says ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in s2).
   So C2 requires that from s1 the following state s2 is event2.
4. Consider the possible s1 = event3 (this is allowed from event7).
5. From event3 the allowed next states are event1, event5, event7, or event9 — event2 is not allowed.
6. Thus if s1 = event3, C1 is false in s1 (there is no next-state event2), so C2 is not guaranteed.
7. Because there is an allowed run where C2 fails, C2 is not true in general.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens; after event1, event8 must happen. So the sequence begins 1 → 8.
- From event8 we can choose event2 (8 → 2). From event2 we can choose event5 (2 → 5). Thus event5 eventually happens, so C1 holds on this path.
- From event5 one allowed successor is event6 (5 → 6), and from event6 one allowed successor is event5 (6 → 5). So we can loop 5 ↔ 6 forever.
- None of the transitions used in the path 1 → 8 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 5 → ... require event3, and the 5–6 cycle never produces event3.
- Therefore there is a valid execution where event5 eventually happens but event3 never happens. That makes the implication ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" false."

1. C1 is a state formula: (event8 → event5). For C1 to hold in a state where event8 is true, event5 must also be true in that same state. (As in the examples, exactly one event holds per state, so event8 and event5 cannot both be true simultaneously in one state.)

2. Initially event4 happens. After event4, one possible next event is event8 (the context explicitly lists event8 among the choices after event4).

3. Thus there is a reachable state where event8 holds. In that state event5 does not hold (only one event holds), so C1 is false in that state.

4. Since C1 is false in a reachable state, C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

1. C1 is ""Event7 happens and event3 happens"" — this requires event7 and event3 to be true in the same single state.  
2. In this model each state is labeled by exactly one event (after any event, one of the listed next events must happen), so two different events cannot be true simultaneously in one state.  
3. Therefore C1 can never be true in any state.  
4. If C1 is never true, then C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

1. C1 is ""Event7 happens in the next state.""

3. From the context: After event7, either event5 or event8 must happen. There is no rule allowing event7 to follow event7.

1. Initial state: event7 happened.  
2. C1 = (event6 or event2).  
3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after event7, event2 or event6 must be true.  
4. From the context: after event7, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event6, event8, event9}.  
5. Some allowed next events (event3, event4, event8, event9) are not in C1. For example, the next state could be event3, in which case C1 is false.  
6. Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state; C2 is not guaranteed.

1. Initial state: event8 is true; event1, event4, event5 are false in the initial state.
2. C1 is the proposition (event5 → event4). Because event5 is false in the initial state, the implication event5 → event4 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true). So C1 holds in the initial state.
3. C2 is the proposition (C1 → event1). In the initial state C1 is true (from step 2) but event1 is false, so the implication C1 → event1 is false.

2. From the context: after event2, one of {event1, event3, event4, event6, event7, event8} must happen.  
3. In particular, event6 is one of the allowed successors of event2, so there is a (next) state where event6 happens.  
4. C1 is ""event6 or event9"". That next state (event6) satisfies C1.  
5. Therefore there exists a future state in which C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

Reasoning:
1. Initially event5 holds (so event6 does not hold in the initial state).
2. C2 = (Event1 holds in the next state) OR (event6 holds now).
3. The second disjunct is false in the initial state (event6 is not true).
4. After event5 the next state must be one of {event1, event4, event7, event9} — event1 is possible but not guaranteed.
5. Therefore ""Event1 happens in the next state"" is not entailed by the context (it may or may not occur).
6. Since neither disjunct is guaranteed, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Thus C2 is False."

3. C1 is ""Event9 does not happen."" C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state event9 does not happen.

1. C1 is ""Event8 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the current state's next event is event8). C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists a state whose next event is event8).

2. Which events allow event8 as a successor? From the context, only ""After event3, either event1, event2, event5, event8, or event9 must happen."" No other ""after"" clause lists event8. So only a state with event3 can have its next state be event8.

3. Can we reach event3 from the initial state? Initially event1 happened, and ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, or event7 must happen."" So from event1 we can choose event3 as the next state.

4. If we take the choices: event1 -> event3 -> event8, then at the event3 state the next event is event8, so C1 holds in that state. Therefore C1 holds at some point, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

Reasoning:
1. Only one event can hold in any single state, so C1 (event2 AND event1 in the same state) is impossible and thus always false.
2. Therefore C2 (C1 OR event9) is equivalent to just event9.
3. Initially event4 holds, so event9 does not hold in the initial state.
4. Hence C2 is false (at the initial state)."

1. C2 asserts that in the next state C1 holds. C1 is (event2 AND event1) — both event2 and event1 must be true simultaneously in that next state.  
2. The model's transitions describe a single event happening at each state (as in the examples): from the initial event9 the next state must be either event3 or event4 (the context repeatedly states ""after event9, either event3 or event4 must happen"").  
3. Therefore the immediate next state is either event3 or event4, neither of which can make both event1 and event2 true simultaneously. No rule allows a single state where event1 and event2 are both true.  
4. Hence C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false.

2. C2 is ""Event6 and C1"", so C2 simplifies to (Event6 and Event8) — both must hold in the same state.  
3. In this event model a single state/event occurs at a time (events do not co-occur in the same state). Even though the transition rules allow event6 in some next states and event8 in others (e.g. after event9), they never make event6 and event8 true simultaneously.  
4. Therefore C2 (Event6 and Event8 in the same state) cannot be satisfied.

1. C1 is ""event4 and event2"" — since exactly one event holds in any state, C1 can never be true in a single state (two events cannot hold simultaneously). So C1 is impossible.

2. C2 is ""C1 holds or event3 happens"". With C1 impossible, C2 reduces to ""event3 happens"" (i.e., some state where event3 is true).

3. From the context: Initially event5. After event5, event9 must happen. From event9 we can choose event4 (event9 allows event1, event4, event5, or event6). From event4 we can choose event3 (event4 allows event3, event5, or event6). Thus there is a reachable state where event3 holds.

4. Therefore C2 can be satisfied (there exists a reachable state with event3), so C2 is True.

1. C1 is ""event5 or event1 holds"" (i.e., the current state is 5 or 1).  
2. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state along every trace, the event is 5 or 1).  
3. The context says ""Initially, event5 happened."" So C1 is true initially.  
4. But the context also contains the rule ""After event5, either event3, or event4 must happen."" (This rule appears repeatedly but consistently gives only 3 or 4 after 5.)  
5. Therefore the next state after the initial state must be event3 or event4. In those states neither event5 nor event1 holds, so C1 is false in that next state.  
6. Because there is a reachable state where C1 is false, C1 does not hold at all times; hence C2 is false.

1. C1 is the state formula ""If event5 happens, then event8 happens"" — i.e. in any single state, event5 ⇒ event8.
2. As in the examples, states are labeled by a single event, so two different events cannot both be true in the same state. Thus C1 can only hold either vacuously (if event5 never occurs) or be false in any state where event5 occurs (because event8 would not hold in that state).
3. The initial state is event8.
4. The context explicitly allows: ""After event8, either event2, event3, event5, event6, or event7 must happen."" So from the initial state we can transition to a state where event5 happens.
5. In that reachable state event5 is true and event8 is false, so the implication event5 ⇒ event8 (C1) is false there.
6. Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The system has exactly one event true in the initial state; the Context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So the initial state is event2 (not event5 and not event8).
2. C1 is ""Event5 always happens"" — this requires event5 to be true in every state (including the initial state). The initial state is event2, so C1 is false.
3. C2 is ""Event8 happens or C1 holds."" At the initial state, event8 does not hold and C1 is false, so the disjunction is false at the initial state.
4. Therefore C2 is False."

1. C2 = Event1 AND C1, and C1 = (Event6 OR Event8). So C2 requires Event1 and (Event6 or Event8) to hold simultaneously in the same state.
2. The model uses states where exactly one event happens at a time (as in the examples). The initial state is event7.
3. In the initial state event1, event6, and event8 are all false, so C2 is false at the initial state.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event7 eventually happens."" That is true in the initial state because initially event7 happened.
- To show C2 (""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"") is false it suffices to give a permitted trace where C1 is true but event4 never occurs.
- From event7 the system must go to event9, and from event9 one allowed choice is event7. So the trace 7 → 9 → 7 → 9 → ... is allowed.
- In that trace event7 does occur (C1 holds) but event4 never happens.

1. C1 is ""Event7 happens and event2 happens"" — that requires both event7 and event2 to be true in the same state.  
2. In this model only one event occurs per state (transitions specify a single next event), so two different events cannot hold simultaneously in one state.  
3. The initial state has event1, so C1 is already false at the initial state.  
4. Since C1 does not hold in all states (it fails immediately), C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

3. C2 is ""if C1 holds, then event4 happens"" (C1 -> event4). Since C1 is true at the initial state, C2 requires event4 to be true at that state.

- C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — this is just Event3 happens.
- C2: C1 eventually holds — i.e., Event3 happens at some (current or future) state.

Now check reachability from the initial state:

- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, one possible next event is event5 (allowed: 1,5,6,7,9).
- After event5, event3 is allowed (allowed: 1,2,3,6,7,8,9).

So there is a path: event4 -> event5 -> event3. Therefore Event3 does occur eventually.

1. Interpret C1 as a same-state implication: ""If event8 happens, then event9 happens"" means in any given state, event8 → event9. (As in the examples, events are properties of the same state.)

2. In this model states are mutually exclusive single events (only one event holds in a state). So for C1 to hold in a state where event8 is true, event9 would also have to be true in that same state — impossible unless event8 never occurs at all.

3. Check reachability of event8 from the initial state. Initially event5 holds. From the context:
   - After event5, event3 can happen.
   - After event3, event4 can happen.
   - After event4, event8 can happen.
   Thus there is a path 5 → 3 → 4 → 8, so event8 is reachable.

4. At the reachable state where event8 holds, event9 does not hold (only one event holds per state), so C1 is violated.

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

1. C1 is the statement: ""If event8 happens, then event6 happens."" Interpreted here as in the same state: event8 -> event6.
2. For that implication to hold in this model, no reachable state may have event8 true without event6 also true. But only one event can hold in a state, so the implication can only hold if event8 never occurs.
3. Initially event3 holds.
4. The context says: after event3, either event1, event4, event6, event7, or event8 must happen. So from the initial state a next state with event8 is allowed.

1. C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens."" From the initial event3, one allowed next event is event8, and after event8 one allowed next event is event1. So there is a reachable future state with event1 — C1 is True.

2. C2 is ""Event8 happens and C1 holds."" Plain ""Event8 happens"" (without ""eventually"") means event8 is the current event. Initially event3 is true, so event8 is not true in the initial state.

3. Therefore the conjunction (Event8 now) AND (C1) is false at the initial state (false ∧ true = false).

1. C1 is ""event2 and event6 happen"" — it requires both event2 and event6 to be true in the same state.
2. From the context-style of these problems, each state is a single event occurrence (the ""after eventX, either ... must happen"" structure implies exactly one event holds per state).
3. Therefore C1 cannot be true in any single state (two different events cannot both hold simultaneously).
4. C2 requires C1 to hold in the immediate next state after the initial state.
5. Initially event1 happened; after event1 the next state is either event7 or event8, so the next state is definitely not a state where event2 and event6 both hold.
6. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event6 happened. So in the initial state event6 is true and every other event (including event4 and event7) is false in that state.
2. C1 is ""Event7 does not happen."" Interpreted at the initial state, that is true (event7 is not the initial event).
3. C2 is ""C1 holds and event4 happens"" — i.e. both (event7 does not happen) and (event4 is true) in the same state.
4. In the initial state C1 is true but event4 is false.
5. Therefore C2 is false (the conjunction is not satisfied)."

1. C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., in every state from a given point onward, event2 is true.
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — so starting from the initial state (which is event9), C2 requires that in the immediate next state C1 is true (i.e., that event2 holds in every state from that next state onward).
3. From the context: after event9, the next event must be one of event3, event4, or event7.
4. The next state therefore has event3 or event4 or event7 — not event2 — so event2 is false in that next state.

1. C2 means: in the next state, C1 holds.  
2. C1 is the conjunction (event7 AND event1) — both events must be true simultaneously in the same state.  
3. In this model each state corresponds to a single event (only one event can be true at a time). So two different events cannot be true together in any state.  
4. Therefore C1 is impossible in any state, so it cannot hold in the next state.  
5. Hence C2 is False.

2. In this model each state is a single event occurrence (one event holds at a time), so two different events cannot be true simultaneously in a single state.

Reasoning (brief):
- C2 requires a single state where event9 is true AND (event8 OR event3) is true simultaneously.
- In this model each state is labeled by exactly one event (the context transitions show which single next event happens).
- Thus no state can have event9 and event8 (or event3) true at the same time.
- Although event9 is reachable (e.g. initial event8 -> next event9), in that state only event9 holds, so C1 (event8 or event3) is false there.
- Therefore C2 cannot be satisfied."

1. C1 is the statement (event4 -> event9), i.e. whenever event4 occurs in a state, event9 also occurs in that same state. With one event per state, that means C1 is false if any reachable state has event4.

2. From the context: Initially event5. From event5 we can go to event2 (allowed: 2,7,9).

3. From event2 we can go to event4 (allowed: 1,3,4,5,6,8). So there is a reachable state where event4 occurs.

4. In that state event9 is not true (only one event per state), so C1 is false.

5. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning:
1. Initially event6 is true, so event3 is false now. Thus the left disjunct of C2 (""Event3 happens"") is false.
2. C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From event6 the rules say the next state must be either event1 or event7. Because event7 is a possible next state, Event1 is not guaranteed in the next state, so C1 does not hold now.
3. Since neither disjunct holds, C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is false."

Reasoning:
1. Initially event8 happened.
2. The rules say: after event8, either event2, event5, event7, or event9 must happen.
3. Therefore event2 can happen in the next state — C1 is possible.
4. C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 does not happen next). That is not guaranteed by the context.
5. Because event2 is allowed next, C2 is not entailed and so is False."

1. C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens."" The initial state is event2, so C1 is true immediately.
2. C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event9 happens."" Since C1 is true in the initial state, C2 would require that event9 must occur on every possible future from the initial state.
3. From event2 we can choose the transition to event1 (allowed). From event1 we can choose event8. From event8 we can choose event2. That yields an infinite loop 2 → 1 → 8 → 2 → ... that never visits event9.
4. Because there exists a valid run starting from the initial state in which event9 never happens, the implication (C1 ⇒ event9) is not guaranteed.

1. C1 is ""Event5 always happens"" — i.e., in the current state (and every state) event5 is true.
2. The initial state is given as event6 (event6 happened initially).
3. In that initial state event5 is not true (event6 is true instead).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1: ""Event7 happens or event7 happens"" simplifies to just ""Event7 happens.""
2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" therefore means ""Event7 happens in the immediate next state.""
3. Initially event1 happened. After event1, the next state must be one of: event4, event6, or event7.
4. Although event7 is a possible next state, it is not the only possible one (the next state could be event4 or event6).
5. Therefore, C2 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state — it is not necessarily true from the initial state.

1. Initially event4 is true (only event4 holds in the initial state).  
2. C1 = (event9 AND event4). That requires event9 and event4 to be true in the same state. Only one event holds in a state, so C1 is impossible (false) in the initial state — and in fact cannot hold in any single state.  
3. C2 = (event8 OR C1). Since C1 is false, C2 reduces to event8.  
4. In the initial state event8 is not true (only event4 is). Although event8 is a possible next event after event4, the hypothesis as stated has no temporal operator (""event8 happens"" here is interpreted as holding in the current state). Therefore C2 is false in the initial state.

Reasoning:
1. C2 says C1 always holds. C1 is the state implication ""if event7 happens, then event4 happens"" (i.e., whenever a state has event7 true it also has event4 true).
2. Initially event2 happens. After event2, one possible next event is event7 (the context allows event3, event5, event7, or event8).
3. Therefore a state with event7 is reachable. In that state event4 is not true (only one event holds in a state), so C1 is violated there.

Reasoning (concise):
1. Initially event5 holds. From the context, the immediate successor (next state) must be one of: event2, event3, event4, or event8.
2. C2 requires that in that next state C1 holds, where C1 is ""event9 AND event3"" (both simultaneously).
3. In this model a state is a single event (only one event can hold in a given state), so no state can have both event9 and event3 true at the same time.
4. Therefore the next state cannot satisfy C1, so C2 is False."

1. Initially, event2 happened.  
2. After event2, one possible next event is event7 (the context explicitly lists ""After event2, either event3, event4, or event7 must happen"").  
3. Therefore event7 can occur in the future from the initial state, so C1 (""Event7 eventually happens"") is true.

1. Initially event4 happened.
2. The context includes the rule: ""After event4, either event1, event2, event5, event7, or event9 must happen.""
3. That rule allows event9 to occur immediately after the initial event4 (nondeterministically).
4. Therefore there is a possible state where event9 happens, so ""Event9 does not happen"" is not true in all states.
5. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

1. C1 = (event5 AND event3). This requires event5 and event3 to be true in the same state.
2. In these problems a state records a single event having happened (only one event is true at a time), so no state can have both event3 and event5 true simultaneously. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).
3. C2 = (if event3 happens, then C1 holds). Evaluate at the initial state: event3 happens initially, but C1 is false there (and everywhere).
4. An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false. So C2 is false.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event4 occurred. From event4 the next state must be either event7 or event8.
- If we choose the branch event4 -> event8 (allowed), then from event8 the next state must be either event6 or event9.
- Taking event8 -> event6 (allowed) yields a two-step sequence 4 -> 8 -> 6 in which event1 does not occur at the second step.
- C2 asserts that ""event1 happens two steps from the initial state"" in every possible continuation; the example above is a valid continuation where event1 does not happen at that time.
Therefore C2 is False."

1. C1 is ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., event9 holds in the initial state and at every future state).
2. The context states: ""Initially, event5 happened."" So in the initial state event5 is true and event9 is not true.
3. Therefore C1 is false already in the initial state (event9 does not hold there).
4. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — this asserts that C1 is true at all states. Since C1 is already false in the initial state, C2 cannot hold.

1. C2 is ""Event9 happens or C1 holds"" where C1 = ""Event1 and Event7 happen"" (simultaneously).
2. In these models only one event is true per state, so C1 (both Event1 and Event7 in the same state) is impossible.
3. We only need Event9 to occur at some point to make C2 true.
4. Initially Event3 holds. After Event3, Event1 is one allowed next event.
5. After Event1, Event9 is one allowed next event.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event8 occurs. From event8 we can go to event6 (8 -> 6).
2. From event6 we can go to event3 (6 -> 3). So C1 (event3 eventually happens) can hold.
3. After event3, the system can follow the cycle 3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 3:
   - 3 -> 2 (allowed),
   - 2 -> 8 (allowed),
   - 8 -> 6 (allowed),
   - 6 -> 3 (allowed).
4. This cycle visits no event4 state, so once event3 has occurred the run can continue forever without ever reaching event4.
5. Therefore it is not guaranteed that ""if event3 eventually happens then event4 happens."" C2 is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. In this formalism each state corresponds to exactly one event happening — two different events cannot be true in the same state simultaneously.
2. C1 is ""Event4 or Event6"" — meaning the current state is either event4 or event6.
3. C2 is ""C1 holds and event7 happens"" — i.e. the current state must be event7 and at the same time be event4 or event6.
4. That requires two different events to hold in a single state (event7 and event4 or event6), which is impossible.
5. Therefore C2 cannot be true in any state; C2 is False."

1. C1 is the state formula ""If event6 happens, then event8 happens"" — given the domain, only one event can be true in any state, so C1 would require that no state has event6 true (because event8 cannot be true simultaneously with event6).

2. The context says: initially event4 happened, and after event4 either event2, event3, event6, event7, or event9 must happen. Thus there is a reachable state where event6 happens (immediately after the initial event4).

3. In that reachable state event6 is true and event8 is false (since exactly one event holds), so the implication ""event6 -> event8"" (C1) is false.

4. Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initial state: event5 holds.
2. From event5 the allowed next events (time1) include event1 (among others).
3. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state."" So from the initial state, C2 requires that at time1, C1 is true.
4. C1 is ""event9 happens in the next state."" So C1 being true at time1 requires event9 to occur at time2.
5. Exhibit a valid trace that falsifies this: choose time1 = event1 (allowed from event5). From event1, the allowed next events (time2) include event2 (not only event9).
6. If at time2 we choose event2, then event9 does not occur at time2, so C1 is false at time1. Therefore C2 is false at the initial state.
7. Because there is an allowed behavior where C2 does not hold, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the conjunction: ""Event7 happens"" AND ""Event5 eventually happens"" (C1).
2. In these problems plain ""EventX happens"" refers to the current (initial) state unless an explicit temporal operator is present.
3. The context states ""Initially, event8 happened."" So at the initial state event7 is false (event8 is true instead).
4. Therefore the first conjunct ""Event7 happens"" is false at the initial state.
5. A conjunction is false if any conjunct is false, so C2 is false regardless of whether C1 holds.
6. Hence C2 is False."
