Reasoning:
- From the rules, after event7 (the initial event) event4 is possible (7 -> 4), so the antecedent ""event4 happens"" can occur.
- From event4 the allowed next events include event1 (4 -> 1). From event1 you can pick event2 (1 -> 2). From event2 you can pick event4 again (2 -> 4). This gives a cycle 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 that can repeat forever.
- That cycle never includes event8, so it is possible for event4 to occur and yet for event8 to never happen. Therefore ""if event4 happens then event8 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed.

Reasoning (concise):
- Start from the given initial event 9. After 9 we may choose event 7 (allowed: 1,4,5,7).
- From 7 we may choose event 8 (allowed: 3,8,9). From 8 we may choose event 7 (allowed: 4,5,6,7).
- This yields the infinite run 9, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, ... in which event8 occurs repeatedly (so a natural reading of ""Event8 always happens"" — i.e. 8 occurs indefinitely/often — is satisfied) but event5 never occurs.
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"" is not valid; C2 is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts that event2 happens (it repeats the same claim twice).
- The initial event is event9.
- From event9, the rules allow either event2, event3, event4, or event6 to happen next. So event2 is a permitted continuation from the initial state.
- Because there exists at least one allowed sequence in which event2 does occur, C1 can be true in some allowed execution.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., that event2 does not happen). The context does not entail that event2 cannot happen — in fact it may happen — so we cannot conclude C1 is false.
Therefore C2 is False."

This infinite cycle includes event7 but never includes event9 or event6 (we explicitly avoid choosing any transition to 9 or 8->6). Therefore event7 can occur without event9 and event6 ever happening. So ""if 7 happens then (9 and 6 happen)"" is not guaranteed.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/event).
- C2 is the negation: ""Event4 does not always happen.""
- From the context, after the initial event4 the rules allow the next event to be either event6 or event7. So we can choose event6 next (which is permitted).
- After event6, one allowed next event is event1. So we can have the sequence: event4 (initial) → event6 → event1.
- At the second step the event is 6 (not 4), so event4 does not occur at every step. This is a concrete allowed sequence that violates ""event4 always happens.""
- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning summary:
- C1 states: whenever event2 happens, event5 must happen. The rules show that after event2 one possible next event is event1 (not necessarily event5), so C1 is not guaranteed.
- Specifically, starting from the initial event9 we can follow 9 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... indefinitely. This path contains event2 but never contains event5, so C1 is false on that path and event5 does not happen.
- Therefore the disjunction C2 (""event5 happens or C1 holds"") is false (both disjuncts can be false)."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4 either event1 or event7 must happen. Choose event7.
- After event7 either event4, event5, event6, or event9 must happen. Choose event4.
- Repeat: after event4 choose event7 again, and so on. This produces a valid sequence 4 → 7 → 4 → 7 → ... where event7 occurs but event1 never occurs.
- That sequence makes C1 (""event7 does not happen"") false and event1 does not happen, so C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context, after event9 one possible next event is event6; after event6 one possible next event is event4; after event4 possible next events are only 6,7,8,9 (not event1). So the sequence 9 → 6 → 4 occurs and 4 is not followed by 1 there. Therefore C1 (""If event4 happens, then event1 happens"") is false (counterexample: 4 followed by 6).

- C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" To refute C2 it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence where C1 is false and event2 never occurs. From 9 you can go to 6, then 4, then back to 6, then 4, etc., looping 6 ↔ 4 forever. This sequence is allowed by the rules, contains event4 (so C1 is false), and never contains event2. Hence the disjunction C2 is false in that model.

Thus C2 is not guaranteed; answer: False."

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — What the hypothesis says
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: Event5 happens or C1 holds (i.e., Event5 ∨ (not Event3)).

We must decide whether C2 is true given the event rules and the initial event.

Step 2 — Examine the rules and reachable events
- Initial event: event4 occurs.
- From event4 the next event must be one of {2,5,7,8,9}.
- From those events the allowed follow-ups are:
  - After 2 → {1,6}
  - After 1 → {2,5,7,8}
  - After 6 → {2,7,8,9}
  - After 7 → {2,4,6}
  - After 5 → {2,4,7,8,9}
  - After 8 → {5,9}
  - After 9 → {4}
- After 3 → 4 is listed, but no rule allows any event to be followed by event3 (i.e., no transition leads to event3).

Step 3 — Can event3 ever occur?
- Because the only allowed next events are those given by the rules and none of those rules produce event3, there is no way to reach event3 starting from the initial event4. Therefore event3 does not happen. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2
- C2 is the disjunction “event5 happens or C1 holds.” We already established C1 holds (event3 does not happen). A disjunction with a true disjunct is true regardless of whether event5 happens.

- C2 says: If C1 (event9 always happens), then event5 happens.
- The context explicitly says ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 already occurs (at least once) in every execution described by the context.
- Therefore, in every scenario where C1 holds, event5 still happens (because it already happened initially).
- So the implication ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens"" is true."

</graphml>",0.0,"We must decide whether ""If C1 holds (Event6 always happens) then event7 happens"" is true.

1) Restate: C1 says event6 is inevitable (we can ensure event6 occurs). C2 claims that inevitability of event6 forces event7 to occur.

2) Use the rules (condensed):
- initially: event3
- after 3 → {4,5,6,7}
- after 6 → {2,4,5}
- after 2 → {6,9}
(plus other rules that include 7 as an option from some states, but not forced)

3) Construct a valid sequence that satisfies C1 but avoids event7:
- From initial 3 choose 6: 3 → 6.
- From 6 choose 2: 6 → 2.
- From 2 choose 6: 2 → 6.
Repeat 6 → 2 → 6 → 2 → ... indefinitely.

This infinite trace is allowed by the rules, contains event6 repeatedly (so C1 is satisfied), and never contains event7.

4) Conclusion: C1 does not imply event7 must happen (there exists a rule-consistent execution where 6 always occurs and 7 never occurs). Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False"

We can refute this by giving a valid run (starting from the given initial event8) in which event5 occurs but event6 never occurs.

Valid transitions (from the context) include:
- 8 -> {3,4,5,6,9}
- 5 -> {1,2,3,6,7}
- 1 -> {2,4,6,7,9}
- 2 -> {3,4,6,7}

8 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> ... 

Every step above is allowed by the rules, and none of the chosen successors is event6. This produces an infinite run in which event5 occurs but event6 never occurs. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

</graphml>",1.0,"We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 asserts that both event4 and event9 happen.

From the rules we can choose different allowed next events; the rules do not force a single unique sequence, so to refute that C1 necessarily holds it suffices to give a valid sequence starting from event7 in which either event4 or event9 never occurs.

Counterexample sequence:
- Start: event7.
- From 7 choose event2 (allowed).
- From 2 choose event5 (allowed).
- From 5 choose event1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose event5 (allowed).
Now we can loop 5 -> 1 -> 5 indefinitely. This valid path never produces event4 or event9.

- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event6 happens or C1 holds"" i.e. (Event6) OR (Event3 does not happen).

C2 is false exactly when Event6 does not happen AND Event3 does happen. So to refute C2 it suffices to exhibit a valid event sequence where 3 occurs and 6 never occurs.

Step 2 — use the rules to build such a sequence
- Initially event7 happens.
- From 7 → 9 (forced).
- From 9 we can choose 4.
- From 4 → 2 (allowed).
- From 2 → 3 (allowed). So event3 occurs.
- From 3 → 9 (allowed).
- From 9 → 7 (allowed).
- Then 7 → 9, and we can loop 7↔9 forever, never choosing 6.

This sequence is consistent with all given rules, contains event3, and never contains event6.

Step 2 — facts from the context:
- The context begins with ""Initially, event7 happened."" That means event7 has occurred (at the start), so event7 does eventually happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- Since event7 happened initially, C1 is true.

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence:
- Start: event4 (given).
- From event4 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event4 (allowed).
- Repeat: 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → … indefinitely.

In this run event2 does occur, and we can always choose the 4→2→4 loop so that event8 never occurs.

- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., whenever event4 occurs, the next state must be event5.

Step 2 — Examine the rules
- The rules include: ""After event4, either event1, event2, event3, event5, event6, or event7 must happen.""
  (This appears more than once but is the same set of possible successors.)

Step 3 — Reasoning
- From event4, event5 is one possible next event but not the only one; event1, event2, event3, event6, or event7 could happen instead.
- Therefore event5 is not guaranteed after event4, so C1 does not necessarily hold whenever event4 happens.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says ""event2 happens in the next state."" C2 asserts that if that is true then event8 happens.
2. From the rules: after event2, the possible successors are {event3, event4, event6, event7, event8}. Event8 is only one possible successor, not the only one.
3. In particular, after event2 you can have event3, and after event3 event2 must happen — so you can cycle 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 ... without ever reaching event8.
4. That gives a valid counterexample where C1 holds (event2 occurs) but event8 does not happen. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event7 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., ""if event1 happens then event7 does not happen"").

Step 2 — examine the context
- The context explicitly says ""Initially, event7 happened."" So event7 does happen. Therefore C1 is false (event7 does happen).

Step 3 — can event1 happen?
- From event7 we can have event3 next (""After event7, either event3 or event8 must happen"").
- From event3 we can have event1 next (""After event3, either event1, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen"").
- So a valid sequence is: event7 → event3 → event1. That sequence is consistent with the rules.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- In the sequence above event1 happens while event7 has already happened, so C1 (event7 does not happen) is false when event1 happens. Thus the implication ""if event1 happens then C1 holds"" is false (there exists a counterexample).

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 we may choose event5 (rule: after event6 one of {1,2,3,4,5} must happen).
- After event5 we can choose event2 (rule: after event5 one of {1,2,3,8,9}).
- After event2 we can choose event7 (rule: after event2 one of {1,3,5,6,7}).
- After event7 we can choose event5 (rule: after event7 one of {1,3,5,6,8,9}).

This gives the cycle 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 5, which can repeat forever. Thus there exists a run in which event5 occurs infinitely often, so it is not guaranteed that ""event5 does not happen"" will eventually hold. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the given rules, the transition graph is:
  - 2 -> 1
  - 1 -> {4,6,8,9}
  - 4 -> {3,6}
  - 3 -> {1,4,5,9}
  - 6 -> {2,5,9}
  - 5 -> {1,3,6,8,9}
  - 8 -> {1,2,3,5}
  - 9 -> {2,3,4}
  - 7 -> {1,2,3,5,6}
- The process starts at event2. There is no rule that produces event7 as a successor of any event reachable from the start (no incoming edge to 7), so event7 can never occur in any valid sequence.
- Therefore C1 (event3 and event7 both happen) is impossible. An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true, so ""if C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is True."

</graphml>",1.0,"We ask whether ""C1 does not hold"" is true. C1 says ""Event4 happens or event4 happens"" — i.e. C1 simply asserts that event4 occurs. So C2 asserts that event4 does not occur.

From the context: initial event8 happens, and after event8 the possible next events are {2,3,5}. We can choose transitions to avoid event4 forever. For example:

- Start at 8 (given).
- From 8 choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2 choose 6 (allowed; 2 → {4,6,7}).
- From 6 choose 1 (allowed; 6 → {1,2,3,5,7,8}).
- From 1 choose 8 (allowed; 1 → {2,3,5,6,8}).

This gives a cycle 8 → 2 → 6 → 1 → 8 that never visits event4. Since there exists a valid sequence starting from the initial event8 that avoids event4, event4 is not guaranteed to happen. Therefore C1 is not entailed, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at the given initial event7.
- From event7 you can go to event8 (allowed: 3, 5, or 8).
- From event8 you can go to event2 (allowed: 2, 3, 5, 7, or 9).
- From event2 you can go to event6 (allowed: 3, 6, 7, or 8).
  Thus we can reach event6: 7 → 8 → 2 → 6.
- After event6, event1 is only one possible next event (6 allows 1,2,3,4,5,7,8). It is not forced.
- From 6 we can choose 2, and then loop 2 ↔ 3 indefinitely (2 allows 3,6,7,8; 3 allows 2,4,8). This yields an infinite run that never includes event1.
- Therefore there exists a run where event6 happens but event1 never happens, so ""If event6 happens, then event1 always happens"" is false.

- 9 -> 2 (after 9, 2 is allowed; so this occurrence of 9 is not followed by 1, making C1 false).
- 2 -> 3 (2 allows 3).
- 3 -> 4 (3 allows 4).
- 4 -> 8 (4 allows 8).
- 8 -> 9 (8 allows 9).

Now we have a cycle 9 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 9 that never requires event6; at every step we chose an allowed successor that is not 6. This trace contains an occurrence of 9 not followed by 1 (so C1 is false) and avoids event6 entirely. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3, the allowed next events are {event2, event5, event6, event8}.
- To show ""event6 always happens"" is false, it suffices to find a valid sequence that never includes event6.
- Pick event5 after event3 (allowed). From event5, allowed next events are {event1, event3, event4}.
- Pick event3 after event5. Now we are back at event3 and can repeat the same choices indefinitely (event3 → event5 → event3 → ...).
- This infinite cycle never includes event6, so event6 is not guaranteed to occur in all possible valid sequences.

Therefore C1 (""Event6 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e., after event1, event2 must occur.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, C1 is true.)

Step 2 — examine the rules
- From event1 the context says: ""After event1, either event2, event3, event4, event5, event8, or event9 must happen."" That allows event3 (and others) as possible successors; event2 is not guaranteed.
- From event4 (the initial event) the next event must be either event3 or event8.

Step 3 — counterexample showing C1 is false (so C2 is false)
- C1 requires that whenever event1 happens, event2 happens. But the rules permit a transition event1 → event3. That is a valid successor where event2 does not happen, so C1 is false.
- Because C1 is false in general, it cannot be true in the next state. Thus C2 is false.

- C1: ""Event9 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event8 happens and C1 holds"" = event8 happens AND event9 never happens.

Step 2 — what the context gives
- The context explicitly says ""Initially, event8 happened."" So ""event8 happens"" is true (at least initially).
- The context also gives allowed successor events, e.g. after event8 → {2,5,6}; after event5 → {2,6,7,9}; etc.

Step 3 — can event9 be avoided in all possible sequences?
- No. There is a valid sequence that leads to event9: start at 8 (given), then choose 5 (8 → 5 is allowed), then choose 9 (5 → 9 is allowed). That produces event9.
- Since event9 can occur in a sequence consistent with the rules, the statement ""Event9 does not happen"" (C1) is not guaranteed by the context.

Conclusion
- Because C1 is not entailed, C2 (""event8 happens AND event9 does not happen"") is not guaranteed. Therefore the hypothesis C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""if event9 happens, then event7 happens."" But the rules give after event9: either event7 or event8 must happen. So event9 can lead to event8 instead of event7.
- From event8 the rules allow event9 (after event8 one possible next event is event9). Therefore there is a cycle 9 -> 8 -> 9 -> 8 ... that never produces event7.
- Starting from the initial event6 we can reach event9 (after event6 choose event9) and hence reach event8 and enter the 9↔8 loop, avoiding event7 indefinitely. This is a concrete counterexample to C1.
- C2 says ""if event8 happens, then C1 holds."" But since from event8 we can go to event9 and then back to event8 without ever getting event7, C1 does not hold after event8. Thus C2 is false."

Step 3 — evaluate C2 for the next state:
- event2 is not an allowed immediate successor of event2, so ""event2 happens"" in the next state cannot hold.
- That leaves C2 true only if event8 certainly happens next.

From the rules:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4 we may choose event8.
- After event8 we may choose event2.
- After event2 we may choose event1 (or 4 or 8), none of which force event5.

So one valid trace is: 4 → 8 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 8 → 2 ... which repeatedly visits event2 while avoiding event5 forever. In that trace event2 occurs and event5 does not, so C1 is false and event5 is false, making C2 false.

- The problem statement explicitly says ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 is already true (it happens).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis: C2 is ( (event9 → event8) → event3 ). We must check whether assuming C1 (event9 → event8) forces event3 to be true given the rules and the initial fact that event9 happened.

- Treat the rules as implications on which events must hold if some event holds. From the context we have (among others):
  - Initially: event9 is true.
  - C1 (assumed): event9 → event8, so event8 is true.
  - event8 → (event1 ∨ event6 ∨ event7).
  - event1 → event9.
  - event9 → (event1 ∨ event3 ∨ event6).

- Construct a consistent assignment that satisfies all implications but does not make event3 true:
  - Let event9, event8, and event1 be true; all other events false.
  - Check implications:
    - For antecedent 9: (1 ∨ 3 ∨ 6) holds because event1 is true.
    - For antecedent 8: (1 ∨ 6 ∨ 7) holds because event1 is true.
    - For antecedent 1: event9 holds.
    - No other antecedents are true, so all required consequents are satisfied.
  - event3 is not forced in this model.

Because there exists a model (consistent with C1 and the given rules and initial event9) in which event3 does not happen, C1 does not imply event3. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., every possible sequence from the initial state eventually hits event4). C2 is its negation.
- From the context we can view events as states with allowed next events:
  - 5 -> {1,3,4,7,8}
  - 8 -> {2,4,6}
  - 2 -> {1,5,6}
  - 6 -> {2,4,5,8}
  - (others omitted for brevity)
- Starting at the initial event 5, choose 5 -> 8 (allowed).
- Then 8 -> 2 (allowed), 2 -> 6 (allowed), 6 -> 8 (allowed). This yields the cycle 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8 ...
- This cycle avoids event4 entirely, so there exists a valid infinite sequence in which event4 never happens.
- Therefore event4 is not guaranteed to always occur, C1 is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

</graphml>",0.0,"Hypothesis C2: ""If event7 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""If event5 happens, then event8 happens."" So C2 asserts that whenever event7 occurs, then (whenever event5 occurs later) event8 must occur.

Step 1 — inspect rules (deduplicated):
- Start: event3.
- 3 -> {2,4,5}
- 2 -> {4,7,9}
- 4 -> {1,5,7,8,9}
- 7 -> {2,4,5,6}
- 5 -> {4,9}
- 9 -> {1,2,3,4,6,7,8}
- 1 -> {3,4,5,6,7,9}
- 6 -> {3,5,7,9}
- 8 -> {6}

Step 2 — is C1 true (globally)? From 5 you can go to 4, and from 4 you can choose transitions that avoid 8 (for example 4->7->2->4...). So it is possible to visit 5 and then forever avoid 8. Thus C1 is false.

Step 3 — is C2 true (if 7 happens then C1 holds)? We need a counterexample: a run where 7 happens, later 5 happens, but 8 never happens. Starting from initial 3:
3 -> 4 -> 7 (so event7 happens). From 7 take 2, then 4, then 5:
3,4,7,2,4,5.
After 5 go to 4 again and loop 4->7->2->4 indefinitely. This path contains event7 and later event5, but never includes event8. Therefore C2 is false.

- C1: ""Event6 always happens"" (i.e., in every allowed sequence starting from the initial event, event6 must occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not true that event6 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- From 5 → {3,4,6,8,9}
- From 3 → {2,5,9}
- From 4 → {3}
- From 8 → {3,4,5,7}

Step 3 — find a sequence avoiding event6
- Start: event5 (given).
- From 5, choose event3 (allowed).

- Repeat 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 … indefinitely.

Step 2 — use the rules for what can happen after event8:
- The context repeatedly states: ""After event8, either event1, event5, or event9 must happen.""
- Therefore the next state (immediately after the initial event8) can only be event1, event5, or event9.

- C1: Event2 does not happen (i.e., event2 never occurs).
- C2: If event3 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., whenever event3 occurs, event2 does not occur).

Step 2 — Examine transitions (summary):
- start: event8 happens.
- From 8 → {1,3,4,6}
- From 3 → {1,6,9}
- From 9 → {1,2,4,5,6,7,8}
(and other transitions exist but these are the relevant ones)

Step 3 — Find a counterexample to C2:
- Path: 8 → 3 → 9 → 2
  - event3 happens (at the second step),
  - then event9 can occur,
  - from event9 event2 is allowed.
- This trace has both event3 and later event2, so C1 is false in that trace, making the implication in C2 false.

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event9.
- C1 is the propositional implication ""if event4 happens, then event9 happens."" An implication is true in any state where the antecedent (event4) is false, or the consequent (event9) is true.
- In the successor state event1, event4 is false, so C1 is vacuously true there.
- In the successor state event9, event9 is true, so C1 is true there as well.
- Since C1 holds in every possible next state, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 states: ""If event7 happens, then event4 happens."" Interpreting this in the same sense as the context (i.e. ""after event7, event4 must happen""), we check the rule given: ""After event7, either event3, event4, event6, or event9 must happen."" Since event3, event6 or event9 are allowed alternatives, event4 is not forced. A simple immediate counterexample is the allowed transition 7 -> 3. So C1 is false.

- C2 states: ""C1 holds or event8 happens."" For C2 to be true, at least one of the disjuncts must be guaranteed. We already showed C1 does not hold. Is event8 guaranteed to occur at some point? No — from the initial event3 you may repeatedly choose the path 3 -> 7 -> 3 -> 7 -> ... (each step allowed by the rules), never taking any transition to event8. Thus there is an allowed execution in which neither C1 holds nor event8 ever happens.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the given rules and is False."

Interpretation:
- C1 = ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens"" (i.e. every time event4 occurs it must be followed by event5).
- C2 = ""If event8 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. whenever event8 occurs, it must be the case that every occurrence of event4 is followed by event5.

Counterexample (follows the given transitions):
1. Initially event1 happens.
2. After event1, event8 is allowed (so take event8).
3. After event8, event4 is allowed (so take event4).
4. After event4, event3 is allowed (so take event3).

This yields a valid sequence 1 → 8 → 4 → 3 where event4 is followed by event3 (not event5). Thus C1 is false in a run that includes event8, so C2 (which requires C1 to hold whenever event8 happens) is false.

From the context:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, one option is event8.
- After event8, one option is event4.

Thus there is a valid sequence: event3 (initial) -> event8 -> event4. In this sequence both event8 and event4 occur, so C1 holds. Therefore C2 (the negation) is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The initial state is event7.
- The rules specify what events can occur immediately after each event.
- The rule for event7 is: ""After event7, either event1, event2, event4, event5, or event8 must happen.""
- Event3 is not listed as a possible next event after event7, so ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (C1) cannot be true.
- Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 = ""Event3 does not happen"". C2 = ""Event1 happens OR C1 holds"" (i.e. Event1 happens or Event3 never happens).
- To show C2 is not necessarily true, give a valid sequence (consistent with the rules) where Event3 happens and Event1 never happens, which makes C2 false.
- Start: event8 (given). Choose successors to avoid event1:
  - 8 -> 3 (allowed)
  - 3 -> 2 (allowed)
  - 2 -> 4 (allowed)
  - 4 -> 3 (allowed)
  - Repeat the cycle 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 ...
- This sequence is allowed by the rules, contains event3, and never contains event1. So Event3 does happen (C1 false) and Event1 does not happen, making C2 false.

Therefore C2 is False."

- Start at initial event8.
- 8 → 3 (allowed).
- 3 → 1 (allowed) — so event1 happens.
- 1 → 5 (allowed).
- 5 → 9 (allowed) — event9 occurs after event1.

- Initially event5 happened.
- The rules state: after event5, either event3 or event9 must happen (no rule allows event8 immediately after event5).
- Therefore in the next state (the immediate successor of the initial state) the event will be either event3 or event9, so event8 does not happen in that next state.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 asserts: event5 happens and event6 happens.
- From the context, event5 already happened initially, so C1 would require that event6 also happens later.
- The rules allow nondeterministic choices after each event. From event5 we can choose event1 (allowed). From event1 we can choose event4 (allowed). From event4 we can choose event1 again (allowed). This yields the infinite loop 5 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 ... which never produces event6.
- Because there is a valid sequence of allowed events that never includes event6, C1 is not guaranteed to hold. Therefore its negation C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Given: Initially event5 happened. The rule ""After event5, either event1, event4, event6, or event7 must happen."" Those are the only allowed immediate successors of the initial event5. None of those successors is event5, so in every possible next state event5 does not occur. Therefore C1 holds in the next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" — an implication whose consequent is ""event4 happens.""
- From the context, initially event4 happened. So the statement ""event4 happens"" is already true.
- In logic, an implication is true when its consequent is true (regardless of the antecedent). Since ""event4 happens"" is true, the implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is true.

- From event3 one possible next event is event8 (after 3 → {1,2,4,5,8}).

Thus we have the cycle 8 → 3 → 8 reachable from the start via 9 → 1 → 8. By repeating that cycle, event8 can occur infinitely often. Therefore it is not true that “event8 does not happen” eventually (i.e., from some point on never happens). Hence C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 occurred (given).
- After event5 one of {1,4,7,9} must occur. Choose event1 (allowed).
- After event1 one of {2,5,7} must occur. Choose event5 (allowed).
- Now we have a cycle 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ... that satisfies all ""after"" constraints and never includes event7.
- Therefore event5 does happen (initially) and it is possible for event7 to never happen, so C2 (""Event5 happens and Event7 does not happen"") is True."

</graphml>",1.0,"We interpret C1 as the proposition ""event8 does not happen (at the current step)"". C2 is the temporal claim ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future step there is a state where event8 does not happen).

1. Initial condition: event8 happened at the initial step.
2. Look at the rule(s) for what must happen after event8: ""After event8, either event1, event4, event5, event6, event7, or event9 must happen."" Notice event8 is not in this list.
3. Therefore the very next step after the initial event8 must be one of {1,4,5,6,7,9} — i.e., not event8. That next state satisfies C1.
4. Since there exists a future step (immediately the next one) where C1 holds, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

Find a counterexample run starting from the initial event4:

- 4 -> 5 (after event4, event5 is allowed)
- 5 -> 1 (after event5, event1 is allowed) — now event1 has happened
- 1 -> 7 (after event1, event7 is allowed)
- 7 -> 6 (after event7, event6 is allowed) — now event6 has happened as well

This run contains both event1 and event6, so the implication ""if event6 happens then event1 does not happen"" is false.

- C1: event1 and event4 both occur.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens (i.e., whenever event1 and event4 occur, event2 must occur).

Step 2 — use the rules to find a counterexample execution
- Initially event1 has happened.
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed: after event1 → event2, event3, event5, or event6).
- From event3 choose event4 (allowed: after event3 → event4, event7, event8, or event9).
  Now both event1 and event4 have occurred, so C1 holds.
- After event4, event5 must happen (rule: after event4 → event5).
- After event5 we may choose event4 again (allowed: after event5 → event4, event6, or event8).
- Repeat 4 → 5 → 4 indefinitely. This execution never forces event2.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence where C1 holds (event1 and event4 occur) but event2 never occurs, the implication in C2 does not necessarily hold.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event7 occurs.
- After event7, event8 is allowed to happen.
- After event8, event6 is allowed to happen.
- So a valid sequence is: event7 → event8 → event6, which satisfies C1 (both event6 and event8 happen).
- Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 states: whenever event5 happens, event3 happens next. The transition rule after event5 lists many options: event1, event2, event3, event4, event7, event8, or event9. So event5 can be followed by event1 (or others) instead of event3 — C1 does not hold universally from the start.
- C2 states that C1 eventually holds (i.e., there is a point after which every occurrence of event5 is followed by event3). To refute C2 it suffices to find a reachable infinite run in which some occurrence of event5 is repeatedly followed by a non-3 successor, so C1 never becomes true from some point onward.
- Construct a reachable run: start at event3 (given), take 3 -> 4 (allowed), 4 -> 8 (allowed), 8 -> 5 (allowed). Now from event5 choose 1 (allowed), and from event1 choose 5 (allowed), giving the loop ...5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ... In that loop every occurrence of event5 is followed by event1 (not event3), so C1 is violated forever along that run.
- Because such a run exists, C1 does not eventually hold in all executions.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning, step by step:
- C1 is simply ""Event9 happens"" (the disjunction ""event9 or event9"" is just event9).
- C2 is the negation: ""Event9 does not happen"".
- From the context we start at event1. A valid sequence is 1 -> 5 -> 9 because after event1 event5 may happen, and after event5 event9 may happen. Thus there exists a valid execution where event9 happens, so C1 can be true.
- Since C1 can hold, its negation C2 is not true in all models. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context we have states 1–9 with transitions:
  - 4 -> {5,7,8,9}
  - 5 -> {4,6,7}
  - 6 -> {7,8}
  - 8 -> {1,2,4,6}
  - (and others, but these are the relevant ones)
- C1 says ""event8 does not happen"" (i.e., 8 never occurs). C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., from some point onward, 8 never occurs).
- Starting at 4, one can choose 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 ... forever. This avoids 8, so C1 can hold (there exist runs where 8 never happens).
- However, C2 asserts inevitability (that eventually 8 will stop happening on all runs). That is not guaranteed: there is a run 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> 8 -> 6 -> ... that keeps producing event8 forever (8 and 6 form a cycle).

Reasoning: The premises state ""Initially, event3 happened"" and also ""After event3, either event1, event5, event6, event7, event8, or event9 must happen."" Because event7 is explicitly one of the allowed successors of event3, it is possible for event7 to occur. Therefore you cannot conclude ""event7 does not happen"" (C1) from the premises, so the implication ""if event3 happens then C1 holds"" (C2) is not entailed. Hence C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event7 happened.
- From event7 the allowed next events include event9 (7 -> 9).
- From event9 the allowed next events include event2 (9 -> 2).
- From event2 the allowed next events include event1 (2 -> 1).
- Thus there is a valid sequence 7 → 9 → 2 → 1 in which both event9 and event1 occur, so C1 holds and therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false."

- (other nodes all have at least one successor that is not 7)

Note that 3 -> 4 and 4 -> 3, so once we reach 3 or 4 we can cycle 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 ... forever without ever taking a transition to 7. For example: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... avoids event7 indefinitely.

Thus event7 is not unavoidable; C1 (""Event7 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

From the rules:
- Initially event6 happened.
- 6 -> {1,2,9}
- 1 -> {2,3,6,7}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,5,8}
- 3 can be reached from 1, and 4 can be reached from 3.

Construct a valid sequence: 6 (initial) -> 1 (allowed from 6) -> 3 (allowed from 1) -> 4 (allowed from 3). In this sequence both event3 and event4 occur, so C1 can be satisfied.

Therefore C1 is not ruled out, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Reasoning: start at event6 (given). From event6 we can go to event7 (6 → 7). From event7 we can go to event5 (7 → 5). Thus there is a valid sequence where both event7 and event5 happen, so C1 can hold. Therefore the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not true."

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 happens. From event8, event3 is allowed (8 -> 3).
- From event3, event4 is allowed (3 -> 4). So we can have 8, 3, 4.
- From event4, event7 is allowed (4 -> 7). So we can extend to 8, 3, 4, 7.
- This trace contains both event4 and event7, so the implication ""if event4 happens then event7 does not happen"" is violated.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event9 happened (given).
- After event9 one of {2,3,4,5,8} must happen. Choose event5 (allowed).
- After event5 one of {1,4,7} must happen. Choose event1 (allowed).
- After event1 one of {3,5} must happen. Choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3 one of {2,5,6,7} must happen. Choose event7 (allowed).
- After event7 one of {1,5,6} must happen. Choose event1 (allowed).

This yields a cycle 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 that can repeat indefinitely and never includes event9. Thus event9 is not forced to always happen (C1 is false), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

- Start: event6.

- 4 → {3,6,8,9}

- C2 is the statement ""Event5 happens or C1 holds.""  
- C1 is ""Event9 happens and Event2 happens.""  
So C2 is true iff either Event5 happens, or both Event9 and Event2 happen.

Step 2 — use the context
- The context begins with ""Initially, event5 happened."" That directly makes ""Event5 happens"" true.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since Event5 happens is true, the disjunction in C2 is true regardless of C1.

- C1: ""Event9 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (unique ones):

- 1 -> {2,3,5,6,9}
- 2 -> {4,6,7,8,9}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,6,8}

- From the initial event1 we may choose 3 (1 -> 3 is allowed).
- From 3 we may choose 8 (3 -> 8 is allowed).
- From 8 we may choose 3 (8 -> 3 is allowed).
- Thus we can repeat 3,8,3,8,... forever. None of the transitions in this cycle include event9.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 states: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2 is the negation: ""C1 does not hold.""

From the rules: initially event9 happens. After event9, event3 must happen. After event3 one allowed next event is event9. So there is a valid infinite trace 9 → 3 → 9 → 3 → ... that never includes event1. Therefore event1 is not guaranteed to occur, so C1 is false. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

- After event1 one of {event4, event5, event6} must happen. Choose event4.
- After event4 one of {event1, event3, event5, event9} must happen. Choose event1 again.

This yields a valid infinite sequence 8 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... in which event1 occurs but neither event5 nor event6 ever occurs. That single possible run shows ""If event1 happens then (event5 and event6 happen)"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (E2 ∨ E1).
- C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"", i.e. E1 → (E2 ∨ E1).
- For any proposition p and q, p → (p ∨ q) is a tautology: if p is true then p ∨ q is necessarily true.

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event5 is allowed (choices: 2, 3, 5, 8).
- After event5, event9 is allowed (choices include 9).
- After event9, the next event can be event5 (allowed choices after event9: 5, 6, or 8).

Thus event9 can be followed by event5, so event9 does not guarantee that event8 happens next. Therefore C2 is false."

Counterexample (from the given rules): initially event2 happens. From event2 we may choose event9 (allowed). After event9 we may choose event5 (explicitly allowed).

From the rules:
- Start: event5.
- After event5 → {4, 9}. Choose 4.
- After event4 → {1,2,3,5,8,9}. Choose 8.
Thus we reach event8 while having avoided event7 so far.

After event8 → {1,5,6,7}. To avoid event7 forever, always choose one of the other options (for example, loop 8 → 1 → 4 → 8 ... using 1 → 4 or 8 and 4 → 8), none of which force a visit to 7. All states that list 7 as an option also have other non-7 options, so one can construct an infinite run containing event8 but never containing event7.

Therefore there exists a run in which event8 occurs and event7 never occurs, so C2 = (not event8) OR event7 is not guaranteed. Final answer: False."

- C1: Event8 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event7 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — Relevant facts from the scenario
- The scenario explicitly states: ""Initially, event7 happened."" So event7 has already occurred at the start.
- Other transition rules (which events can follow others) are irrelevant to the truth of ""event7 happens"" once we know event7 already occurred.

Step 3 — Evaluate the implication
- An implication ""If C1 then event7"" is true whenever event7 is true (regardless of C1). Since event7 already happened initially, the consequent is true, so the implication holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event: event2 happens.
- From event2 we may choose event4 (since after event2 one option is event4).
- From event4 we may choose event6 (since after event4 one option is event6). At this point event6 has happened, so C1 (""event6 does not happen"") is false.
- From event6 we may choose event2, and then from event2 choose event3, and from event3 choose event2, etc. These choices avoid ever selecting event7 (each successor choice has alternatives that do not include 7).
- Therefore there is a valid sequence in which event6 occurs and event7 never occurs. In that sequence C1 is false and event7 is false, so the disjunction C2 (""event7 happens or C1 holds"") is false.

Because a counterexample execution exists, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules — answer: False."

Reasoning:
- From the context: ""After event1, either event2, event4, event5, event8, or event9 must happen."" Event6 is not listed as a required option after event1.
- Therefore it is possible for event1 to occur without event6 following (for example: event1 → event2).
- So the claim C1 (""If event1 happens, then event6 happens"") does not hold.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Start: event7. From the rules:
- After event7 you may choose event2 (7 -> 2).
- After event2 you may choose event4 (2 -> 4).
- After event4 you may choose event2 (4 -> 2).

Thus there is a valid infinite loop 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... that never includes event1. Therefore event1 is not guaranteed to occur, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- From the rules we can follow a path that never visits event2. For example: 9 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 ... cycles among {1,3,4} and never hits 2. So C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.

- To test C2 (""If event7 happens, then C1 holds""), we need a run in which event7 occurs but C1 does not hold. Such a run exists: 9 -> 4 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... This run contains event7 but never contains event2, so C1 fails even though 7 happened.

Thus C2 is false."

- 2 -> {3,4,6,9}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,5,8,9}
- 4 -> {1,3,6,8,9}
- 5 -> {1,2,6,7,8}
- 6 -> {1,3,4,5,7,8}
- 7 -> {2,6,9}
- 8 -> {1,3,7}
- 9 -> {3,5,7,8}

Starting from the initial event5, we can reach event4: e.g. 5 -> 2 -> 4. From event4, it is not forced to go to 8; 4 can go to 1, and then 1 -> 2 and 2 -> 4, yielding the infinite cycle 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... which never visits 8. Thus there exists a valid execution where event4 occurs but event8 never happens.

Therefore C2 is False."

- C1: “Event1 happens and event5 happens.”
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., not(C1)).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules.

Step 2 — relevant rules
- Initially event8 happened.
- After event8, one of {1,2,4,5,9} must happen.
- After event1, one of {5,6,7,9} must happen.
- After event5, one of {2,3,9} must happen.
(Other rules are irrelevant to showing possibility/impossibility of 1 and 5.)

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence containing both event1 and event5
- Start: 8 (given).
- Choose after 8 → event1 (allowed).
- After event1 → event5 (allowed).
Thus the sequence 8 → 1 → 5 is permitted by the rules, so both event1 and event5 can occur.

Conclusion
- C1 can hold, so C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is not true.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- From the context, after event1 the allowed next events include event7.
- After event7 the allowed next events include event3.
- After event3 the allowed next events include event7 (as well as event4,8,9).
- So there is a valid loop 1 -> 7 -> 3 -> 7 -> 3 -> ... that never visits event4.
- That shows C1 (""event4 always happens"") is false (there is a run with no event4), and hence C2 (""if event7 happens then C1 holds"") is also false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens. From event1 we can choose event2 (to avoid event3).
- From event2 we can choose event6 (to avoid event9).
- From event6 we can choose event1 (to avoid event3 and event9).
- This yields an infinite cycle 1 → 2 → 6 → 1 that never includes event3 or event9.

Thus C1 (""event3 or event9 happens"") is not forced by the rules (there is at least one valid execution avoiding both), and so the claim C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not universally entailed either. The question asks whether C2 is true given the context; it is not — answer: False."

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- C1 says event2 always happens. To test C2 we assume C1 and see if event6 must follow.
- From the rules, after event3 one possible next is event2, and after event2 one possible next is event3. Also 1 -> 4 -> 3 is allowed from the start, so we can reach 2 without ever using event6.
- Construct a valid infinite trace that satisfies C1 but never uses event6:
  1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> ...
  Every step here is permitted by the given rules, event2 occurs repeatedly, and event6 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 does not force event6 to happen, so C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says “Event3 does not happen.” C2 says “C1 eventually holds” (i.e., there comes a time after which event3 never occurs).
- We must check whether, given the allowed transitions from the context, it is necessarily the case that eventually event3 stops occurring.
- From the context: after event6 (the initial event) event3 is allowed. After event3 you can go to event1; after event1 you can go to event4; and after event4 you can go back to event3. Concretely: 6 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 is a valid loop.
- That loop shows event3 can occur repeatedly (infinitely). Therefore it is not guaranteed that there will be a time after which event3 never occurs.
- Because there exists a valid execution in which event3 keeps occurring, C2 is not entailed.

Thus C2 is False."

Counterexample run:
- Start at event1 (given).
- From event1 go to event5 (1 → 5 is allowed).
- From event5 go to event3 (5 → 3).
- From event3 go to event2 (3 → 2).
- From event2 go back to event3 (2 → 3), and repeat 2 ↔ 3 forever.

1) Identify C1: ""If event8 happens, then event4 happens."" That is a universal conditional about what must follow event8.

2) Check the rules for event8: The context explicitly says ""After event8, either event1, event4, event5, event6, or event7 must happen."" That permits event1 (and others) after event8; event4 is only one of several options. So C1 (that event4 must happen after event8) is not entailed.

Reasoning (concise):
- Hypothesis C2 says C1 (""Event9 does not happen"") always holds.
- From the rules: after event1 one of {event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7, event9} must happen.
- The allowed transition event1 -> event9 is explicit, so there is a valid sequence where event9 occurs (e.g., start at event1, then event9).

Reasoning (brief):
- Initial event7 has occurred, so C1 would require event5 to occur at some point (event7 is already satisfied).
- From event7 one may choose event1 (since 1 is an allowed successor).
- From event1 one may choose event7 (since 7 is an allowed successor).
- Thus the infinite trace 7 → 1 → 7 → 1 → ... is allowed and never includes event5.
- Therefore event5 is not inevitable, so ""C1 always holds"" is false."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 requires both that event9 happens at some point and that event1 eventually happens.
- We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed (i.e., follows from the rules given the initial event3).

Step 2 — extract relevant rules (unique)
- initially: event3
- 3 -> {2,8}
- 2 -> {6,7}
- 6 -> {1,2,3,7,8}
- 7 -> {1,4,6,9}
- 4 -> {1,5,9}
- 1 -> {6,7,8}
- 8 -> {2,5,6,7}
- 5 -> {1,8}
- 9 -> {3,4,5,7,8}

Step 3 — find a counterexample (an infinite trace avoiding event9)
- From initial 3 choose 2 (allowed: 3 -> 2).
- From 2 choose 6 (allowed: 2 -> 6).
- From 6 choose 3 (allowed: 6 -> 3).
- This yields the cycle 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> ... which never visits event9 (nor need it to continue).
- Because there is a valid infinite trace that never includes event9, event9 is not guaranteed to happen. Likewise, event1 is avoidable on this trace (6 can choose 3 instead of 1).

Conclusion
- C2 (""event9 happens and event1 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed from the initial condition and rules.

Reasoning summary:
- From event1 (which happened initially) the allowed next events include event2.
- From event2 the allowed next events include event1.
- Thus there is a cycle 1 → 2 → 1 that avoids event9 entirely.
- By repeatedly choosing those transitions, you can produce an infinite run with no occurrence of event9.
- Therefore ""Event9 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed, so C1 does not hold and C2 is True."

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 just says event8 occurs.
- C2 claims event8 always occurs on every possible run.
- From the rules: after event3 you can have event1; after event1 you can have event3. Starting initially at event3, the sequence 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... is allowed and never contains event8.

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning: in the state one step after the initial state, event4 is guaranteed to eventually happen.

Step 2 — initial and immediate successors
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be one of {event2, event4, event6, event8}.

Step 3 — check each possible next state
- If the next state is event4, then C1 trivially holds there.
- If the next state is event2, the allowed next events are {event3, event4, event6, event7}. But there is a possible infinite loop 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... that never reaches event4. So from state event2, event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen.
- If the next state is event6, one can move 6 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... and again avoid event4 indefinitely.
- If the next state is event8, one can go 8 → 6 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... and similarly avoid event4 forever.

Because there exist next states (e.g., event2, event6, event8) from which event4 may never occur, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state.

Reasoning (stepwise):
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" means from some point onward every step is event1 (i.e., the trace is constantly event1).
- Initially event3 happened, so C1 does not hold at the start.
- Look at the transition rule for event1: after event1 the next event must be one of {4,5,7,8,9} — event1 is not an allowed successor of itself.
- Therefore you can never have two consecutive event1 steps, so it is impossible that from some time onward every step is event1.

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (i.e., there is some future point at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is itself a statement about the future, C2 means there is some (possibly current) point in time at which C1 is true.

Step 2 — follow the constraints from the initial event
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, event9 must happen (5 → 9).
- After event9, one allowed next event is event2 (9 → 2).

Thus there is a path 5 → 9 → 2, so event2 can occur. Therefore C1 is true (event2 eventually happens).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C1 is already true from the initial state (we have a concrete future where event2 occurs), so there exists a time (the initial time) at which C1 holds. Hence C2 is true.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened. The rules say: after event2 the next event must be one of {event1, event4, event5, event6, event9}.
- C1 asserts ""event8 or event6 happens.""
- In the immediate next state after event2, event6 is possible but not guaranteed (event1, event4, event5, or event9 could occur instead). Event8 is not among the mandatory successors of event2.
- Because not all possible next states satisfy C1, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 (""if event8 happens then event4 happens"") is true: event4 has already happened initially, so any run in which event8 later occurs still has event4 true (the implication holds).
- Event1 is not guaranteed. From the initial event4 you can choose 4 -> 5 and then 5 -> 4 and repeat forever, never visiting event1. Thus a run exists with no event1.

Because event1 need not occur, the conjunction in C2 fails. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event5 eventually happens"" — interpreted as saying event5 must occur on every possible sequence starting from the initial state.
- We start at event4 (given).
- From event4 one allowed successor is event3; from event3 one allowed successor is event4. So 4 -> 3 -> 4 is a valid loop.
- This loop can be repeated indefinitely, producing an infinite execution that never visits event5.
- Therefore event5 is not inevitable; C1 is false.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event5 does not inevitably happen). That statement is true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened. From the rule for event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5, event6, event7, event9}.
- C2 asserts that in that next state, C1 holds — i.e., from that next state event4 must occur in the subsequent (one-step) state.
- But if the next event is event1 (which is allowed), then by the rule for event1 the following event must be in {event5, event6} — event4 is not among them.
- Therefore there is an allowed run where, after the initial event4, the next state does not have event4 as its immediate successor, so C1 does not hold in that next state.
- Hence C2 is not true."

Reasoning: model the events as a directed graph of allowed successors. From the given rules (deduplicated):

- 4 -> {3,6,7,8,9}
- 3 -> {1,7,8,9}

- 8 -> {1,2,6,7,9}
- 9 -> {2,4,5,7,8}

- 7 -> {1,3,4,8,9}

Starting at 6, there is a path that never reaches event2 or event7: 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> ... (looping on 1-4-3). None of 1,3,4 is 2 or 7, and all transitions used are allowed.

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens."" (i.e., at some point in the future).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event5 never happens).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules and the initial event1.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (summary)
- 1 → {2,3,4,5,6,7}
- 2 → {3,5,6,7,8}
- 3 → {2,4}
- 4 → {1,3,7}
- 5 → {2,3,4,6,9}
- 6 → {3,7}
- 7 → {5,8}
- 8 → {1,5}
- 9 → {3,5,7,8}

Step 3 — can we avoid event5 forever?
Yes. From the initial 1 we can choose transitions that never go to 5 and form a loop. Example infinite cycle avoiding 5:
1 → 2 → 6 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 6 → 3 → 4 → 1 → ...
Each step is allowed by the rules:
- 1→2 allowed
- 2→6 allowed
- 6→3 allowed
- 3→4 allowed
- 4→1 allowed
This cycle repeats forever and never visits event5.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists an infinite execution starting from event1 that never reaches event5, ""Event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

- C1 says: ""Event9 happens and event3 happens"" (both occur).
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, both event9 and event3 occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules and the current state
- Initially event7 happened.
- The rule after event7: either event1, event3, event6, or event9 must happen. That specifies which single event occurs in the next state (one of {1,3,6,9}).

Step 3 — reason about C2
- The next state after event7 can contain at most one of those events (the rules present a single choice), so it cannot simultaneously contain both event3 and event9.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" That claims event4 must occur whenever event1 occurs.
- From the context: after event5 (initial) event1 is allowed; after event1 one allowed next event is event9; after event9 one allowed next event is event7; after event7 one allowed next event is event1. So there is a cycle 5 → 1 → 9 → 7 → 1 → 9 → 7 → ... that never forces event4 to occur (each choice stays within the allowed options and avoids 4).
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (counterexample path where event1 happens but event4 never happens), so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts both ""event3 happens"" and C1 holds. Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true. (Also the cycle above avoids event3, so event3 is not forced either.)

Thus C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 means ""event8 always happens"" (i.e., every step is event8).
- From the rules: after event8 the next event must be one of {2,3,5,7,9} — event8 is not allowed to follow itself.
- Therefore you cannot have two consecutive event8 occurrences, so C1 is already violated immediately after the initial event8.
- For C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") to be true, there would need to be some future point after which every event is event8. That requires being able to have event8 follow event8 indefinitely, which is impossible because 8→8 is not permitted.
- Hence C2 is false."

- C2: ""C1 holds and event4 happens."" So C2 requires event6 to not happen and event4 to happen.

Step 2 — examine the given facts:

- Since event6 did happen initially, the statement ""event6 does not happen"" (C1) is false.

From event4 the allowed next events are {2,3,8,9}. Observe the set S = {1,2,3,4,8,9} is closed under the allowed transitions (every allowed successor of any node in S includes at least one member of S, so we can always choose a successor inside S):
- after 4 → {2,3,8,9} ⊆ S
- after 3 → {1,2,8,9,7} has {1,2,8,9} ⊆ S
- after 1 → {2,3,5,6,7,9} has {2,3,9} ⊆ S
- after 2 → {1,3,5,7,9} has {1,3,9} ⊆ S
- after 8 → {1,3,4,7,9} has {1,3,4,9} ⊆ S
- after 9 → {1,2,4,7,8} has {1,2,4,8} ⊆ S

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event2 (given).
- From 2 you can go to 3 (since 2 -> {3,4,5,7,8}).
- From 3 you can go to 1 (3 -> {1,4,5,8}).
- From 1 you can go back to 2 (1 -> {2,3,4,8,9}).

This gives an infinite loop 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that never visits event4. Since there exists a possible (allowed) execution that avoids event4 forever, the claim ""Event4 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning:
- Initially event7 happens.
- From ""after event7, either event2, event3, event5, event6, event8, or event9 must happen"", event2 is an allowed outcome.
- Thus it is possible for event2 to happen after event7, so C1 (event7 and event2) can hold.
- If C1 holds then C2 (C1 holds or event1 happens) holds.

Therefore C2 can be satisfied, so the answer is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened.
- From the rules: after event5, one possible next event is event9 (after event5, either event2, event4, event7, event8, or event9 must happen).
- Therefore there is a reachable next state where event9 happens, so C1 (""Event9 happens in the next state"") can hold immediately.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied."

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context: 1 -> {4,5,6,7} and 4 -> {1,6,7,8,9}.
- After the initial event1 we can choose event4 as the next event (allowed).
- From event4 we can choose event1, and then 4 again, etc., producing the infinite trace 1,4,1,4,1,4,... that never contains event6.
- Therefore ""Event6 always happens"" does not hold in the next state (there is a next-state path avoiding event6), so C2 is False."

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the current state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, the next state is event2).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 the allowed next events are {event2, event3, event4, event5, event7} (the rule “After event6, either …”).
- Those choices are nondeterministic — the rules permit any one of those, not mandate event2.

Step 3 — counterexample showing C1 (and hence C2) fails
- From the initial event6 we may choose event3 as the next event (allowed by the rule). That makes C1 false in the initial step (the next state is event3, not event2).

- C1 asserts: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate successor state is event3).
- Initially event2 happened. From the rules for ""after event2"", the immediate next event must be one of {event1, event4, event5, event9}.
- Event3 is not among those immediate successors, so C1 does not hold in the next state (for example, choose next = event1, which is allowed).

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — C1: True. The context states ""Initially, event8 happened,"" so ""event1 or event8"" is true (event8 holds).

Step 2 — Is event3 forced when C1 holds? No. From event8 one allowed successor is event9 (8 -> 9). From event9 allowed successors are event7 or event8 (9 -> 8 or 7). So you can choose 8 after 9 and loop: 8 -> 9 -> 8 -> 9 -> ... forever. None of these transitions ever require event6, and event3 only appears as a successor of event6. Therefore there exists a valid continuation starting from the initial event8 that never produces event6 and thus never produces event3.

Since C1 can hold while event3 does not happen, the implication ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is not guaranteed.

- After event6 the allowed next events include event1 (6 → 1).

Reasoning:
- The rules are nondeterministic choices after each event. C2 requires that event8 inevitably occurs (C1) and that event7 happens. Event7 does happen initially, so the question reduces to whether event8 must eventually occur on every possible path.
- From the initial event7 one can go to event1 (choices after 7: 1, 6, or 8). From event1 one can go to event5. From event5 one can return to event1. Thus there is a loop 7 → 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... that forever avoids event8.
- Because there exists a valid infinite execution that never produces event8, event8 is not guaranteed to eventually happen. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, and so C2 is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event7 occurred, so the ""next state"" must be one of the allowed successors of event7: event4, event5, or event6.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would require that from that next state onward every state/event is event1 (i.e., event1 is forced).
- From event4 a successor can be event2, event5, event7, or event9 (event1 is possible but not forced).
- From event5 a successor can be event2, event3, event6, or event9 (no requirement to go to event1).
- From event6 a successor can be event2, event3, event4, event5, or event8 (again, event1 is not forced).
- Because in each possible next state there are allowed transitions that are not event1, C1 does not hold in the next state.
Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning:

- From event3 we may go back to event2.
- Repeating 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 … yields an infinite trace that never contains event1.
- Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurred.
- From event5 the next event must be either event6 or event9.
- C1 asserts ""event7 or event8 happens."" Neither event6 nor event9 is event7 or event8.
- Thus C1 does not hold in the immediate next state (although event9 could lead to 7 or 8 in a later step). Therefore C2 is False."

Step 1 — identify relevant rule: initially event6 happened. The transition rule for event6 is: after event6, one of {event1, event2, event5, event7, event8, event9} must happen. Event4 is not in that set.

Step 2 — evaluate C1: From the initial state (event6), the next state cannot be event4, so C1 is false for the next state.

Step 3 — evaluate C2: Since C1 is already false in the immediate next state, it is not true that C1 always holds.

Reasoning:
- Initial state: event4 happened.
- The rule for after event4 is: the next event must be either event2 or event8.
- Therefore event4 cannot occur in the immediate next state, so C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds; since C1 is false in the next state, C2 is false."

Reasoning (brief):
- From the rules: 7 -> {1,2,5,6} and 1 -> {2,3,6,7,8}. In particular, 7 -> 1 and 1 -> 7 are allowed.
- Thus you can stay forever in the 7↔1 cycle (7,1,7,1,...) and never visit event4 (or event3).
- Therefore event4 is not guaranteed to occur (C1 is false), and event3 is not guaranteed to occur. Since C2 requires both event3 to happen and C1 to hold, C2 is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible continuation from the initial condition, both event4 and event1 occur.
- From the context, initial event6 happened. From event6 the allowed next events include event1 (6 -> 1). From event1 the allowed next events include event6 (1 -> 6). Thus the infinite trace 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, ... is valid.
- In that trace event1 occurs repeatedly but event4 never occurs. Therefore C1 is not true on that trace, so C1 does not hold in all possible executions.
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Key rules used:
- From event2: next is one of {event1, event3, event5, event8, event9}.
- From event3: next is one of {event6, event7, event9}.
- From event6: next is one of {event4, event5}.
- From event4: next is one of {event2, event5, event6}.

Counterexample path (always choosing allowed transitions) that avoids event9 and never has both event5 and event1:
- Start: event2
- Choose event3 (allowed from event2)
- Then choose event6 (allowed from event3)
- Then choose event4 (allowed from event6)
- Then from event4 choose event6 again, and repeat the cycle 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 → ...
This infinite path contains no event9, and it never contains event5 or event1, so C1 (event5 AND event1) never holds and event9 never occurs.

</graphml>",0.0,"You asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False. C1 says ""Event4 does not happen."" So C2 asserts that event4 does happen.

We can show a valid sequence starting from the initial event7 that never uses event4, so C1 can hold and therefore C2 is not guaranteed. For example:

- Start at event7 (given).
- Choose event1 next (7 → 1 is allowed).
- From event1 choose event6 (1 → 6 is allowed; the other option 4 is avoided).
- From event6 choose event9 (6 → 9 is allowed).
- From event9 choose event1 (9 → 1 is allowed).

Now repeat the cycle 1 → 6 → 9 → 1 indefinitely. Every transition used is allowed, and event4 never occurs in this sequence.

Because a valid sequence exists in which event4 never happens, C1 can be true, so C2 (that C1 does not hold) is not necessarily true. Therefore the correct answer is:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a material implication P → P.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- Any statement of the form P → P is a tautology; it is true in all cases (whenever P is true the consequent is the same P, and when P is false the implication is true vacuously).
- Therefore C1 is true regardless of the event rules given in the context.

- C1: ""Event9 always happens"" (i.e., in every allowed future from the start, 9 must occur).
- C2: ""Event8 happens and C1 holds."" We know event8 initially happened, so C2 is true only if C1 is true.

Step 2 — inspect the rules relevant to avoiding event9:
- From event8 the allowed next events include event2 (8 → 2).
- From event2 the allowed next events include event8 (2 → 8).
- Both of those transitions explicitly appear in the rules and avoid event9.

Step 3 — construct a valid infinite run that never hits 9:
- Start at the given initial event8, then go 8 → 2 → 8 → 2 → ... forever.
- Each step follows an allowed ""after event X, either ..."" choice, and no step ever uses event9.

Conclusion:
- Because there is a valid infinite sequence that never reaches event9, event9 is not guaranteed to always happen. So C1 is false, and therefore C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

We know event7 does happen initially. The question is whether event6 must also happen. It does not: there is a valid sequence that satisfies all given rules while never producing event6. For example:

- Initially event7 (given).
- After event7, event5 must happen.
- After event5, pick event3 (allowed).
- After event3, pick event9 (allowed).
- After event9, pick event2 (allowed).
- After event2, pick event5 (allowed).

This yields the cycle 7 → 5 → 3 → 9 → 2 → 5 → ... which respects all ""after"" rules and avoids event6 indefinitely. Because event6 is not inevitable, C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Look for a possible sequence starting at event9 that avoids events 2, 6, and 8 (if such a sequence exists then C2 is not guaranteed).

Valid transitions used:
- 9 -> 7 (allowed)
- 7 -> 1 (allowed)
- 1 -> 5 (allowed)
- 5 -> 4 (allowed)
- 4 -> 1 (allowed)

This yields the loop 9,7,1,5,4,1,5,4,... which never includes 2, 6, or 8. Thus there is a permissible run in which neither event2 nor event6 nor event8 ever happens. Therefore C2 is not necessarily true.

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context the transitions include: 9 -> {3,4,7,8}, 4 -> {3,5,7}, 3 -> {1,2,4,5,6,7,8}, 2 -> {3,4,5,7,9}, etc.
- Starting at 9, pick the allowed sequence 9 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 9. Each step is permitted (4->3, 3->2, 2->9), and none of these steps ever visits event5.
- By repeating this cycle indefinitely we obtain an infinite trace from the initial state that never reaches event5.
- Therefore ""Event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed on all possible traces, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Reasoning:
- Initially event9 happened. The rules say: after event9, either event2, event4, event5, event7, or event8 must happen (one of those).
- C1 says: ""If event5 happens, then event2 happens"" within a state.
- In the next state after the initial event9, it is allowed that event5 happens (choose event5) and that event2 does not happen (the choice is exclusive).
- That next state therefore has event5 true and event2 false, so the implication in C1 is violated there.
- Hence C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there exists a run where 1 occurs at some future point).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible run from the initial state (event7) event1 will eventually occur. We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the transition graph (edges read as ""from X → one of {...}"")
- From 7 → {1,2,3,4,8}
- From 2 → {1,5,6}
- From 6 → {4,5,8}
- From 4 → {1,2,3,6}
- (other edges exist but the above are sufficient for the argument)

Step 3 — reason about inevitability
- C1 is true as existence: e.g. 7 → 1 immediately gives a run where event1 happens.
- C2 requires that every possible run from 7 must eventually hit 1. To refute that, it suffices to give a possible infinite run that never visits 1.

Counterexample run avoiding event1:
- 7 → 2 (allowed)
- 2 → 6 (allowed)
- 6 → 4 (allowed)
- 4 → 6 (allowed)
- Repeat 6 → 4 → 6 → 4 … forever.
This infinite run never visits event1, so event1 is not inevitable.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" means that in every possible continuation from the initial condition, event3 will eventually occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" requires both that event3 is inevitable and that event1 occurs (at least in the considered run, but C1 must hold universally). For C2 to be true, C1 must be true.

Step 2 — examine the rules and the start
- Start: event6 has happened.
- From 6 the allowed next events are {1,4,5}.
- Relevant edges (omitting repeated rules): 1→{4,5,9}, 9→{1,2,6,7,8}, 6→{1,4,5}, etc.

Step 3 — find a continuation that avoids event3
- Consider the cycle 6 → 1 → 9 → 6:
  - 6 can go to 1,
  - 1 can go to 9,
  - 9 can go to 6.
- This cycle never visits event3, and because it is a valid loop we can repeat it indefinitely, producing an infinite continuation with no event3 ever occurring.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid continuation from the initial event that never includes event3, C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (which requires C1 to hold) is also false.

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 means ""event9 always happens"" (i.e., from some point onward every step is event9).
- But the transition rule after event9 is {2,3,5,6,7,8} — event9 is not allowed to follow event9. So you cannot have event9 at two consecutive steps, hence you cannot have event9 at every future step.
- Therefore C1 can never become true, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event7 occurred. From event7 the next event must be one of {3,4,5,6,9}. So C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false now because event2 is not among those.
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state — i.e., in that next state, event2 should happen in its following state. Check successors:
  - From 3 → successors {1,5,7,9} (no 2)
  - From 4 → successors {1,2,3,5,6,9} (2 possible)
  - From 5 → successors {2,4,6,7} (2 possible)
  - From 6 → successors {1,2,4,5} (2 possible)
  - From 9 → successors {1,3,6,7,8} (no 2)
- Some possible next states (3 or 9) do not allow event2 next, so C1 does not hold in every next state. Therefore C2 is not true."

Reasoning summary:
- C2 requires events 5, 8, and 9 to all occur (C2 = event5 AND (event9 AND event8)).
- From the context we only have nondeterministic successor rules, not that all successors must occur.
- Starting at event6, one possible sequence is 6 -> 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> ... (6 allows 2; 2 allows 6), which never produces events 5, 8, or 9.
- Because there exists a valid execution consistent with the rules where 5, 8, and 9 do not all happen, C2 is not entailed by the context.

Therefore C2 is False."

- From the rules: after event4 we can go to event8. After event8 we can go to event1. After event1 we can go to event2. After event2 we can go to event4. These transitions are explicitly allowed.
- That gives a cycle: 4 → 8 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → ... in which event8 occurs but event5 never occurs (neither immediately nor ever along that cycle).
- Therefore the claim ""If event8 happens, then event5 happens"" is not always true, so C2 is False."

Counterexample trace showing C2 can fail:
- Initially event6 happens.
- From event6 choose event1 (allowed: after 6 → {1,2,3,5}).
- From event1 choose event7 (allowed: after 1 → {2,7,9}).
- From event7 choose event4 (allowed: after 7 → {1,2,4,5,8}).
- From event4 choose event6 (allowed: after 4 → {1,2,5,6,7,8}).

This yields the cycle 6 → 1 → 7 → 4 → 6 → ... which never includes event2, event3, or event5. Thus it is possible that neither event2 nor event3 nor event5 ever happens, so C2 (event2 or event3 or event5) is not guaranteed. Therefore: False."

Examine C1:
- In propositional logic the implication P → P is always true (a tautology). It holds regardless of whether P (event3) actually occurs.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds, so the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.

From the context the transitions (omitting duplicates) are:

- 1 -> {2,3,4,5,6}
- 3 -> {1,2,8,9}

Initial event is 8. To refute C2 it suffices to exhibit a run consistent with the rules and C1 in which event1 never occurs. One simple cycle avoiding 1 is:

8 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 8 -> ... 

Check each step: 8 can go to 6; 6 -> 3; 3 -> 2; 2 -> 8. None of those steps require taking event1, and none uses event5 so C1 (5->4) does not force anything here. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, producing a valid execution in which event1 never happens.

Therefore C1 does not imply that event1 must occur. C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event6 happens or event9 happens."" C2 says that C1 eventually holds (i.e., that eventually event6 or event9 will occur).
- From the given rules: event2 → {1,3,4,6,7,8}; event1 → {3,4,5,6,9}; event3 → {1,4,5,6,9}.
- Starting at the initial event2, choose event1 (allowed). From event1 choose event3 (allowed). From event3 choose event1 (allowed). The pair 1 ↔ 3 is a valid cycle (1→3→1→3→...) that never goes to event6 or event9.
- Because there exists an infinite execution from the initial state that avoids both event6 and event9 forever, it is not guaranteed that event6 or event9 will eventually occur.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 says event7 always happens (i.e., in every possible sequence starting from event1).
- From the rules: 1 -> 4, 4 -> 5, 5 -> 1 is a valid cycle (none of these steps require event7).
- Starting at initial event1 we can follow 1 → 4 → 5 → 1 → ... forever, never encountering event7. Thus event7 is not inevitable, so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and event5 to happen). Even though event5 can occur (e.g., 1 → 4 → 5), because C1 is false the conjunction C2 is false."

C1 asserts: event1 happens in the next state. From the rule, event1 is one possible next event, but event4, event7, or event9 could instead occur. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (it may be true but is not forced).

C2 asserts: C1 holds or event6 happens in the next state. Given the possible next events after event5 are {event1, event4, event7, event9}, event6 is not among them, so the only way for C2 to be true would be if event1 necessarily occurs.

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event9 does not happen"" (i.e., the current event is not event9).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (the state immediately after the initial state).
- The initial event is event5. The rules state that after event5 the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4, event6, event7, event8, event9}.
- Because event9 is explicitly an allowed next event, it is possible that event9 happens in the next state. Therefore we cannot guarantee that ""event9 does not happen"" holds there.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start is event4.
- From event4 the possible next events include event5.
- From event5 the possible next events include event4.
- So we can choose the cycle 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ... indefinitely, never taking any transition to event9.
- Therefore event9 does not always happen (C1 is false), so the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Start from the given initial event4. From the rules:
- After event4 either event3 or event7 must happen.
- From event3 one allowed successor is event7.
- From event7 one allowed successor is event4.

So there is a valid cycle: 4 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 3 -> 7 -> ... . This cycle never produces event2, event1, or event9 (all choices used are allowed by the rules). Along this infinite (or indefinitely repeatable) path, event9 never happens, and event2 never happens, so C1 (which requires both event2 and event1) does not hold.

Because there exists a model/path consistent with the premises where neither C1 nor event9 occurs, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore the correct answer is:

- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (a material implication p → p)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event7 happens.""

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- The statement ""if event3 happens then event3 happens"" is a tautology (p → p). So C1 holds.

Step 3 — check whether event7 can occur starting from the given initial condition
- Initially event6 happened.
- After event6, event1 is one allowed successor.
- After event1, event7 is an allowed successor.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence: event6 → event1 → event7, so event7 can happen.

Step 4 — combine
- C1 holds (tautology) and event7 can occur, so C2 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""event6 happens in the next state"" (i.e. the immediate successor event is event6).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some future point at which the next event is event6).
- From the initial condition we have event7, and the allowed successors after event7 are {event1, event2, event5, event6, event9}.
- Therefore we can choose event6 as the next event (7 -> 6). That makes C1 true immediately, so C1 holds at that future point.
- Hence C2 (eventually C1) is satisfied.

Therefore C2 is True."

We ask whether C2 is true given the rules and the initial event3.

Find a valid event sequence starting from the initial event3 that avoids event7. From the rules:
- After event3 we can have event2.
- After event2 we can have event1.
- After event1 we can have event5.
- Event5 is terminal (no further events).

Thus one valid run is: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5, which never includes event7. That shows C1 can hold, so C1 does not necessarily fail.

- C2 = (C1 holds) OR (event3 happens).

We must decide whether C2 necessarily follows from the given facts and rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules and find a counterexample trace if possible:
- Initially event5 happens.
- From event5, event9 must happen. So we have 5 -> 9.
- From event9 one option is event1. From event1, event9 must happen. So we can take the loop 9 -> 1 -> 9 -> 1 -> ... indefinitely.

This infinite trace contains only events 5, 9, and 1 and never produces event3, event4, or event2. Thus in that possible run:
- event3 does not happen, and
- event4 and event2 do not both happen (in fact neither occurs).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C2 requires both C1 (event6 always happens) and that event5 happens.
- From the context, event5 happens initially, so the second part holds.
- But C1 fails because event6 is not forced on every allowed run. Right after the initial event5, the rules allow either event6 or event7. If we choose event7, the rules permit going back to event5 (after event7, event5 is an allowed next event). From event5 we can again choose event7, and so on.
- Concretely, the infinite sequence 5 → 7 → 5 → 7 → ... is consistent with all given ""after"" rules and never contains event6. Therefore event6 does not always happen.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 holds and event5 happens"") is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is the statement ""if event8 then event9"" (an extra implication).
- With the given rules plus C1, we ask whether event6 is forced to happen.
- From the initial event1 we may choose the allowed successor event4 (rule: after event1 → {4,6,8,9}).
- From event4 we may choose event5 (rule: after event4 → {5,7,8,9}).
- From event5 we may choose event1 (rule: after event5 → {1,3,7}).
- This gives a legal loop 1 → 4 → 5 → 1 → ... that never visits event6 (all transitions respect the given ""either"" choices).
- C1 (event8 → event9) does not force event8 to occur, so it does not break this loop or force event6.
Therefore C2 (""if C1 holds then event6 happens"") is not entailed — it is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1 is: ""If event5 happens, then event8 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 always holds.
- From the context we see the initial condition: event8 happened initially (every run begins with event8).
- Therefore in every possible sequence consistent with the rules, event8 has occurred (at the start). So whenever event5 occurs later in the same sequence, event8 has already happened.
- That makes the implication ""if event5 happens then event8 happens"" true in every allowed run. (Note: although the immediate successors of event5 are {6,7,9} and not 8, the hypothesis does not require event8 to occur immediately after event5.)
- Hence C1 always holds, so C2 is True."

Interpretation: we treat ""eventX happens"" as ""event X eventually occurs"" on a run starting from the initial event3. C2 is true only if every possible run from the initial state eventually contains event2 or event5.

Counterexample (constructive):
- From the initial event3, choose the next events 1 then 4 then 3, and repeat:
  - 3 -> 1 (allowed: after 3, 1 is allowed)
  - 1 -> 4 (allowed: after 1, 4 is allowed)
  - 4 -> 3 (allowed: after 4, 3 is allowed)
- This yields the infinite cycle 3,1,4,3,1,4,... which never visits event2 or event5.

Since there exists a valid run that avoids both event2 and event5 forever, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- We start at event2. From event2 one possible next event is event3 (since 3 ∈ {3,5,6,8,9}).
- From event3 one possible next event is event1 (since 1 ∈ {1,2,7,9}).
- From event1 one possible next event is event2 (since 2 ∈ {2,3}).
- Thus we can loop 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 indefinitely.

This infinite trace never visits event5 and never visits event8. Therefore:
- C1 (""Event5 always happens"") is false (event5 is not inevitable).
- The disjunction C2 (""Event8 happens or C1 holds"") is also false because neither disjunct holds on the demonstrated trace.

Find a counterexample path that never hits event9. From the initial event8:

- 2 -> 1 (allowed)

Now the cycle 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 can repeat indefinitely, and none of those transitions require event9. Thus there is a reachable infinite execution in which event9 never happens. Therefore C1 is false, and so C2 (that C1 always holds) is also false.

</graphml>",0.0,"We want to know whether ""If C1 (event7 eventually happens) holds, then event4 happens"" is true.

1) C1: Event7 eventually happens — this is true because event7 is given as the initial event.

2) From the rules:
- After event7, event9 must happen.
- After event9, one of {event1, event2, event6, event7} happens (choice).
- None of these rules force event4 immediately; event4 is only reachable by choosing event1, event6, event8, or event5 at appropriate times (since after event1 or event6 or event8 or event5 one of the options can be event4).

3) Construct a counterexample path that satisfies C1 but never reaches event4:
Start at initial event7. Then the mandatory next is event9. From event9 always choose event7 again. This yields the infinite loop 7 → 9 → 7 → 9 → … which never contains event4. All transitions along this loop are allowed by the rules.

Because there exists a valid execution where C1 holds but event4 never occurs, the implication ""If C1 then event4"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False"

Reasoning (brief):
- Hypothesis C2 asserts both (C1) event6 never happens and event2 happens.
- From the initial event7, event2 is indeed an allowed next event (7 → 2), so event2 can occur.
- However, the rules also allow event6 after some events (for example 2 → 6, 4 → 6, 5 → 6, etc.), so event6 could occur in other valid continuations.
- Since the context does not force event6 to never occur (C1 is not entailed), the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. Hence C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial event is 6. From event6 the next event must be one of {5, 7, 9}, so C1 (next event = 7) is possible immediately, but not forced.
- C2 asserts that “C1 eventually holds” (i.e., at some point we reach a state whose next event is 7) on all possible evolutions.
- Counterexample run: 6 → 9 → 4. From 9 we may choose 4, and after event4 no further events can happen (terminal). In that run event7 never occurs and there is no future state whose next event is 7.
- Because such a possible execution avoids C1 forever, C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- C1 is the conditional ""if event4 happens then event9 happens."" If event4 never occurs, C1 is vacuously true.
- Start at event8 (given). From event8 we can go to event2. From event2 we can go to event5. From event5 we can go back to event2. Thus the infinite sequence 8 → 2 → 5 → 2 → 5 → ... is allowed by the rules.
- That sequence never contains event4, so C1 holds vacuously, but event4 does not happen. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is not guaranteed.

So C2 is False."

Examine transitions and initial condition:
- Initial event: event4.
- From event4 the allowed next events include event5 (4 -> 5).
- From event5 the allowed next events include event3 (5 -> 3).

Trace showing the event can occur:
- Start at event4 (initial) -> choose event5 -> then choose event3. Thus event3 occurs after two steps.

Conclusion:
- Because there is a reachable sequence from the initial event4 leading to event3, C2 can be satisfied.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.

Reasoning summary:
- From the rules: after event3, event8 is allowed; after event8, event3 is allowed. So starting from the initial event3 we can choose the sequence 3 → 8 → 3 → 8 → ... indefinitely.
- This infinite run contains event8 but never contains event6 (we always choose the 3 successor of 8 and avoid the 6 successor of 3).
- Therefore it is not true that every occurrence of event8 forces event6 to happen, so C1 is false; hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

From the context, the initial event is event1. The rule for event1 says: after event1, the next event must be either event7 or event8. Therefore the immediate next state can only be event7 or event8.

C1 asserts that event2 and event6 both happen in that next state. But the next state cannot be event2 or event6 (it must be 7 or 8), and only one event occurs in a state. Thus C1 cannot hold in the next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event8 or event4"". C2 is ""event8 or C1"", which is logically equivalent to ""event8 or event4"" (so C2 = C1).
- We need to check whether from the initial event6, event8 or event4 must inevitably occur. If there is any allowed path that never reaches 4 or 8, C2 is not guaranteed.
- From the given transitions we can follow this valid infinite cycle that avoids 4 and 8:
  6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 7 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> ...
  Each step is allowed by the rules (e.g. 6→2, 2→1, 1→7, 7→3, 3→6, 6→5, 5→7, etc.), and no event4 or event8 appears.
- Because such a path exists where neither 4 nor 8 ever happens, C2 is not entailed by the context.

Therefore C2 is False."

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: event7 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds and event4 happens (i.e., event7 never occurs and event4 occurs).
We must decide whether C2 can be true given the rules.

Step 2 — relevant rules (condensed)
- Start: event6 happened.
- After 6 → either 4 or 5.
- After 4 → 9.
- After 9 → either 4, 6, or 7.
- Other rules exist (transitions from 5,1,2,3,7,8), but they don't force anything if we avoid those events.

Step 3 — construct a sequence that satisfies all obligations and avoids event7 while including event4
- From initial 6 choose 4 (allowed): sequence begins 6 → 4.
- After 4, 9 must happen: 6 → 4 → 9.
- After 9 choose 4 (allowed): 6 → 4 → 9 → 4.
- Repeat 9 → 4 → 9 ... indefinitely.

This infinite cycle (4 ↔ 9) satisfies every ""after"" requirement for the events that actually occur, never requires event7, and includes event4.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a valid sequence starting from the initial conditions in which event4 occurs and event7 never occurs, C2 can be true.

Final answer:
True"

Reasoning summary:
- C1 says ""event4 eventually happens."" C2 is its negation.
- From the start event8 you can immediately go to event4 (8 -> 4), so there are runs where event4 does occur (so C2 is not universally true).
- But you can also avoid event4 forever: choose 8 -> 1, then 1 -> 3 (forced), then 3 -> 1, repeating the 1–3 cycle forever. That run never includes event4.
- Therefore neither C1 nor C2 is entailed by the rules, and in particular C2 is not true."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step the event is event2). That already fails initially because the initial event is event9, not event2.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. after the initial step, from that next state onward event2 would have to always happen.
- From the initial event9 the next event could be event7 (since after event9 one of {3,4,7} must happen). From event7 a next event of event1 is allowed (event7 -> {1,2,5}).
- Thus there is a possible next state (9 -> 7) where the very next event need not be 2 (it can be 1). Therefore C1 does not hold in that next state, so C2 is false."

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 happens, so C1 (""event8 or event3 happens"") is true.
- But C2 requires that event9 happens as well. From event8 the allowed next events are {2,5,9}, so event9 is possible but not forced.
- There is a cycle avoiding event9: 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 5 -> 2 ... which never visits 9. Since a valid sequence exists where event9 never occurs, event9 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 (""event9 happens and C1 holds"") is not entailed."

</graphml>",0.0,"Goal: determine whether C2 (""C1 always holds""), where C1 = ""Event7 does not happen"", is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret hypothesis:
- C2 asserts that in every possible sequence of events (given the rules and the initial event), event7 never occurs.

Step 2 — extract transition rules (unique edges) and start:
- Start: event6 has happened.
- Transitions:
  - 1 -> {2,3,4,5,8}
  - 2 -> {1,4,5,6,9}
  - 3 -> {2,4,5,7,9}
  - 4 -> {2,8}
  - 5 -> {1,2,4,7,9}
  - 6 -> {2,3,4,5,9}
  - 7 -> {2,4,8,9}
  - 8 -> {4,5,6,9}
  - 9 -> {1,2,3,5}

Step 3 — check reachability of event7 from the start (event6):
- From event6 we can go to event3 (6 -> 3 is allowed).
- From event3 we can go to event7 (3 -> 7 is allowed).
- Therefore a valid sequence is 6 → 3 → 7, so event7 can occur.

Conclusion:
- Since there exists a possible sequence in which event7 happens, C1 (""Event7 does not happen"") is not always true. Hence C2 is False.

- After event5, allowed next events are {event2, event7, event9}.
- After event2, allowed next events are {event1, event3, event4, event5, event6, event8}.
- After event1, allowed next events are {event3, event4, event6, event7, event9}.
- After event3, allowed next events are {event1, event2, event5, event6, event7, event9}.
- (Other rules are present but these suffice.)

Step 3 — construct a legal sequence starting from event4 that avoids event9
- Choose 4 -> 5 (allowed).
- Then 5 -> 2 (allowed).
- Then 2 -> 1 (allowed).
- Then 1 -> 3 (allowed).
- Then 3 -> 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 <-> 3 indefinitely. None of these chosen transitions requires event9; each step has options that avoid event9. Therefore there is a legal execution in which event4 occurs but event9 never occurs.

Conclusion
- C1 is false (it is not guaranteed that event9 happens after event4).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event8 happened. The given rule for after event8 states the next event must be one of {event2, event5, event7, event9}.
- C1 asserts that event2 happens next. That is one allowed possibility but is not forced by the rules (event5, event7, or event9 could equally occur).
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 does not happen next). That too is not forced by the rules because event2 could happen.
- Since neither ""event2 must happen"" nor ""event2 must not happen"" is entailed, C2 (which claims event2 does not happen) is not necessarily true.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true because event2 happened initially.
- C2 claims that whenever event2 happens then event9 must happen. To refute this we need a possible infinite sequence starting from event2 that never visits event9.
- The context allows the following transitions: 2 -> 1, 1 -> 4, 4 -> 6, 6 -> 1. This yields the cycle 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> ... which never includes event9 and is permitted by the given rules.
- Because there exists a valid path from event2 that avoids event9 indefinitely, event9 is not guaranteed when C1 holds. Therefore the implication in C2 does not hold.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened. From the rule ""After event4, either event5, or event9 must happen,"" the next state can be event5 or event9.
- C1 asserts event9 happens next; that is possible but not guaranteed.
- C2 asserts C1 does not hold (i.e., event9 does not happen next). Because the next state could be event9, we cannot conclude that C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises — answer: False."

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- Start: event4 happened.
- Relevant transitions (consolidated):
  - 4 -> {2,6,7}
  - 7 -> {6,9}
  - 6 -> {2,3,4,5,7,9}
  - 3 -> {1,2,4,5,9}
  - 1 -> {3,5}
  - 2 -> {4,7,8,9}
  - 9 -> {1,5,7,8}
  - 5 -> {2,3,7,9}
  - 8 -> {2,3,4,7}

- To show C1 (""Event8 always happens"") is false it suffices to find a possible infinite sequence that never produces event8. One such sequence:
  4 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...
  This stays in the cycle 1↔3 (via 1->3 and 3->1), and none of the events in this cycle force event8. All choices along the path avoided the transitions to 2 or 9 that could lead to 8. Hence event8 is not guaranteed to occur.

- Because C1 is false, C2 (which asserts C1 holds and event2 happens) is also false, regardless of whether event2 can occur in some runs.

Therefore C2 is False."

- 2 -> {4, 7, 8, 9}

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 says: event9 happens and event4 happens. Since event4 is given to have happened initially, C1 reduces to “event9 happens.”
- C2 says: event8 happens OR C1 holds — equivalently, from the initial state this is “event8 happens OR event9 happens.”

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (graph view)
- Transitions:
  1 -> {3,6,9}
  2 -> {1,3,4,7}
  3 -> {2,4,6,8,9}
  4 -> {1,3,5,6,8}  (initial node)
  5 -> {1,2,3,7}
  6 -> {5,8,9}
  7 -> {1,5,6,9}
  8 -> {6,9}
  9 -> {2,3,4,7}

Step 3 — find a counterexample path where neither 8 nor 9 ever occurs
- From 4 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 3 (allowed, avoids 9).
- From 3 choose 2 (allowed, avoids 8 and 9).
- From 2 choose 1 (allowed, avoids 8 and 9).
- This yields the cycle 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 repeating forever. That infinite path never visits 8 or 9.

Conclusion
- Because there exists a valid sequence starting from the initial event4 that never reaches event8 or event9, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- We start with event5 having happened (given).
- After event5 the allowed immediate next events are {event2, event3, event4, event8}.
- C1 requires both event9 and event3 to have happened. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., immediately after the next transition).
- From event5 it is possible for event3 to happen next, but event9 is not one of the immediate choices after event5. Event9 can occur only after other events (for example, after event3 you can get event9, but that would be the step after the next).
- Therefore it is impossible for both event9 and event3 to have happened in the very next state after the initial event5.

Thus C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- C1 states ""Event7 eventually happens"" — i.e., at some point event7 occurs.
- C2 states ""If C1 holds, then event7 happens."" That is just the implication: if event7 eventually happens, then event7 happens.
- This is tautologically true: the antecedent asserts exactly that event7 occurs at some time, so the consequent (event7 happens) follows directly.

- C1: ""Event7 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — i.e., ""event7 occurs at some point OR event2 occurs at some point.""
We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed (True) given the transition rules starting from event4.

Step 2 — examine transitions
From the context we have these relevant transitions (condensed):
- 4 -> 1,2,3,6
- 1 -> 5,7
- 5 -> 7,9
- 9 -> 1,5,7,8
(and others, but these are enough)

Step 3 — find a path that avoids both event2 and event7
Starting at 4, choose transitions that avoid 2 and 7:
- 4 -> 1 (allowed)
- 1 -> 5 (choose 5 to avoid 7)
- 5 -> 9 (choose 9 to avoid 7)
- 9 -> 1 (choose 1 to avoid 7)
Now we are back at 1 and can repeat 1->5->9->1 indefinitely. This infinite cycle (4,1,5,9,1,5,9,...) never includes event2 or event7, and every step follows an allowed ""after eventX"" choice.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (there exists a valid sequence where neither event2 nor event7 ever occurs).

False"

Reasoning (sketch):
- C2 is ""if event3 happens then (event5 and event3) holds"", which essentially requires that event3 implies event5 (event3 implies event3 is trivial).
- From the rules, after event3 one possible next event is event1 (3 -> 1).
- From event1 one possible next event is event7 (1 -> 7), and from event7 one possible next event is event1 (7 -> 1). Thus we can cycle 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 1 -> 7 ... forever without ever taking event5.
- Therefore event3 can occur without event5 ever occurring, so the implication (event3 -> event5) is not forced. Hence C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened. From event4 the next state must be either event7 or event8.
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreting that as: at the state reached after the initial step, C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") must be true. That means from that intermediate state, event1 must be a possible next event.
- If the next state is event7, then event1 is indeed one of the allowed successors of event7, so C1 would hold there.
- But if the next state is event8, the allowed successors are event6 or event9 (no event1), so C1 would not hold there.
- Because a next-state of event8 is permitted, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Therefore C2 is False."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event8 always happens."" (i.e., event 8 must occur in every possible run)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" So we must decide whether C1 is true (in all possible evolutions from the initial state).

Step 2 — summarize transition rules (non-deterministic choices)
- 1 -> {3, 6, 8}
- 2 -> {1, 4, 8}
- 3 -> {1, 5, 6, 8}
- 4 -> {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- 5 -> {1, 9}
- 6 -> {2, 3, 7, 9}
- 7 -> {3, 4}
- 8 -> {2, 3, 9}
- 9 -> {1, 5, 6}
Initial event: 9.

Step 3 — find a run that avoids event8
- From 9 we can pick 5 (since 9 -> 5).
- From 5 we can pick 9 (since 5 -> 9).
- That yields the cycle 9 -> 5 -> 9 -> 5 -> ... which never visits event8.

Because there exists a valid infinite run starting from the initial event that never hits event8, C1 (""Event8 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

From the rules:
- After event3 one may choose 1, 4, 5, or 6.
- After event5 one may choose 3 or 8.
- After event3 one may again choose 5, etc.

Counterexample (a valid infinite trace that avoids C2):
- Start at event3 (given).
- Choose event5 next (allowed: after 3 → 5).
- From event5 choose event3 (allowed: after 5 → 3).
- Repeat 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... forever.

In that trace no event9 ever occurs, and neither event1 nor event7 ever occurs, so C1 is false and event9 is false. Because there exists a valid sequence that falsifies C2, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event2 occurs. From event2 the allowed next events include event1 (as well as event3, event5, event6, event8).
- If we choose event1, from event1 the allowed next events include event2 (as well as event3, event5).
- Thus we can cycle event2 → event1 → event2 → ... indefinitely without ever producing event4, event6, or event7.
- Therefore ""event4 or event6"" (C1) is not guaranteed, and in particular ""C1 and event7"" (C2) is not guaranteed.

</graphml>",1.0,"We're asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 is ""If event6 happens, then event8 happens"" (i.e. whenever event6 occurs, event8 must inevitably occur later). So we need to check whether every possible continuation after event6 eventually leads to event8; if not, C1 fails and C2 is true.

From the rules:
- After event6 the next event can be 3, 7, or 9.
- After event3 the next event can be 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.
- After event6 again can be 3, 7, or 9.

Hence there is a valid cycle 6 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3 -> ... that never visits event1 or event5 (the only events that lead to event8). Since that infinite continuation never reaches event8, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

</graphml>",0.0,"We ask whether ""Event7 happens and Event5 eventually happens"" is entailed by the given rules starting from initial event8.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Start at event8 (given).
- From 8 one allowed next event is 9.
- From 9 one allowed next event is 5.
- From 5 one allowed next event is 9.

So there is a valid infinite path 8 → 9 → 5 → 9 → 5 → ... that repeats 9 and 5 forever. On this path event5 does occur (so C1 holds), but event7 never occurs. Because a path exists that satisfies the rules yet never includes event7, the conjunction ""event7 happens and event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer: False"
