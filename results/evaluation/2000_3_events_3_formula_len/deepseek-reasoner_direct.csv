From the rules, after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. However, it is possible to have sequences where event1 never occurs (e.g., event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ...) or event2 never occurs (e.g., event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ...). In such sequences, C1 never holds because either event1 or event2 is missing. Therefore, C2 does not hold for all sequences, meaning C2 is false. Thus, C3 is true.

C1 states that event2 happens in the next state. However, from the constraints, when the current state is event2, the next state must be event1, so event2 does not happen in the next state.

C2 claims that C1 always holds, but since C1 does not hold in states where event2 or event3 is the current event, C2 is false.

- C3 states that C2 eventually holds. Since C2 is always true, it certainly eventually holds.

- The context states that event2 happened initially, and after event2, no other events can happen. Therefore, event3 never occurs.
- C1 asserts that event3 eventually happens, which is false in this context.
- C2 states that if C1 holds, then event3 happens. Since C1 is false, the implication ""if C1 then event3"" is logically true (a false premise implies any conclusion). Thus, C2 is always true.
- C3 asserts that C2 eventually holds. Since C2 is always true, it holds at all times, including eventually. Therefore, C3 is true.

- The context states that initially, event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, no other events can happen. Similarly, after event3, no other events can happen.
- C1 claims that event2 happens in the next state. However, from the initial state (where event2 has already happened), the next state must involve event1, not event2. Thus, C1 is false from the initial state.
- C2 claims that C1 always holds. Since C1 is false from the initial state, C2 cannot hold.

- C1 states: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology, meaning it is always true regardless of whether event1 occurs or not. In logical terms, an implication with a false antecedent is true, and if the antecedent is true, the consequent is true, so C1 holds in every state.

- C2 states: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is always true in every state, it must also be true in the next state. Therefore, C2 is always true.

- C3 states: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is always true, C3 is true.

The context provided about events (event3 happening initially, and the rules after event1, event2, and event3) does not affect the truth of C1, C2, or C3 because C1 is a tautology and remains true under any sequence of events. Thus, C3 is True.

From this, event2 must occur after event3 because if event1 occurs after event3, event2 must follow event1, and if event2 occurs after event3, event2 happens directly. Thus, event2 always happens in the sequence, meaning C1 is true.

C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 happens, C2 is true. Even if C1 were false, the implication would still hold true, so C2 is always true.

- The context states that event1 happened initially. Therefore, ""event1 happens"" is always true in any sequence of events.
- C1 is defined as ""event1 happens or event2 happens"". Since event1 always happens, C1 is always true.
- C2 is defined as ""C1 holds or event3 happens"". Since C1 is always true, C2 is always true regardless of whether event3 happens.
- C3 is defined as ""C2 holds or event3 happens"". Since C2 is always true, C3 is always true.

Thus, C3 holds true in all possible scenarios under the given context.

Thus, event1, event2, and event3 all occur.

Now, evaluating the hypotheses:

- C2: Event3 happens and C1 holds. Since event3 happens and C1 is true, C2 is true.

- C1 states that event3 always happens. In this sequence, event3 does happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 states that event2 happens or C1 holds. Since event2 happens, C2 is true regardless of C1.
- C3 states that C2 always holds. Since C2 is true in the only possible sequence, C2 always holds, making C3 true.

Thus, C3 is True.

- The context states that event3 happened initially, and the rules ensure that event3 continues to occur in all possible sequences (either directly after event1 or after event2). Therefore, event3 always happens, meaning C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is always false.

- C2 is a conditional statement: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" Since C1 is always false, the implication ""false implies anything"" is always true. Thus, C2 is always true.

However, from the initial condition, event3 occurs in state 0. If C3 holds, then in state 0, event3 occurs and event1 occurs in state 1. Similarly, for state 1, C2 must hold, meaning event3 occurs in state 1 and event1 occurs in state 2. This implies that both event1 and event3 occur in state 1, which is impossible since only one event can occur per state.

Additionally, from the rules, after event1, event2 must occur. If event1 occurs in state 1, then event2 must occur in state 2. But from C3, event1 occurs in state 2, leading to a contradiction.

Therefore, C3 cannot be true, and it is false.

- C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology and always true.
- C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is also always true, regardless of whether event2 happens.
- C3 states: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C2 is always true, C3 effectively requires that event1 must always happen.

However, from the context:
- Event3 happened initially, and after event3, no other events can happen.
- Event1 may or may not have happened before event3, as there is no requirement that event1 must happen if event2 did not happen.
- Since event3 occurred initially and no events can happen after, event1 might not have occurred at all.

Therefore, event1 does not necessarily happen, so C3 is false.

- The context states that initially event1 happened, and after event1, event2 must happen. Therefore, event2 must occur at least once in any sequence starting from event1.
- C1 claims that event1 always happens, but since event2 must occur after event1, event1 cannot always happen (as event2 occurs at some point). Thus, C1 is false.
- C2 states that event2 happens or C1 holds. Since event2 must happen (as derived from the initial event1 and the rule after event1), C2 is true regardless of C1 being false.
- C3 states that C2 holds or event3 happens. Since C2 is true, C3 is true irrespective of whether event3 occurs.

C1 states ""Event1 always happens,"" which means event1 occurs at every point in time or infinitely often. However, in the sequence, event1 occurs only once at the end, and before that, event1 has not occurred. Therefore, C1 is false.
