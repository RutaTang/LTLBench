1. From the context: initial state t0 has event3 true. The transition rules force the next events: after event3 → event1; after event1 → event2; after event2 → event1. So the state sequence is t0: event3, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ... (alternating event1 and event2 after the initial event3).

2. C1 is (event1 or event2) — true in any state where event1 or event2 holds.

3. C2 is (C1 holds AND event1). That simplifies to just event1 (because event1 implies C1, so the conjunction is equivalent to event1).

4. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., ""event1 holds in the next state.""

3. Consider any state:

1. From the context the transition rules force this unique trace:

   - t2: event3 (after event1, event3 must happen)

3. C2 = C1 OR event3. Since C1 is always false, C2 is equivalent to event3 (true exactly in the event3 states).

4. C3 = (If event1 happens, then C2 holds). Interpreting this as a state implication: whenever event1 is true in a state, C2 must also be true in that same state. But in the trace above, at t1 we have event1 true while event3 (hence C2) is false. So the implication fails at that state.

4. At the initial state event2 holds. The next state must be event3.

1. Start: initially event1 happened.
2. From event1, the rules force either event2 or event3 to happen next.
3. If event2 happens next, then event2 has occurred (so C1: ""event2 eventually happens"" is true).
4. If event3 happens next, the rules require event2 to happen after event3, so event2 will occur on the following step (so C1 is true in this branch as well).
5. Therefore in every possible run event2 occurs (within at most two steps), so C1 is true.
6. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — hence C2 is false.
7. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"", i.e. not(C1 does not hold), which is equivalent to C1. Since C1 is true, C3 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context transitions: 1 -> {2 or 3}, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1. Initial state is event1.
2. C1 = (event2 or event3). So C1 is true exactly in states 2 or 3, false in state 1.
3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"". 
   - If currently in state 2 or 3, C1 already holds, so C2 holds immediately.
   - If currently in state 1, the next state must be 2 or 3, so C1 holds in the next state; therefore C2 holds at state 1 as well.

1. From the context:
   - Initially event1.
   - After event1, event3 must happen.
   - After event3, event1 must happen.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (but nothing leads to event2 here).

1. C1 and C2 are the same statement: ""Event1 eventually happens."" So C3 = ""C1 or C2"" is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens.""

2. Start at the initial state: event2.

3. From event2, the rules require that the next state is either event1 or event3.

4. If the next state is event1, then event1 has occurred immediately — so ""event1 eventually happens"" is true.

5. If the next state is event3, the rules require that after event3, event1 must happen. So event1 occurs on the following step.

6. In both possible choices starting from event2, event1 occurs within one or two steps. There is no possible run that avoids event1 forever.

2. C1 = (event1 and event2). Since at most one event can hold in a state and event1 and event2 never occur, C1 is false in every state.

8. Start: event3 → then must go to event2 → then remain at event2 forever.
9. Event1 never occurs at any point in this execution, so C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false (already false at the initial state and at all states).

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., from the current state there is some future state with event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = ""always (event1 eventually happens)"" (i.e., from every state along the run, event1 will occur at some future time).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = ""always (always (event1 eventually happens))"". This is equivalent to C2 (nesting the same always/eventually property doesn't change it).

Step 2 — model the allowed transitions (given the context):
- From event1 → next is either event2 or event3.
- From event2 → next is event1 (forced).
- From event3 → next is either event1 or event2.
Initial state: event3.

Step 3 — show event1 is inevitable from any reachable state:
- From event2: next state is event1 (so event1 occurs immediately).
- From event3: either go to event1 immediately, or go to event2 and then to event1 on the following step. So event1 occurs within at most two steps.
- From event1: if next is event2, then event1 occurs the step after that (2→1). If next is event3, then as just argued event1 will occur within two further steps. So from event1, event1 will reoccur within at most two steps.

Thus from every reachable state there is a finite future leading to event1 — i.e. ""always eventually event1"" (C2) holds. Consequently C3 (which is equivalent) also holds.

1. C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"" — this is true in states where event3 (or event2) happens, and false in states where event1 happens.
2. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — from a given state, there is some future state where event1 does not happen.
3. System transitions: initially event1. From event1 → event3 must happen. From event3 → event1 must happen. (After event2 → event3 is irrelevant because event2 never occurs starting from the given initial state.)
4. Therefore the system alternates: event1, event3, event1, event3, ... So every event1 state is immediately followed by a state where event3 holds (i.e., event1 does not happen).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""event1 and event2"" (both true in the same state). As in the given setup, a single state records which event happened and only one event can hold at a time, so no state can have both event1 and event2 true simultaneously. Therefore C1 is never true in any state.

2. C2 is the implication ""if C1 holds then event3 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so since C1 is always false, C2 is true in every state (including the initial state).

3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is satisfied.

Thus C3 is True."

1. Restate the formulas:
   - C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens (event1 → event2).
   - C2: event3 happens OR C1 holds (event3 ∨ (event1 → event2)).
   - C3: C2 always holds (C2 holds in every reachable state).

2. Examine the context (transition rules):
   - Initially event2 happened (initial state = event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (transitions from event3 to event1 or event2).

3. Determine reachable states from the initial state:
   - The initial state is event2.
   - Since after event2 no other events can happen, there are no successor states. The only reachable state is the initial state (event2).

4. Evaluate C2 in the reachable state(s):
   - In the event2 state: event3 is false, so the left disjunct is false.
   - Check (event1 → event2): the antecedent event1 is false in this state, so the implication is true. Thus C1 holds in this state.
   - Therefore C2 (event3 ∨ (event1 → event2)) is true in the initial state.

5. Since C2 is true in the only reachable state, C2 holds in all states along every path. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

1. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (globally).
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ¬(Event1 always happens). Equivalently, C2 means ""there exists some state (now or in the future) where Event1 is false"".
3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — there is a future state from which C1 is false (or simply: eventually there is a state satisfying C2).

Now use the context:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, the next state must be event2 or event3.
- In states event2 or event3, Event1 is false.
Thus right after the initial state there is a state where Event1 does not hold, so C1 is false already at the initial state. Therefore C2 holds at the initial state (C1 does not hold). Since C2 holds now, C2 certainly holds at some future point, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

Reasoning:
- From the context: initial state = event1. After event1, event3 must happen. So the next state is event3.
- C1 = ""event2 eventually happens"" (a future/eventuality property).
- C2 = ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" At a state this requires event2 to be true now (together with the eventuality, which would be trivially true if event2 is true now). Thus C2 effectively requires the current state to be event2.
- C3 = ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds."" That requires any state with event3 to also be a state where event2 holds simultaneously.
- But at the state reached after the initial event1 we have event3 (and not event2). Therefore the antecedent of C3 is true while the consequent (C2: event2 now) is false, so the implication fails.

Thus C3 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event3 is true.
2. From the context: after event3, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen — so the trace is event3, then event1 forever (event1 becomes a terminal state).
3. C1 is the state formula (event3 → event2). That is false in any state where event3 is true and event2 is false; otherwise it is true (vacuously when event3 is false).
4. At the initial state (event3), C1 is false (event2 is not true there). At the subsequent state (event1) and all later states, event3 is false, so C1 holds in every of those states.
5. C2 is “C1 always holds” (i.e., from that state onward C1 is true at every step). Although C2 is false at the initial state, it becomes true at the event1 state and remains true thereafter.
6. Therefore C3 (“C2 eventually holds”) is true because there exists a future state (the event1 state) from which C2 holds forever.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (a property of the current state about its successor).
2. C2 = ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" = (C1 -> event3_at_current_state).
3. C3 = ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds"" = (event3_at_current_state -> C2).

Two observations show C3 always holds:

A. If event3 is false at a state, then event3 -> C2 is vacuously true at that state.

B. If event3 is true at a state, then the consequent of C2 (""event3 happens"") is true at that state, so C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds. Thus event3 -> C2 is true at that state as well.

Therefore in every state C3 holds, so C3 is True."

3. C2 is the implication ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Evaluate C2 in states:
   - In states where event3 holds (the event3 states), the antecedent is true but C1 is false, so C2 is false in those states.

   - So event2 may or may not ever occur, but if it does it occurs in some state; otherwise it never occurs.

2. Evaluate C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
   - This is a propositional implication p -> p, which is a tautology (always true) in any state where p is either true or false. So C1 holds in every state.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 always holds.""
   - Since C1 is true in every state, the statement ""always C1"" is true at every state. Thus C2 holds.

1. C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., event1 is false in the considered state).
2. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, event1 does not happen; equivalently, event1 never happens).
3. C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not true that event1 never happens — equivalently, event1 happens at some point).

Now use the context:
4. Initially event3 happened.
5. The rules include: ""After event3, event1 must happen.""
6. Therefore at the next state after the initial one, event1 happens.
7. Because event1 does occur (at that next state), C1 is false at that state, so C2 (""event1 never happens"") is false.

- C3 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide if this is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context (transition rules + initial)
- Initial state: event3.
- Transitions required:
  - After event3, event2 must happen (3 -> 2).
  - After event2, event3 must happen (2 -> 3).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (1 -> 2).
- No rule allows a transition from 2 or 3 to 1, and the initial state is 3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Starting at 3, next must be 2; from 2 next must be 3; from 3 next must be 2, etc.
- The system therefore alternates 3,2,3,2,... forever.
- Event1 can never occur in any state because no allowed transition leads to event1.

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true (event1 never occurs).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true (event1 never occurs at any time).
- C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds""): since event1 never happens, the implication holds (and indeed its consequent C2 is true anyway).

3. After event1, event3 must happen. So s2 = event3.
4. C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state."" Evaluate C1 at s1: the next state of s1 is s2 = event3, so C1 is false at s1.
5. C2 = ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true at s1 (since C1 is false there).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Simplify the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to simply event2.
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" becomes (event2 -> event3).
   - C3: ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds"" becomes (event3 -> (event2 -> event3)).

2. Evaluate C3 in any state where event3 holds:
   - If event3 is true in a state, then (event2 -> event3) is true in that state because the consequent (event3) is true. (An implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent.)
   - Thus whenever event3 holds, C2 holds.

3. Therefore C3 is true in all reachable states (including the initial state where event3 holds).

1. C1 = ""Event3 always happens."" This requires every state on a trace to be event3.

2. C2 = ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""  
   - An implication ""If A then B"" is false exactly when A is true and B is false.  
   - On any trace where event1 happens, the antecedent is true, but from (1) C1 is false (because the trace contains a non-event3 state). So C2 is false on any trace that contains event1.

3. C3 = ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds.""

1. Goal: decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

2. Unpack the formulas:
   - C1: Event1 eventually happens.
   - C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state, Event1 eventually happens).
   - C3: C2 always holds (C2 is true in every state along the run).

3. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen — by the same interpretation used in the examples, the system remains at event1 thereafter (a self-loop on event1).
   - Thus the trace is event1 at every state (initial and all future states).

4. Evaluate C1, C2, C3 on that trace:
   - C1 holds immediately (event1 is true now) and in every future state (event1 continues to hold), so C1 is true at every state.
   - Therefore, at any state, in the next state C1 also holds (the next state is event1 and so event1 eventually happens there). So C2 is true at every state.
   - Since C2 is true at every state, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Context summary:
- Initially event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the immediate next state is event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once at event2 it stays at event2 forever).
- After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event3 never appears).

Hypothesis parts:
- C1: Event3 does not happen (i.e., event3 never occurs).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state.
- C3: Event2 happens or C2 holds.

Reasoning:
1. From the context, the run is: initial state event1, next state event2, and then event2 forever (because after event1 you must go to event2, and after event2 no other events can happen).
2. Therefore event3 never occurs in this run. So C1 is true.
3. The next state (the state after the initial one) is event2 and, in that state's future, event3 still never occurs (it stays event2). So C1 holds in the next state; hence C2 is true at the initial state.
4. C3 is ""event2 happens or C2 holds"". C2 holds, so C3 is true (also event2 does occur in the next state).

Context (transitions):
- Initial state: event2.
- event1 -> next must be event2.
- event2 -> next must be event1 or event3.
- event3 -> next must be event2.

Interpret C1/C2/C3 as state formulas with a next operator:
- C1 = (next event3).
- C2 = (event3) AND (next event3).
- C3 = (event2) OR C2.

Evaluate at the initial state (which is event2):
- event2 is true in the initial state.

4. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" Evaluate C2 at s1: C1 at s1 asks whether event1 holds in s2; s2 is event3, so that C1 (at s1) is false, hence C2 is true at s1.

1. From the context:
   - Initially event1 holds.
   - After event1, no other events can happen — so the next state after initial is again event1 (self-loop forever).
   - Transitions involving event2 or event3 never occur starting from the initial state.

2. Evaluate C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is the tautological implication event3 → event3, which is true in every state.

3. Evaluate C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is the implication event3 → True, which is also true in every state (an implication with a true consequent is always true).

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state from the initial state is event1, and as just shown C2 is true in every state, so C2 holds in that next state.

- C2: (if C1 holds, then event1 happens) — i.e. C1 -> event1 (evaluated in the current state).
- C3: C2 always holds (C2 holds in every state along the run).

Step 2 — use the context to determine possible runs:
- Initially event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen → the next state is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen → from event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
- The clause ""after event3, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event3 never occurs in any allowed run.

Thus the only possible behavior is: event1 (initial) → event2 → event2 → event2 → ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3 on that behavior:
- C1 (event3 eventually happens) is false (event3 never occurs).
- C2 is the implication (C1 -> event1). Since C1 is false, the implication is true (vacuously) in every state.
- Therefore C2 holds in every state, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Context summary:
- s0 (initial): event2.
- From event1 → next must be event2.
- From event2 → next is either event1 or event3.
- From event3 → next must be event2.

Hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every state from the current point).
- C2: ¬C1 (C1 does not hold).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.

1. Could C1 ever be true at any state? C1 requires that every state have event1. That is impossible:
   - If the current state is event1, the transition rule forces the next state to be event2 (not event1), so event1 cannot hold at every future state.
   - If the current state is not event1, then C1 is already false immediately.
   So C1 is false in every state.

2. Therefore C2 (¬C1) is true in every state.

3. In particular, from the initial state s0, every immediate successor state (either event1 or event3) satisfies C2. Thus ""C2 holds in the next state"" is true.

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" True at the initial state because state1 is event3 (so event3 happens immediately next).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" Interpreted as the state formula (C1 → event3) evaluated at a given state. At the initial state C1 is true, but event3 is not true there (initial state has event1), so C2 is false at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must check C2 at state1 (the next state). At state1:
  - C1 is true (event3 already holds at state1, so ""event3 eventually happens"" is true),
  - event3 is true at state1,
  - therefore (C1 → event3) is true at state1, so C2 holds at the next state.

Thus C3 is true (C2 does hold in the next state).

Context summary and trace:
- Initial state: event1 is true.
- From event1 the next state must be event2.
- From event2 no other events can happen → once at event2, all future states are event2.
- Event3 never gets triggered in this trace.

state0: event1
state1: event2
state2: event2
state3: event2

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""in every state (from the start) event2 holds"" — this is false because state0 has event1, not event2.

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 (which requires C1 to hold at every state) is also false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (X Event1).  
2. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (globally, every state has its successor be Event1).  
3. Starting state: Event2. From Event2 the next state must be Event1 or Event3. To make C2 true, the next state from Event2 would have to be Event1.  
4. But at a state Event1, the allowed next events are Event2 or Event3 (not Event1), so C1 would fail at that Event1 state. Hence C1 cannot hold at every state if the run ever visits Event1.  
5. If from Event2 the next state is Event3, then by the rules Event3's next must be Event2 (not Event1), so C1 fails at that Event3 state as well.  
6. Therefore there is no possible infinite run in which every state's successor is Event1; C2 cannot hold.  
7. C3 asserts that C2 does not hold; since C2 is impossible, C3 is True."

1. Simplify the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" simplifies to C1 = event3.
   - C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is C2 = (event2 → event3).
   - C3: ""C2 holds or event3 happens"" is C3 = (event2 → event3) OR event3.

2. Use the context:
   - Initially event1 happens. So in the initial state: event1 = true, event2 = false, event3 = false.
   - From event1 only event1 can happen (self-loop), so the system stays at event1; thus event2 never holds in any reachable state and event3 never holds in any reachable state either.

3. Evaluate C2 at the initial state:
   - event2 is false, so the implication (event2 → event3) is true (false → anything = true).
   - Therefore C2 holds at the initial state.

4. Evaluate C3 at the initial state:
   - C3 = C2 OR event3. Since C2 is true at the initial state, C3 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"" — that's a tautology (always true).
2. C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"". Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to ""event3 happens"".

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The context states the initial state has event1 happened (initially event1 = true).

Context / transition rules:
- Initially event1.
- From event1, event3 must happen next.
- From event3, event1 must happen next.
- From event2, next is either event1 or event3.
(So starting from event1 the system alternates event1 ⇄ event3 forever; event2 never occurs.)

Hypothesis formulas (interpreted as state formulas):
- C1: (event1 → event2) — an implication in the same state.
- C2: event1 OR C1.
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.

2. Therefore C2 at the initial state = event1 OR C1 = true OR false = true.
3. The next state after the initial event1 must be event3.
4. In an event3 state: event1 is false. C1 (event1 → event2) is true there (implication with false antecedent is true).

1. C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" (globally).

- Timeline from the rules: state0 = event2, state1 = event3, state2 = event1, state3 = event3, state4 = event1, ... (then alternates event3, event1).
- C1 is (event2 → event1). That is false only in a state where event2 is true and event1 is false. That happens only at state0. C1 is true at every state from state1 onward (because event2 is false there).
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1). For every state i ≥ 0, the next state i+1 is one of state1, state2, ... where C1 is true. So C2 holds at every state.

   So the run is: state0: event1, state1: event3, state2: event2, state3: event3, state4: event2, ...

   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (C2 is true at state1).

4. Therefore C2 is true at state0 (C1 does not hold).

5. Check C2 at the next state (state1): from state1 the future contains state2 where event2 (not event3) holds, so event3 is not true in every future state from state1. Thus C1 is false at state1, so C2 is true at state1.

   - ""C1 does not hold"" means the negation of C1 in that state.

Context transitions:
- Initially: event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → the next state from the initial state is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is terminal (it can only stay at event2).
- After event3, event1 must happen → event3 → event1 cycle possible, but irrelevant here because we never can reach event3 from the initial state.

Evaluate the formulas (state formula semantics: C1 holds in a state iff (not event1) or event3 holds in that state):
1. C1 = (event1 → event3) ≡ (not event1) or event3.
2. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state.""
   - From the initial state (event1), the next state is event2.
   - In the event2 state: event1 is false, event3 is false, so C1 = (not event1) or event3 = true (because not event1 is true).
   - Therefore C2 is true at the initial state.
3. C3 = event1 or C2.
   - In the initial state event1 is true, and we also found C2 true, so C3 is true.

1. From the context the system evolves as: initially event3. After event3 → event1. After event1 → event2. After event2 → event1. So the trace is: state0: event3, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, state4: event2, ... (event1 and event2 alternate after the initial event3). At any single state exactly one event holds.

2. C1: ""Event3 and event2"" — this requires event3 and event2 to hold simultaneously in one state. That never happens (event3 only at initial state, event2 at later states, and events are mutually exclusive). So C1 is false in all states.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is true.

1. From the context, the system's timeline is:
   - State 0: event2 (initially).
   - State 1: event3 (after event2, event3 must happen).
   - State 2: event1 (after event3, event1 must happen).
   - State 3 and onward: event1 persists and no other events can happen (after event1 no other events can happen).

2. C1 is ""event2 or event3"".

3. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state event2 or event3 holds).

4. C3 is ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" — so whenever a state has event1, the next state must have event2 or event3.

5. Consider state 2 (and similarly state 3): event1 holds there. The next state (state 3 or state 4) also has event1 (since no other events can happen). Therefore in the next state event2 and event3 are both false, so C1 is false in that next state, hence C2 is false at state 2.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. System transitions: E2 -> E1 (must), E1 -> {E2,E3}, E3 -> {E1,E2}. Initial state is E2.
2. C1 is the state formula ""if event1 then event2"" (i.e. whenever E1 holds in a state, E2 must also hold in that same state). Since at most one event holds per state, this cannot be true in any state where E1 occurs (E1 would require E2 in the same state, which is impossible).
3. From the transition rules, starting at E2 we must go to E1 at the next step. So a state with E1 is reachable; thus C1 does not hold in every state. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
4. C3 is the implication ""if C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Its antecedent (C2) is false, so the implication is vacuously true. (Also, independently, event2 holds in the initial state anyway.)
5. Therefore C3 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Translate the hypotheses into propositional form (same-state implications):
   - C1: event1 → event3
   - C2: event3 → C1  (i.e. event3 → (event1 → event3))
   - C3: C2 always holds (C2 true in every state)

2. Simplify C2:
   - C2 is: if event3 then (event1 → event3).
   - In any state where event3 is true, (event1 → event3) is true because the consequent event3 is true.
   - In any state where event3 is false, the antecedent of C2 is false, so C2 is true vacuously.
   - Therefore C2 is true in every possible state (it's a tautology).

3. Check against the given transition rules (for completeness):
   - Initially event1 is true, so C1 is false in the initial state (event1 true, event3 false), but C2 is still true (event3 is false).
   - From event1 the only next state is event2, and after event2 no other events occur (so event3 never becomes true on the main trace). C2 remains true in those states as well.
   - Even on any branch where event3 might occur, C2 would still hold (see point 2).

4. Since C2 holds in every state, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is true.

1. We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.
2. C2 is: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds.""
3. C1 is: ""event3 or event1.""
4. So C2 is the formula: event3 → (event3 ∨ event1).
5. That implication is a propositional tautology (p → (p ∨ q) is always true), so C2 holds in every state.

1. C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""
2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means ""Event1 happens at some (current or future) state.""
3. From the context:
   - Initially, event3 happened (initial state has event3).
   - After event3, event1 must happen (so the next state is event1).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so it stays at event1 afterwards).
4. Therefore, starting from the initial state we have the sequence: event3 (initial), then event1, then event1,...
5. So C2 holds at the initial state (event1 does occur in the future).
6. C3 is ""C2 holds and event3 happens."" At the initial state:
   - event3 happens (true), and
   - C2 holds (true).

5. Event2 never occurs in this sequence.
6. Therefore, every second state is event3, in which event1 and event2 are both false — so C2 holds in those states.

2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C1).
3. C1 is ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., event3 holds in the current state — and in particular would have to hold in the initial state).
4. The context says the initial state has event1, and ""after event1, no other events can happen"" — so event1 is absorbing (the next state is again event1).
5. Since the initial state is event1, event3 does not hold there, so C1 is false.
6. Therefore C2 (¬C1) is true in the initial state.
7. The next state is again event1, so C1 remains false there and C2 remains true in the next state.
8. Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 asserts ""event1 always holds"" (i.e., in all states from that point on). This is impossible here: the initial state is event3, so event1 is not true initially.
- Moreover, no future point can make C1 true: after event1 the system must move to event2 or event3, so you can never have event1 in every future state (there is no self-loop on event1; and choosing event2 leads to a permanent event2 state).
- Therefore C1 is always false, so C2 (C1 and event1) is always false.

3. There is no rule that leads to event2 from any reachable state, so event2 never occurs on any run starting from the initial state.
4. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") holds, and it holds at every state; hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Use the context transitions:

- From event1 the next must be event2.
- From event2 the next must be event1.

   - Event1 happens initially, so the ""event1 happens"" part is true.

1. Context facts:

   - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so the next state is event2 or event3).
   - After event3, event2 must happen (so any event3 is followed by event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal, stays event2 thereafter).
   - Only one event holds in any single state.

Context trace:

   - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).
   - After event3, event2 must happen (from event3 you go to event2).

2. From the context, the only reachable behavior starting from the initial state is to stay at event2 forever (you start at event2 and cannot move to any other event).

3. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 always happens.""

1. Initial condition: event3 happened in the initial state (given).

2. Interpret the hypothesis at the initial state:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — a property about the next state.
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some (possibly later) state, the next state will be event1 (i.e., there will be a transition into event1 at some point).
   - C3: ""Event3 happens or C2 holds"" — a disjunction evaluated in the current state: either event3 is true now, or C2 holds.

3. Since event3 is true in the initial state, the left disjunct of C3 is true immediately. Therefore C3 is true at the initial state, regardless of C2.

1. C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state (from the initial state).
2. C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — a tautology (P → P), so C1 is true in every state.
3. C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is always true, C2 is true in every state (true ∨ anything = true).

3. C3 = ""C2 holds or event3 happens"" = always(¬event3) ∨ event3.

From the context: initially event3 happened, and after event3 no other events can happen — so the system is in event3 now and stays in event3 thereafter. Thus event3 is true in the initial state (and in all states).

Therefore:

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which simplifies to: Event3 happens.
2. C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. C2 = (event1 -> event3).
3. From the context: initially event2. After event2 → event1. After event1 → event2. There is no transition into event3, so event3 never occurs in any reachable state.
4. Consider C2 in reachable states:
   - In states where event1 holds, event3 is false, so (event1 -> event3) is false there.
   - In states where event1 does not hold (e.g. the event2 states), the implication is vacuously true.

1. Context transitions:
   - Initially event2.
   - After event3, event2 must happen (so from event3 the next state is event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (interpreted as event2 persists — no transition to a different event).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

2. Simplify the hypothesis formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to just Event2.
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore ""not Event2"".
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event3 happens"" is (not Event2) → Event3.

3. Examine reachable states:
   - The initial state has Event2 true.
   - From Event2, no other events can happen, so every reachable state has Event2 true (event2 persists).
   - Therefore not Event2 (C2) is false in every reachable state.

1. C1 is ""event2 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event2 in the current state).
2. C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — logically: event2 -> ¬event2.
3. The implication event2 -> ¬event2 is equivalent to ¬event2 (because p -> ¬p ≡ ¬p).

1. As in the examples, events are mutually exclusive in any single state (only one event can hold at a time).
2. C1 is ""event1 does not happen"" (i.e., not event1 in the current state).
3. C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — equivalently: event2 => (not event1). Given exclusivity, whenever event2 is true in a state, event1 is necessarily false in that same state, so the implication holds in that state.
4. The transition rules produce a reachable sequence from the initial state:
   - State0: event1 (initial)
   - State1: event2 (after event1)
   - State2: event3 (after event2)
   - State3: either event1 or event2 (after event3), and the cycle repeats.

1. From the context: initially event2. After event2 → event1, after event1 → event2. So the system cycles: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... Event3 is never produced by any rule and thus never occurs.

2. C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" This is true in the (only) run: event3 never occurs.

1. Context summary:
   - Initial state: event2.
   - From event2, next state must be either event1 or event3.
   - From event3, next state must be event1.
   - From event1, no other events can happen (it stays at event1).

2. Restate the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""event1 happens in the next state"" (next event = event1).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there will be some state at which its next state is event1).
   - C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""

3. Evaluate from the initial state (event2):
   - If from event2 the next state is event1, then C1 holds immediately, so C2 holds.
   - If from event2 the next state is event3, then at that event3 state the next state must be event1, so C1 holds at the event3 state; therefore C2 still holds (it holds eventually).

4. Since in every possible continuation from event2 there is some state whose next state is event1, C2 is true whenever event2 happens. The antecedent of C3 (event2 happens) is true initially, and the consequent (C2) is true, so the implication holds. There are no other ways for event2 to reoccur that would break this (after event1 nothing changes; after event3 you go to event1).

C3 says: in any state, if event2 holds then C2 holds in that state.

Step 2 — expand C2:
C2 = (C1 holds) or (event3 holds). C1 is “event2 eventually happens.” In temporal logic “eventually” (F) is true if the event holds now or at some future state.

Step 3 — consider a state where event2 holds:
- event3 does not hold in that same state (only one event holds per state).
- but C1 (“event2 eventually happens”) is true in that state because event2 holds now (eventually includes the current state).

Therefore C2 is true in any state where event2 holds.

The implication ""if event2 happens, then C2 holds"" is true in every state. Answer: True"

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event3 happened, and after event3 no other events can happen. So the system stays at event3; event2 never occurs.
- That means C1 (event3 AND event2) is false in every state (both cannot be true simultaneously).
  
Step 3 — evaluate the implication:
- C1 and C2 are the same formula. An implication of the form P → P is always true (reflexivity of implication), and an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.

1. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is equivalent to just ""Event1 happens"" (A and A ≡ A).
2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., ""event1 eventually happens"".
3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., ""eventually (event1 eventually happens)"". In linear time this is equivalent to ""event1 eventually happens"" (eventually-eventually P ≡ eventually P).

Now use the context:
- Initially event3.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

From the initial state:
- If event1 is chosen immediately after event3, event1 happens at the next state.
- If event2 is chosen, then by the rule after event2, event1 must happen at the following state — so event1 happens one step later.

Thus in every possible run, event1 occurs within at most two steps. So ""event1 eventually happens"" is true (C2 holds at the initial state), and therefore C3 (""eventually C2"") is also true.

Context transitions (one event per state):
- Initially: event1.
- After event1 → event2 (must).
- After event2 → event3 (must).
- After event3 → either event1 or event2.

Thus the possible runs from the initial state begin: 1, 2, 3, ... (then either 1 or 2, etc.).

Hypothesis parts:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., next state is not event1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some state C1 is false).

Evaluate at the initial state (event1): the next state must be event2 (by the rule after event1). So C1 is false at the initial state, hence C2 is true at the initial state. Since C2 already holds now, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

1. Interpret formulas:

3. Evaluate C1/C2 on reachable states:
   - In any e2 state: event2 is true and event3 is false, so (event2 → event3) is false. Thus C1 is false and C2 (¬C1) is true.
   - In e1 states: event2 is false, so C1 is true vacuously and C2 is false.

- At the initial state (event2), the next state is event1, not event2, so C1 is false there.

4. Start at the initial state: event2 holds.
5. From event2 the rules allow next = event1 (choice).
6. In that next state: event1 is true, event3 is false. So C1 is true and C2 is true (because event1 holds).
7. But event2 is false in that state, so C3 (C2 -> event2) is false there.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. G event2).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. G C1). Note G G p ≡ G p, so C2 ≡ G event2.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e. ¬G event2).

2. Use the context rules and initial condition:
   - Initially event2.
   - After event2, the next state must be either event1 or event3 (so the next state cannot be event2).
   - After event1 ↔ event3, they force an alternating 1↔3 loop thereafter.

3. From the initial state, no run can have event2 true at every time point (event2 holds at the initial state only; the next state is 1 or 3 and thereafter alternates 1 and 3). So G event2 is false.

4. Therefore C2 (G event2) does not hold, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C3 asks whether C2 holds in every state.
2. C1 asserts that event1 never happens.
3. The context says initially event2 happened and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — so the system stays at event2 forever.
4. Therefore event1 never occurs, so C1 is true (globally).

- Initial state: event2.
- From event2 → either event1 or event3.
- From event1 → event3.
- From event3 → event2.
So possible infinite traces from the initial state include:
- 2, 3, 2, 3, ... (always choosing 3 after 2)
- 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, ... (choosing 1 sometimes after 2)
(Only one event holds per state, as in the examples.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — false, because states labelled 2 (and 1) occur in every trace, so event3 is not true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" is equivalent to repeatedly asserting C1; that remains false (always(C1) = C1 here), so C2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds""
- There is a valid trace 2,1,3,2,1,3,... where event1 does occur.
- In that trace C2 is false (as shown above), so the implication ""if event1 happens then C2 holds"" is false in that trace.
Therefore C3 is not true in the model.

1. C1 is (event2 ∨ event1).
2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — as in the examples, ""eventually"" includes the current state (so if C1 holds now, C2 is true).
3. C3 is ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" That is, whenever we are in a state where event1 is true, does C2 hold from that state?

4. In any state where event1 is true, C1 = (event1 ∨ event2) is immediately true (because event1 is true).
5. Since C1 holds in that same state, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true (the eventuality is satisfied now).

Step 2 — logical relation
- C2 explicitly contains the conjunct ""event3 happens"". So whenever C2 is true, event3 is true (by definition of the conjunction).
- Therefore C2 -> event3 is a logical tautology (or holds trivially).

Step 3 — context (optional check)
- Under the given transition rules, C2 is in fact impossible (after event3 the next must be event1, etc.), but that only reinforces the implication (false premises make implication true). In any case, C2 implies event3 by construction.

1. Context transitions: from 1 -> {2,3}; 2 -> 3; 3 -> 2. Initial state is event2. There is no transition into event1 from 2 or 3, so event1 never occurs on any reachable run. The reachable behavior from the initial state is the infinite alternation 2,3,2,3,...

2. C1 = (event2 OR event1). Since event1 never occurs, C1 is equivalent on reachable runs to (event2). Thus C1 holds exactly in the states labeled event2 (every other state in the sequence).

3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"". At the initial state (which is event2), C1 already holds (event2 is true). Therefore C2 holds at the initial state (eventually includes the current state).

1. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to just Event2.

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is equivalent to (Event2 → Event3) evaluated in the same state.

3. In the system every state has exactly one event true. So in a state where Event2 is true, Event3 is false, hence C2 is false in Event2 states. In any state where Event2 is false, C2 is true (implication with false antecedent).

4. C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" means at every state where Event1 is true, the formula C2 must be true. At an Event1 state, Event2 is false, so (Event2 → Event3) is true there. Therefore C3 holds in every Event1 state. In fact, at states where Event1 is false the implication is also true. So C3 is true (including at the initial state).

- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state from the start onward).
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not true that C1 holds in all states).

Step 2 — Use the context to get the state sequence
- Initially event1.
- After event1 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → event1 must happen.
So the system cycles: event1, event3, event2, event1, event3, event2, ...

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false in any state where event1 holds (since then neither event2 nor event3 holds).
- The initial state is event1, so C1 is false at the initial state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in every state, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C3
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

3. C3: ""If event1 happens (now), then C2 holds (now).""
   - In any state where event1 holds, the antecedent of C2 (""event3 happens now"") is false (event1 and event3 cannot both hold in the same state), so C2 is vacuously true in every event1 state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Restate rules:
   - Initial state: event3 is true.
   - From event3, the next state must be event1 or event2.
   - From event1, the next state must be event2 or event3.
   - From event2, the next state must be event3.

2. Interpret the claims:
   - C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., event3 holds at every state / G(event3)).
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬G(event3): there is some state where event3 is false).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the future C2 is true).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - At time 0 event3 is true, but by the rules the next state after event3 must be event1 or event2, so at time 1 event3 is false. Therefore event3 is not true at every state, so C1 is false.

4. Evaluate C2:
   - Because C1 is false on the path (we have at least one state — time 1 — where event3 is false), C2 is true already at the initial state.

5. Evaluate C3:
   - ""Eventually C2 holds"" is satisfied if C2 holds at some time ≥ 0. Since C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is true.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted as a same-state implication (event1 -> event2). Since event1 never occurs in any state of the trace, the implication is vacuously true in every state. So C1 holds.

3. C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" At any state where event3 occurs, C1 (as established) is already true, so the implication holds. In fact C2 holds in every state (including states with event2, where antecedent is false, and states with event3, where consequent is true).

1. Initially event3 is true. The context says after event3 (and after event1 or event2) no other events can happen, so once event3 holds the system stays in states where only event3 holds. Thus event2 never occurs in any state.
2. C1 = (event3 AND event1). That requires event1 and event3 to hold simultaneously. That never happens (only event3 holds), so C1 is false in every state.
3. C2 = (if event2 then C1). Since event2 never occurs, the antecedent of the implication is always false, so the implication is true in every state (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
4. C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” The next state after the initial also has only event3, so event2 is false there and C2 is true there. Therefore C3 is true.

- C2: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (same as C1).

Step 2 — Use the context to check plausibility:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event3 must happen, so in the next state event3 does indeed hold.
- From there transitions continue (3 -> 1 or 2, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3), but that does not affect the logical relation between C1 and C2.

Step 3 — Evaluate C3:
- C1 and C2 are identical formulas. The implication P -> P is always true (a tautology).
- Given the context, next(event3) actually holds from the initial state, but even if it did not, the implication would still be true.

1. Interpret the formulas as state propositions (as in the examples):
   - C1: ¬event3 (in the current state).
   - C2: event2 → C1, i.e. event2 → ¬event3 (in the current state).
   - C3: event2 → C2, i.e. event2 → (event2 → ¬event3).

   - 1 → 2 (after event1, event2 must happen)
   - 2 → {1,3} (after event2, either event1 or event3)
   - 3 → 2 (after event3, event2 must happen)
   So reachable states are those where exactly one of event1, event2, event3 holds at a time.

3. Evaluate C3 in each possible state:
   - In a state with event1: event2 is false, so event2 → (...) is true (implication with false antecedent).
   - In a state with event2: event2 is true, so C3 requires C2 to hold in that state. C2 is event2 → ¬event3; with event2 true this requires ¬event3. In a state labeled event2, event3 is false, so ¬event3 is true. Thus C2 holds, hence C3 holds.
   - In a state with event3: event2 is false, so event2 → (...) is true.

1. Initial state: event3 is true. After event3 no other events can happen, so every reachable state has event3 true and event1/event2 false. Also only one event can be true in a state, so event1 and event2 never hold together anywhere.

2. C1 = (event1 AND event2). Because event1 and event2 never occur together (indeed they never occur at all after the initial event3), C1 is always false.

3. C2 = (event3 -> C1). In reachable states event3 is true while C1 is false, so C2 is false in those states (implication true->false is false). So C2 does not hold in the reachable states where event3 holds.

4. C3 = (event2 -> C2). But event2 never happens in any reachable state (after event3 no other events can happen). An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C3 holds in all reachable states.

1. Transitions from the context:
   - Initial state: event2.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → event2 stays forever (self-loop).
   - After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event3 never occurs).
   - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (irrelevant because event1 never occurs).

2. Which events can occur:
   - Starting from the initial state, the system remains in event2 forever. event1 and event3 never occur in any reachable state.

3. Interpret the formulae:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — this is always false in every reachable state because event1 never occurs.
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — also false, since C1 never becomes true.
   - C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" — an implication whose antecedent (event1) is never true in any reachable state.

4. Truth of C3:
   - An implication with a never-true antecedent is vacuously true. Since event1 never happens, the implication holds.

2. Understand the formulas:

3. Evaluate C2 at the initial state:
   - Initial state s0 = event3.
   - The rule after event3 forces the next state s1 = event2.
   - At s1 (event2), event3 does not happen, so C1 is true at s1.

Reasoning:
1. C3 is the claim that C2 does not hold. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds.""
2. C1 is ""Event3 happens AND Event1 happens"" — a conjunction that requires both events to be true in the same state.
3. By the model (and as used in the examples), only one event can be true in any given state, so Event3 and Event1 cannot be true simultaneously in any state.

Reasoning:
1. C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"" (¬event1).
2. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" = always(¬event1), meaning event1 never occurs anywhere along the run.

1. What C3 says: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Interpreting this as a state formula: in every state, if event2 is true in that state then C2 (i.e., ""C1 always holds"" from that state onward) must be true when evaluated from that state.

2. Unpack C1 and C2:
   - C1: event1 does not happen (¬event1).
   - C2: C1 always holds = from the current state onward, event1 never happens.

3. Build the possible execution(s) from the context:
   - Initially event1 happens (state0).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (state1).
   - After event2, no other events can happen → from state1 onward we stay at event2 (state1, state2, ... all event2).

   So the trace is: state0: event1; state1+: event2 (and event1 never occurs again).

4. Evaluate the implication in every state:
   - state0: event2 is false, so ""if event2 then C2"" is true vacuously.
   - state1 and later: event2 is true. From those states onward event1 never occurs, so C2 (always ¬event1 from that state) is true.

5. Since in every state the implication holds, C3 is True.

1. C1 and C2 are identical: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""  
2. Therefore C3 (C1 or C2) is equivalent to just C1 (since C1 ∨ C1 ≡ C1). So it suffices to check whether C1 holds in the system.

3. From the context: initially event1 is true. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. So there is a reachable next state where event2 holds. In any single state only one event holds (as in the examples), so in that state event1 is false while event2 is true.

4. C1 requires that whenever event2 is true, event1 is also true in that same state. The reachable state with event2 true and event1 false is a counterexample, so C1 is false. Consequently C2 is false as well.

1. C1 is ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at every state). This is false: starting in event3, the context requires that after event3 the next state is event2, so event3 does not hold at that next state. Therefore C1 does not hold.

2. C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" (C1 -> event3). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true at the initial state. (Also the initial state has event3 true, so C2 is true regardless.)

3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is true.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once at event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
- After event3, event2 must happen (so a state with event3 must be followed by event2).
- After event1, event3 must happen.

Hypothesis formulas (at a given state):
- C1: next(event1).
- C2: C1 -> event1 (i.e., next(event1) implies event1).
- C3: event3 -> C2 (i.e., if event3 then C2 holds).

Evaluate C3 under the context:
1. From the context the only possible run starting from the initial state is event2 forever (event3 never occurs because after event2 no other events can happen).
2. In any state on that run, event3 is false, so the implication event3 -> C2 is vacuously true.
3. Also, even if a state with event3 were considered, after event3 the next state must be event2, so next(event1) would be false there; hence C2 would hold as well. Therefore no counterexample exists.

Therefore C3 is True."

1. Interpret the context as state transitions:
   - Initially: event3.
   - After event3, event1 must happen (so from a 3-state the next state is 1).
   - After event1, event3 must happen (so from a 1-state the next state is 3).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would be terminal), but nothing allows reaching event2 here.

2. Possible executions:
   - Starting at event3, the system must go to event1, then to event3, then to event1, ... so the trace is an infinite alternation: 3,1,3,1,...

3. Evaluate the claims:
   - C1: ""event1 or event2"" — true in every state where event1 holds (false in 3-states).
   - C2: ""event1 or event2 eventually holds"" — from any state in the alternating trace:
     - From a 1-state: C1 already holds now.
     - From a 3-state: the next state is 1, so C1 holds at the next step.
     Thus C2 holds at every state.

   - C3: C2 holds in the next state (i.e. in the immediate successor state, C2 is true).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context the system starts in event2.
2. From event2 the next event must be either event1 or event3; from event3 the next must be either event1 or event2.
3. There is a valid execution that chooses the non-1 options forever: 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... . This infinite path satisfies all transition requirements.
4. On that path event1 never happens, so C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") holds and therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. Event1 does happen) is false.
5. The antecedent of C3 (""If event3 happens, then C2 holds"") is true on that path (event3 happens), but the consequent C2 is false, so the implication C3 is false on this execution.

From the context:

Thus the only possible trace from the initial state is: event3 (initial), then event1, and then event1 forever.

Context and transition rules:
- Initially event2 is true (initial state s0 = event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is a sink (s1 = event2, s2 = event2, …).
- After event3, no other events can happen → event3 would also be a sink (not reached here).
- After event1, next must be event2 or event3.

Interpretation of the C-conditions:
- C1 = (event1 OR event2).
- C2 = (C1 holds in the next state) = next(C1).
- C3 = (C2 holds in the next state) = next(C2) = next(next(C1)). So C3 asserts that two steps ahead, C1 holds.

Trace the timeline from the initial state s0:
- s0: event2 is true.
- s1 (next): must be event2 (sink).
- s2 (next after s1): event2 again.

Evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- At s2, C1 = (event1 OR event2) is true because event2 holds.
- At s1, C2 = next(C1) is true because C1 holds at s2.
- At s0, C3 = next(C2) is true because C2 holds at s1.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules:
- Initially event2.
- From event2, event3 must happen next.
- From event3, either event1 or event2 happens next.
- From event1, event3 must happen next.

Step 3 — reason about traces:
Starting at the initial state (event2) the next state is event3. From event3 you go to event1 or event2; from either of those states the next state is event3 (directly from event1, and from event2 by rule). Thus every run has event3 at every odd step (and in particular infinitely often), and from every reachable state there is a future (possibly current) state where event3 holds.

Step 4 — conclude:
Since from every state eventually event3 occurs, G(F event3) holds. Therefore C2 holds always, and C3 (equivalent to C2) is True.

1. Initially event3 happened. So C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is true (it happens already at the initial state).
2. C2 is ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — that requires a state where event2 is true and C1 is true.
3. From the rules: after event3, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen. So the only reachable sequence from the initial state is event3 → event1 and then stuck at event1.
4. Therefore event2 never occurs in any reachable state.
5. Since event2 never occurs, C2 can never hold.

1. Context (transition rules) gives a strict cycle: starting at event2, the next events must be event1, then event3, then event2, and so on (2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 ...). In each state exactly one event holds.

2. C1 is the same-state implication ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" (i.e., C1 ≡ event1 → event2).

3. C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" (C2 ≡ C1 ∧ event1). For C2 to hold in a state where event1 is true, C1 must also be true there. But with event1 true, C1 requires event2 to be true in the same state. Since only one event can be true in a state, event2 cannot be true simultaneously with event1. Therefore C1 cannot be true in any state where event1 holds, so C2 can never be true in any state.

4. C3 is ""if C2 holds, then event3 happens"" (C3 ≡ C2 → event3). Because C2 is false in every state, the implication C2 → event3 is vacuously true in every state (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

- From event2 the system goes to event1 or event3.
- From event1 it must go to event3 (next state).
- From event3 it must go to event1 (next state).
Thus the system alternates between event1 and event3 after leaving event2. As in the examples, events are mutually exclusive in a single state (only one event holds at a time).

3. Evaluate C3:
- In any state where event1 holds, event2 and event3 are false (mutual exclusivity).
- Therefore in any state with event1, C2 = (not event2 and not event3) is true.
- Hence the implication (event1) => C2 holds in all states.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system behavior is determined:
   - Initially event3.
   - After event3, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (it stays at event2).

   So the single possible trace is: event3 (initial) → event1 → event2 → event2 → ...

2. Interpret the claims:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
   - C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. (event3 → X event1).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" i.e. C2 is true at every state along the trace.

3. Check C2 on all states:
   - At the initial state event3 holds, and indeed the next state is event1, so X event1 is true; thus the implication holds there.
   - At every later state event3 does not hold (they are event1 or event2 states), so the implication event3 → X event1 is vacuously true.

4. Therefore C2 holds in every state, so C3 is true."

Context rules (deterministic next-step obligations):
- Initially event3.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

state0: event3
state1: event1 (forced by event3)
state2: event2 (forced by event1)
state3: event1 (forced by event2)
state4: event2

Context (transitions):
- Initially: event2.
- After event2 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1 → event3 must happen.

Goal: decide C3, where
- C1: ""event3 eventually happens"" (from the current state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state along the run, event3 eventually happens).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., from the next state, at every future state event3 eventually happens).

Check reachability and recurrence of event3:
- From event2 (initial), event3 must happen next — so event3 eventually happens. So C1 is true at the initial state.
- From event1, event3 must happen next — so C1 is true at any event1 state.
- From event3, the next state is either event1 or event2. In either case (event1 or event2) the following state must be event3. Thus from event3 there is a guaranteed future event3 (within two steps). So C1 is true at an event3 state as well.

Therefore, from every reachable state (event1, event2, event3), event3 will occur eventually. That means C1 holds at every state, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true globally. In particular, C2 holds at the next state (which is event3). Hence C3 is True.

1. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means event1 is true in the initial state. But the context says initially event2 happened. Thus event1 is not true initially, so C1 is false.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — from the initial state (event2), the context says after event2 no other events can happen, so the next state remains event2. Since C1 is false in any state where event2 holds, C1 is false in the next state as well. Therefore C2 is false.

2. From the context: initially event3, and after event3 event1 must happen — so there is a state where event1 is true.
3. As in the examples, states are labeled by a single event, so when event1 holds in a state, event2 does not hold in that same state.

2. Simplify C2: C2 fails only in states where event1 is true (because if event1 is true then ¬event1 is false and event3 is false as only one event holds per state). For states with event2 or event3, C2 holds (event2 states have ¬event1 true; event3 states have event3 true).

3. Use the context:

   - After event3, no other events can happen. So the system remains at event3 indefinitely; no transition to event1 or event2 is possible.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event3 is true.
2. After event3, no other events can happen — the next state must again be event3. Thus C1 (""event3 happens in the next state"") is true in the initial state.
3. C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" (a conjunction referring to the same state). In the initial state event2 is false (event3 holds), so C2 is false there.
4. Could C2 hold in any reachable state? The only reachable states from the initial event3 are states with event3 (because after event3 only event3 can happen), so event2 never occurs on the run. Therefore there is no reachable state where event2 is true, hence C2 never holds.

1. Interpret the claims:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the current state, the immediate next state is event1).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state where C1 is true, equivalently there exists some time t such that event1 occurs at time t+1. In short, event1 occurs at least once in the future.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — event1 never occurs.

2. Use the context transitions:
   - Initially event2.
   - After event2, event3 must happen (no choice).
   - After event3, event2 must happen (no choice).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (terminal), but we never reach event1 yet.

3. Trace possible sequence starting from the initial state:
   - time0: event2 (given)
   - time1: event3 (forced by rule)
   - time2: event2 (forced by rule)
   - time3: event3
   - ... — the system alternates forever between event2 and event3.

4. Conclusion:
   - Event1 never appears in any future state, so C2 (""event1 occurs eventually"") is false.
   - Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

5. From the context: initially event3 happened. After event3, event1 must happen — so event1 occurs in the next state.
6. Therefore ""Event1 eventually happens"" is true (it holds immediately after the initial state).
7. Hence C3 is True.

1. System trace (forced by the context):
   - Initial state: event1.
   - Next: event3 (must follow event1).
   - Next: event2 (must follow event3).
   - Then terminal at event2 (no further events).

2. Interpretations (as in the examples): only one event is true in any single state; propositions like C1/C2 are evaluated in a single state unless a temporal operator is present.

3. Evaluate C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" This means: in any state where event2 is true, event3 must also be true in that same state. In the state where event2 actually occurs, event3 is false (events are exclusive), so C1 is false in that state (hence C1 does not hold globally).

4. Evaluate C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" To be true in any state this requires both C1 true in that state and event2 true. At the event2 state, event2 is true but C1 is false, so C2 is false there. In other states event2 is false, so C2 is false there too. Thus C2 never holds.

5. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 never holds, C3 is true.

1. C2 is ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds"".
2. C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens"".
3. Context gives a deterministic cycle: starting initially at event2, the required next events are 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... so event1 does occur (and recurs) after event3.
4. At the next state (from the initial state): the event is event3 (because initially was event2 and after event2 must come event3).
5. In that next state, event2 is false, but C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true because from event3 the sequence forces event1 to occur next.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C3 says ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., there exists a state (now or in the future) where C2 is true.  
2. C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event1 and event2."" So C2 at a state is the proposition: event2 -> (event1 ∧ event2), which is equivalent to (¬event2) ∨ event1.  
3. The context: initially event3, and after event3 no other events can happen. So we start in a state where event3 is true and event2 is false, and the system stays at event3 forever (event1 and event2 never occur).  
4. In the initial state event2 is false, so the implication in C2 is vacuously true — C2 holds immediately.  
5. Because C2 holds at the initial state, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true."

1. We need to check C3: ""C2 eventually holds.""
2. C2 is: Event1 happens AND C1 holds.
3. C1 is: Event3 does not happen (i.e., not event3).
4. So C2 is event1 AND (not event3). Because only one event can hold in a state, any state where event1 holds automatically has event3 false, so C2 is equivalent to ""event1 holds in that state.""
5. From the context: initially event3 holds. After event3, event1 must happen. After event1, event3 must happen. Thus the system alternates: event3 (initial), then event1, then event3, then event1, ...

Context (transitions):
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Thus the system alternates event2 ↔ event1 starting from event2; event3 never occurs (but that doesn't matter for the logical implication below).

Hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event3 happens in the next state.
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds.

C1 and C2 are syntactically the same proposition (both are ""event3 in the next state""). The implication C3 is therefore p → p, which is a tautology: it is true in every state (true when p is true, and also true when p is false).

Therefore C3 is True.

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - After event1, event3 must happen (so the immediate successor of the initial state is event3).
   - After event3, no other events can happen (so once in event3, every next state is event3).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs here).

2. Interpret the conditions:
   - C1: “Event1 does not happen” — i.e., event1 is false in a given state.
   - C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the successor state, event1 is false.
   - C3: “C2 always holds” — i.e., at every state, the successor state has event1 false.

3. Trace the timeline:
   - State 0: event1 is true.
   - State 1: must be event3.
   - State 2 and onward: event3 continues (no other events can happen).

4. Check C2 at each state:
   - At State 0: the next state is State 1 (event3), so event1 is false there → C2 holds at State 0.
   - At State 1: the next state is event3, so event1 is false → C2 holds at State 1.
   - At every subsequent state (all event3), the next state is event3, so event1 is false → C2 holds everywhere.

5. Therefore C2 holds in every state, so C3 is true.

1. Interpret C1: ""Event3 happens and event1 happens"" — this is a conjunction that requires both events to be true in the same state. (As in the examples, only one event can hold in a single state, so a same-state conjunction of two distinct events is impossible.)

2. Therefore C1 is impossible (always false).

- Initial state: event2 holds.
- From event2, no other events can happen → the system stays at event2 forever.
- From event1, event2 must happen next (a rule, but since we never reach event1 from event2, it is never triggered).
- From event3, event2 must happen next (irrelevant because we never reach event3).

Step 2 — examine the hypothesis
- C1 and C2 are the same: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C3 = C1 AND C2.

Step 3 — evaluate truth
- Starting from the initial state the system remains in event2 and never reaches a state where event1 holds.
- An implication ""if event1 then event2"" is true whenever event1 never holds (vacuously true). Also the context already contains the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" which enforces the implication where event1 does occur.
- Therefore both C1 and C2 are true, so their conjunction C3 is true.

- Initially event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state is event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so it stays at event2 thereafter).

4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.
5. C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have C2 true and event2 does happen (in the initial state).

Context transitions:
- Initial state: event2 is true.
- After event2: event3 must happen (so next state from event2 is event3).
- After event3: no other events can happen (so event3 loops to itself forever).
- After event1: event3 must happen (not relevant here because event1 never occurs).

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., G C1).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" (antecedent ⇒ consequent; evaluate at the initial state).

Evaluate:
1. In the initial state (event2), the next state is event3, so C1 is false in the initial state.
2. Since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 (which requires C1 to hold in every state) is false.

   - After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant unless event2 ever occurs.)

   - C3: C1 holds or C2 holds — equivalently, Event2 does not happen.

1. Interpret formulas:
   - C1 is a state property: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., in that state event2 is false).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — from the current state, there exists a future state where event2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" — at every state along the run, from that state C1 will eventually hold.

2. Use the context to find reachable behavior:
   - Initially event1.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - There are no transitions to event3, so the system alternates forever: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3. Evaluate C1 and C2 on this run:
   - In event1 states, C1 holds (event2 is false).
   - In event2 states, C1 does not hold, but the next state is event1, where C1 holds. So from every event2 state, C1 holds one step later.
   - Therefore from every state (whether event1 or event2) there is a future state where C1 holds, so C2 holds at every state.

4. Since C2 holds at every state, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

1. C1 and C2 are the same statement: ""Event1 does not happen."" So C3 (C1 and C2) is simply ""Event1 never happens.""
2. Initial state: event3 happened.
3. From event3 the context requires: either event1 or event2 must happen next.
4. If from event3 we choose event1 next, event1 happens immediately — contradicting ""event1 never happens.""
5. If from event3 we choose event2 next, the context requires that after event2, event1 must happen (event2 -> event1). So event1 happens in the following step.
6. Therefore, regardless of the choice after the initial event3, event1 will occur (either at the next state or the one after).

1. C1 and C2 are the same proposition: ""Event2 does not happen."" So C3 = C1 or C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen.""

2. From the context:

   - After event1, event3 must happen. So the next state is event3.

3. Evaluate G(F(event1)) along the only possible path e2 → e1 → e1 → ...

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Timeline from the context:
   - Initially event2 is true.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → next state is event1.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → the system stays at event1 forever.
   - Event3 never occurs on this path.

2. Interpretations:
   - C1: (event2 → event3) — an implication that is only false in states where event2 is true and event3 is false; it is vacuously true in any state where event2 is false.
   - C2: C1 always holds (i.e., from the current state forward, C1 holds in every state).
   - C3: eventually C2 holds (i.e., there exists a future point from which C1 holds in all subsequent states).

3. Evaluate along the actual path:
   - At the initial state event2 is true and event3 is false, so C1 is false at the initial state.
   - Starting from the next state (event1) and forever after, event2 is false, so C1 is true in every state from that point onward (vacuously).
   - Therefore there exists a time (immediately after the initial step) from which C1 holds always — so C2 eventually holds.

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — means from a given state onward, every state has event2.
2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — means starting at the state after the initial state, event2 always happens from that point on.
3. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — we must decide whether it's impossible that event2 holds always from the next state.

Now use the context:
4. Initially event3.
5. From event3, the next state must be either event1 or event2.
6. If the next state is event1, then by ""after event1, no other events can happen"" the system stays at event1 forever — so event2 does not always hold from that next state.
7. If the next state is event2, the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" prevents event2 from occurring in the following step; thus event2 cannot hold in every subsequent state (it cannot persist), so event2 still does not always hold from that next state.
8. Therefore in every possible next state, C1 (""event2 always"") is false, so C2 is false.
9. Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. From the context:
   - Initially event1 holds.
   - After event1, event3 must happen (so time0:event1 -> time1:event3).
   - After event3, event1 must happen (so time1:event3 -> time2:event1).
   - Thus the system alternates: event1, event3, event1, event3, ...

2. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state"" = X(event3).
   - C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬X(event3).
   - C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" = X(¬X(event3)).

3. Evaluate at the initial state (time0):
   - time1 has event3 (because after event1 comes event3), so X(event3) is true at time0. Therefore C1 is true at time0 and C2 is false at time0.
   - At time1, the next state (time2) has event1 (because after event3 comes event1), so X(event3) at time1 is false. Hence ¬X(event3) at time1 is true, so C2 holds at time1.
   - Therefore X(¬X(event3)) at time0 is true (C2 holds in the next state).

So C3 is True."

Step 3 — examine both possible next states:
- If the next state is event2, then ""event2 happens"" is true in that next state, so C2 is true there.
- If the next state is event3, then event3 already holds in that state, so ""event3 eventually happens"" (C1) is true, hence C2 is true there.

Context transitions (one event per state):
- Initially: event1.
- After event1: event2 must happen (so the next state is event2).
- After event2: event3 must happen (next state event3).
- After event3: event2 must happen (next state event2).
Thus the execution sequence is: event1, event2, event3, event2, event3, ... (event2 and event3 alternate forever after the initial event1).

Interpret the claims:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (i.e., from the current state, there is some current or future state with event2)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the immediate successor state, event2 eventually happens)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e., for every state along the run, C2 is true)

Check C2 at every state:
- From any state, the next state is either event2 or event3.
  - If the next state is event2, then event2 already holds there, so C1 is true at that next state.
  - If the next state is event3, then by the rules after event3, event2 must happen in the following state, so event2 does eventually happen from that next state — so C1 is true there as well.
Therefore for every current state, the immediate successor state satisfies C1; hence C2 holds at every state.

Since C2 holds in every state, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is True.

- After event2, no other events can happen → the system stays at event2 forever; event3 never occurs on any reachable path.
- (After event1 no other events can happen and after event3 either event1 or event2 must happen are irrelevant because event1 and event3 never occur given the initial event2 and its terminal behavior.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1/C2:

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So evaluate C2 at state1.

3. C2 is: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" This implication is evaluated at state1. At state1, event3 is true (by step 1).

4. An implication (antecedent -> consequent) is true whenever the consequent is true. Since event3 is true at state1, C2 is true at state1 regardless of whether C1 holds there.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context gives the deterministic local transitions:
  - From event3 -> event2 (next must be event2).
  - From event2 -> either event1 or event3.
  - From event1 -> event3.
- C1: ""event3 happens in the next state"" — a state satisfies C1 iff its successor state is event3.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — from the current state there exists some future state whose successor is event3.
- C3: ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds.""

Consider any state where event3 holds. Its immediate successor is event2.
- If from that event2 the chosen successor is event3, then C1 holds at the event2 state, so C2 is true already one step later.
- If from that event2 the chosen successor is event1, then at that event1 state the successor must be event3, so C1 holds at that event1 state, hence C2 is true within two steps.

Thus whenever event3 holds, there is a future state whose next state is event3, so C2 holds. Therefore the implication in C3 is always satisfied. Hence C3 is True."

3. C3 is ""C2 always holds"", i.e. ""Event3 never happens at any point"".

- After event1, event2 must happen → next state is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once at event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
- The rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" does not apply because event3 is never reached from the initial state.

Thus the actual timeline is: event1 (initial) → event2 → event2 → ... and event3 never occurs in any state. Therefore C2 (not Event3) holds in every state, so C3 (""always C2"") is true.

1. Context (sequence constraints):
   - Initial state S0: event1 is true.
   - After event1, event3 must happen → S1 is event3.
   - After event3, event2 must happen → S2 is event2.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → from S2 onward it stays at event2.

2. Understand the hypothesis formulas (evaluated per state):
   - C1: (event1 → event3) — implication evaluated in a single state.
   - C2: C1 ∧ event3 — both hold in the same state.
   - C3: C2 holds in the next state (i.e., next-state(C2)). We ask whether C3 is true in the initial state S0.

3. Evaluate at the next state S1 (the state after the initial state):
   - S1 is the event3 state (by the context).
   - In S1: event3 is true, event1 is false.
   - C1 in S1: event1 → event3 is true (because event1 is false).
   - Therefore C2 in S1: C1 ∧ event3 = true ∧ true = true.

4. Since C2 holds in the next state S1, C3 (C2 in the next state) is true when evaluated at the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context gives deterministic transitions: from event1 → event2 → event1 → ... (event3 never occurs because nothing leads to it; from event3 one would go to event1, but 3 is unreachable). Initial state is event1.
2. C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" — a tautology (event1 → event1), so C1 holds in every state.
3. C2 is ""event2 happens and C1 holds"". Since C1 always holds, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (i.e., true exactly in event2 states).

   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event3 does not happen.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state two steps from now, event3 does not happen.

2. Follow the context from the initial state:
   - S0 (initial): event2 happened.
   - From event2, the next state S1 must be event3 (given).
   - From event3, the next state S2 must be either event1 or event2 (given).

3. Evaluate C3 at S0:
   - C3 requires that at S1, C2 holds. C2 at S1 requires that at S2, event3 does not happen.
   - But S2 is either event1 or event2, so in S2 event3 does not happen. Thus C2 is true at S1.
   - Therefore C3 is true at S0.

Context transitions:

- After event3 you must go to event2, so S1: event2.
- After event2 you must go to event3, so S2: event3, and so on (they alternate event3, event2, ...).

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""

Evaluate C2 in the next state S1:
- In S1, event3 is false (S1 is event2).
- But C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true at S1 because event2 holds at S1 (and recurs later).

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1 is true.
- From event1 the next state must be either event2 or event3.
- From event2 and from event3 no other events can happen (they are terminal states).
- In any given state at most one event holds.

Evaluate the formulas at the initial state:

1. C1: (event1 → event3).
   - In the initial state event1 is true and event3 is false (only one event can hold).
   - So the implication is false. C1 does not hold in the initial state.

2. C2: (C1 → event2).
   - In the initial state C1 is false, so the implication C1 → event2 is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).
   - Therefore C2 holds in the initial state.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1 = ""Event2 does not happen"" — a state formula true exactly in states where event2 is false.

2. C2 = ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. in a given state: event3 ⇒ (not event2). Since events are mutually exclusive in a state, whenever event3 is true event2 is false, so the implication is true in any state where event3 holds; and it is also true in states where event3 is false (antecedent false). Therefore C2 is true in every state.

3. The initial state has event3. The next state must be either event1 or event2 (by the transition rule after event3).

4. Evaluate C2 in both possible next states:
   - If next = event1: event3 is false, so event3 ⇒ (not event2) is true.
   - If next = event2: event3 is false, so the implication is true as well.

5. Thus C2 holds in the next state in all possible cases, so C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event2 holds.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initial state is event2. Transitions are deterministic:
   - after event2 → event3
   - after event3 → event1
   - after event1 → stays at event1 (no other events can happen)

   So the run is: state0: event2 → state1: event3 → state2: event1 → state3: event1 → ...

2. C1 = (event2 OR event3).

3. C2 = (C1 AND event3) = (event2 OR event3) AND event3. This simplifies to event3 (because event3 ∧ (event2 ∨ event3) ≡ event3).

4. C3 asserts: C2 holds in the next state. At the initial state (event2), the next state is event3, and since C2 ≡ event3, C2 is true in that next state.

Therefore C3 is True."

So C3 is equivalent to ""event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — use the transition rules starting from the initial state (event3):
- From event3 the next state must be either event1 or event2.
- If the next state is event2, then event2 already happens.
- If the next state is event1, then by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" the following state is event2.

In every possible case, event2 occurs within at most one transition from the initial state.

3. Because of that alternation, there are states where event2 holds (and states where event3 holds). So C1 is false (event3 does not hold in every state).
4. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — this would require some time after which event3 holds in every subsequent state. But the alternation continues forever, so no suffix of the run has event3 holding at every state.

4. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Whenever event1 holds (which is in every state of the trace), the next state is event1, so C1 holds; thus the implication is true. In states without event1 it would be vacuously true as well. Therefore C2 holds.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., at every state, the next state has event1)
3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event3 happens."" — an implication: (C2) → (event3 holds now).

Analyze the context/transitions:
- Initially event3.
- After event3, no other events can happen — so from the initial state the next state is event3 (it stays at event3).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (not relevant because we start at event3).

Can C2 be true in this system?
- For C2 to hold, in the initial state C1 must hold, i.e. the next state must be event1.
- But from the initial event3 the next state is event3 (no other events can happen), so C1 is false at the initial state.
- Therefore C2 cannot hold in any valid run from the initial state.

Since the antecedent C2 is impossible (false), the implication C3 is vacuously true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 = Event1 AND Event3.
2. C2 = Event1 AND C1 = Event1 AND (Event1 AND Event3) = Event1 AND Event3 (so C2 ≡ C1).
3. C3 is: If Event3 happens then C2 holds. Since C2 ≡ Event1 AND Event3, C3 simplifies to: Event3 → (Event1 AND Event3), which is equivalent to Event3 → Event1 (because Event3 → Event3 is trivial).
4. From the context: initially Event2. After Event2 → Event3, and after Event3 → Event2. Thus the system alternates between Event2 and Event3 forever. Event1 never occurs (no transition leads to Event1).
5. Therefore there are states with Event3 true but Event1 false, so the implication Event3 → Event1 fails in those states.

Reasoning:

3. If event3 happens at some state, C1 is false at that state (it asserts event3 does not happen).

5. The system allows a run where event1 (initial) is followed by event3, so event3 can indeed happen.

1. C3 is ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" So to show C3 we need event1 true now and C2 true now.
2. The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true in the initial state.
3. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state."" From the context, ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" so the next state after the initial state is an event2 state.
4. C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event3 → event2) evaluated in that next state. In the event2 state the antecedent (event3) is false, so the implication event3 → event2 is true there (and event2 is true anyway).
5. Thus C1 holds in the next state, so C2 holds now.
6. Since both event1 (step 2) and C2 (step 5) hold in the initial state, C3 holds.

2. Expand the claims:

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initial state = event3. From event3 the system must go to event1, and from event1 back to event3 — so the execution alternates indefinitely between event3 and event1. Event2 is unreachable from the initial state.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., event1 in every state) is false — the execution contains states where event3 holds, so event1 does not hold in every state.

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is the implication C1 -> event3 evaluated at a state. An implication with a false antecedent is true, and in the initial state the consequent (event3) is also true. Thus C2 is true in the initial state (indeed true in every state, since C1 is never true).

4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" asks whether C2 is true at some (possibly the initial) state along the run. Because C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is true.

Therefore C3 is True."

1. Interpret propositions as state formulas (consistent with the examples): ""Event1 does not happen"" means ¬event1 in the current state; ""Event1 happens"" means event1 in the current state.  
2. Context gives: initially event2. After event2, no other events can happen — so once in a state with event2, every future state is event2. Thus the trace is event2, event2, event2, ...
3. Therefore event1 never occurs in any state of the trace, so C1 (¬event1) holds in every state.

2. C2 is the state formula (event1 -> C1), i.e. it is true in any state where event1 is false, or where C1 is true.
3. C1 is (event3 -> event1), i.e. it is true in any state where event3 is false, or where event1 is true.
4. Check each possible state in the system (only one event true per state, and the system cycles 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 ...):
   - At an event3 state: event1 is false, so C2 = (not event1) or C1 is true (since not event1 holds).
   - At an event2 state: event1 is false, so C2 is true.
   - At an event1 state: event3 is false, so C1 is true; therefore C2 is true as well.

1. Initial state: event3 is true.

   - After event3, event2 must happen (so next state is event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (interpreted as event2 persists/stays — no transition to a different event).
   - After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant if event1 never occurs).
3. Possible execution trace from the initial state: event3 (initial) → event2 → event2 → ...
4. Does any state ever have both event3 and event1 true simultaneously? No. At the initial state event3 is true and event1 is false; later states are event2 only. There is no state where event1 occurs at all.

1. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., in every state).
2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists a future point after which Event1 holds in all remaining states.
3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not the case that eventually Event1 always holds).

Examine the context:
4. Initially event3.
5. After event3, event2 must happen.
6. After event2, event3 must happen.
7. After event1, event3 must happen.

From (4)-(6) the system is forced into an infinite alternation: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ... There is no allowed transition from event2 or event3 to event1, so event1 never occurs in any state of the trace. Even if event1 could occur once, (7) forces the next state to be event3, so you cannot reach a suffix where Event1 holds in every future state.

Therefore:
8. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
9. C2 (""eventually C1"") is false (there is no future point from which Event1 holds forever).
10. Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

1. From the context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen — so the system stays in event2 forever (event2 is a terminal/looping state). After event1 is also terminal, and after event3 the next state must be event1.

2. Which states are reachable from the initial state? Only the event2 state (it loops forever). Event3 and event1 are not reachable from the initial event2, because there is no transition away from event2.

3. C3 is the implication: ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds."" An implication is true in any state where the antecedent is false. Since event3 never happens in any reachable state, the antecedent is always false in reachable states, so the implication holds vacuously.

4. Therefore C3 is true in the model given the context.

1. Initial state (time 0): event1 happened.
2. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen, so at time 1 we have either event2 or event3.

4. If time 1 = event3, then ""after event3, event2 must happen"" implies time 2 = event2 (and event1 is false at time 2).

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is absorbing — system stays at event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, next state is event2).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 would also be absorbing, but it's unreachable here).

Hypothesis formulas:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (state formula: event2 ⇒ event1)
- C2: C1 does not hold. (i.e. C1 is false)
- C3: C2 always holds. (C2 is true in every state)

Evaluate C1:
- In the initial state event2 is true and event1 is false (only one event can hold at a time).
- For implication event2 ⇒ event1 to be true, whenever event2 is true event1 must also be true; here antecedent true and consequent false, so C1 is false in the initial state.

Evaluate reachability / future states:
- From event2 no other events can happen, so the system stays at event2 forever. No state will ever have event1 true.
- Therefore C1 remains false in every reachable state (event2 true, event1 false).

Thus:
- C2 (C1 does not hold) is true (it holds initially and always).
- C3 (C2 always holds) is true as well.

   - C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X C1 = X X event3.
   - C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" = F C2 (eventually includes the current state).

2. Build the timeline from the context:
   - s0: event3 (initial).
   - After event3, event2 must happen → s1: event2.
   - After event2, event3 must happen → s2: event3.
   - So the sequence alternates: s0:event3, s1:event2, s2:event3, s3:event2, ...

3. Evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial state s0:
   - C1 at s0 asks whether s1 has event3. s1 is event2, so C1 is false at s0.
   - C1 at s1 asks whether s2 has event3. s2 is event3, so C1 is true at s1.
   - Therefore C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" is true at s0 (because at s1, C1 is true).

4. Since C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 = F C2 is true (eventually includes the current state).

Reasoning:
1. From the context: after event1, event2 must happen. That means whenever a state has event1, the next state is event2.
2. If the next state is event2, then event3 is false in that next state (event2 and event3 are distinct events; only one event holds per state).
3. Therefore, whenever event1 holds now, the next state satisfies ¬event3, i.e. C2 holds.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1.
- From event1 → must go to event3.
- From event3 → must go to event2.
- From event2 → may go to event1 or event3.

Possible infinite behaviors:
- If after event2 we choose event1 repeatedly, the cycle is 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → ...
- If after event2 we choose event3 repeatedly, the cycle is 2 ↔ 3 alternation: 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ...

Evaluate the formulas:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — this would require every future state (including the next) to be event3. That is impossible because whenever event3 holds, the next state must be event2. So there is no state from which all future states are event3. Therefore C1 is false at every state.

1. Context: initially event2. From event2, the next state must be either event1 or event3 (by the given rules).

2. Simplify the hypothesis formulas:
   - C1 = event1 or event2.
   - C2 = C1 or event3 = (event1 or event2) or event3 = event1 or event2 or event3.
     So C2 is true in any state (since exactly one of event1/event2/event3 holds in each state).
   - C3 = C2 holds in the next state.

3. From the initial state (event2), the immediate next state is either:
   - event1: then C1 is true (event1), hence C2 true; or
   - event3: then event3 is true, hence C2 true.

4. Therefore in every possible next state C2 holds, so C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is True.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 holds.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once at event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
- The other rules (after event1, no other events; after event3 → event2) don't apply because we never leave event2.

Now the hypothesis:

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology — it's true in every state (implication holds whether event2 is true or false, and if event2 is true the consequent is true).

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds in all states, the antecedent is always true, so C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (i.e., C2 holds exactly in states where event2 is true).

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" The initial state is event2, so event2 (hence C2) holds immediately. Therefore C2 holds now, so it certainly holds eventually.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 = (event3 AND event1).
- C2 = (if event3 then C1) which is equivalent to (event3 -> event1) (since event3 -> (event3 ∧ event1) reduces to event3 -> event1).
- From the context: initially event3, and the rules give the cycle event3 -> event2 -> event3 -> event2 -> ... Event1 never occurs (no rule leads to event1).
- Thus event1 is always false. At any state where event3 is true, C2 is false (because event3 true and event1 false). At any state where event2 is true, event3 is false so C2 is true vacuously.
- The trace is: state0 event3 (C2 false), state1 event2 (C2 true), ... So there exists a future state where C2 holds.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is True."

- C1 is the state formula (event1 → event3). That is false in any state where event1 holds (because events are exclusive, event3 is false when event1 is true).
- Consider the state where event1 holds (which is reachable). In that state, C1 is false. Thus C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false there (the next state is event1 again, so C1 still false).
- At that same state, the antecedent of C3 (""event1 happens"") is true but the consequent C2 is false, so C3 is false in a reachable state.

1. System behaviour:
   - Initially event1.
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so from any event1 state the next state is event2).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so from any event2 state the next state is event1).
   - After event3, no other events can happen (if event3 ever occurs, subsequent states can only be event3).
   - Exactly one event holds per state.

2. Possible runs from the initial state:
   - Start at event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, ... — the system alternates forever between event1 and event2.
   - There is no rule allowing a transition to event3 from event1 or event2, and the initial state is event1, so event3 never occurs in any reachable state.

3. Evaluate the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" This is false in every reachable state (next state is always event1 or event2, never event3).
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C2 is true in every state.

Context transitions: starting state is event2. The required transitions are:
- after event2 → event3
- after event3 → event1
- after event1 → event3

So the run is: initial state event2, then event3, then event1, then event3, then event1, ... (looping 3 ↔ 1 after the initial 2→3).

Hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (a state formula true in any state where event1 is false).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some state at or after the current one, event1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., from the next state, there will eventually be a state where event1 is false).

Evaluate C3 at the initial state (event2). The next state is event3. In that next state event1 is false, so C1 already holds there. Therefore C2 (eventually C1) is true in that next state (since the eventuality is satisfied immediately). Hence C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is True.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2.
- From event2 → event3 must happen.
- From event3 → no other events can happen (so event3 loops forever).
- From event1 → no other events can happen (event1 would be terminal if it ever occurred).

Thus every reachable trace is: event2 -> event3 -> event3 -> ...

Hypothesis parts:
- C1: (event1 → event3) — a state formula; true in any state where event1 is false (implication vacuously true), and false only in a state where event1 is true and event3 is false.
- C2: C1 ∨ event2.
- C3: Always C2 (C2 holds in every state along the trace).

Evaluate on reachable states:
- Initial state (event2): event1 is false, so C1 is true; event2 is true; hence C2 is true.
- All subsequent states (event3): event1 is false, so C1 is true; event2 is false but C1 is true, so C2 is true.

Because C2 holds in the initial state and in all future states on every reachable trace, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 = ""event3 does not happen"" (¬event3).
2. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X(¬event3) (the next state has no event3).
3. C3 = ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" = (event1 → X(¬event3)).

4. From the rules: after event1, event3 must happen. So whenever event1 occurs in some state, the next state must have event3 true.
5. That makes X(¬event3) false in any state where event1 holds, because the next state necessarily has event3.
6. Therefore the implication event1 → X(¬event3) is false in any state where event1 occurs.
7. Such a state is reachable from the initial state (initially event2, then choose event1 next). Hence C3 is not satisfied.

Therefore C3 is False."

4. So the unique trace is: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2+: event3.
5. At state1, Event1 holds, so C2 (Event1 or Event3) holds at that state.
6. Therefore C2 holds at some future state (indeed at the next state), so ""C2 eventually holds"" is true.

1. Interpret the context: initial state = event2. Transitions allowed:
   - From event2 → event1 (must).
   - From event1 → event2 (must).
   - From event3 → either event1 or event2.
   There is no rule that allows moving to event3 from event1 or event2, so starting at event2 the system cycles 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 … and event3 is never reached.

2. Simplify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""Event3 happens"".
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — equivalently, ""If event3 then event1"".
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 must hold in every reachable state.

3. Check truth of C2 along reachable states:
   - Event3 never occurs on any reachable state (starting from event2 and following the required transitions).
   - An implication ""if event3 then event1"" is vacuously true in any state where event3 is false.
   - Therefore C2 is true in every reachable state.

4. Conclusion: C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True.

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens"" — interpreted as both event2 and event1 being true in the same state. (As in the examples, atomic event propositions are state properties and only one event can hold at a given state.)
2. In this system exactly one event holds in any state, so no state can have both event1 and event2 true simultaneously. Therefore C1 is false in every state (unsatisfiable).
3. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C1). Since C1 is false everywhere, C2 is true in every state — in particular it is true in the initial state.
4. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". Because C2 already holds in the initial state, C3 is true (eventually includes the current state).

Context (interpreting ""no other events can happen"" as a self-loop on that event and assuming one event true per state):
- Initial state: event1.
- From event1 the next state must be event2.
- From event2 only event2 can happen (event2 → event2 self-loop).
- From event3 would go to event1, but event3 is not reachable from the initial state.

So the only reachable run from the initial state is: event1, event2, event2, event2, ...

Now evaluate the claims:
1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. at every state event2 holds). This is false at the initial state (event1), so C1 is false (it does not hold globally).
2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At the initial state the next state is event2, and from that state onward event2 indeed holds forever, so C1 is true in that next state. Therefore C2 is true at the initial state. At state event2, the next state is event2 and C1 is true there as well, so C2 is also true at state event2.
3. C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is true at every state in the reachable run (both at the initial event1 state and at all subsequent event2 states), C3 is true.

4. The context says initially event3 happened, and after event3 no other events can happen. So from the initial state the system stays at event3 forever (no event1 or event2 ever occurs).

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = in the next state, eventually event1 holds = next(eventually event1).

Now use the context to get the state sequence:

- After event2, event1 must happen → State1: event1.
- After event1, event3 must happen → State2: event3.
- After event3, event1 must happen → State3: event1.
So the path is: event2, event1, event3, event1, event3, ... (event1 occurs at State1 and then infinitely often).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: starting state is event3. Transitions: 3 -> {1 or 2}, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 3. So runs alternate 3 with either 1 or 2: e.g. 3,1,3,1,... or 3,2,3,2,... or mixes.

- C1: ""event2 eventually happens"" (can be true at a state if event2 occurs now or later).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means from every future state, event2 will eventually happen (i.e. at every time point there is some later time with event2).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" — whenever event2 occurs, thereafter it must be the case that from every future state event2 will eventually occur.

- Counterexample run: 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, ...
  - At time 1 we have event2 (antecedent of C3 is true).
  - But after that (from the next occurrence of 3) we can choose event1 forever, producing no further event2. So there is a future state (the 3 after the 2) at which C1 is false (event2 never happens afterwards), hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false at the point where event2 occurred.
  - Therefore the implication in C3 fails on this allowed run.

Thus C3 is not guaranteed by the context, so C3 is False."

1. We need to check C3: ""Event3 happens or C2 holds.""
2. C2 is ""C1 always holds.""
3. C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""
4. Context: initially event3 happened, and after event3 no other events can happen — so the system stays at event3 forever.
5. Therefore event1 never happens, so C1 is true in every state.
6. Since C1 holds in every state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.
7. Also the initial state has event3, so the ""Event3 happens"" disjunct is true as well.
8. Therefore C3 (Event3 happens or C2 holds) is True.

   - If from s0 the next state s1 is event3, then by the rule after event3, s2 must be event2. So at s1, the next state s2 has Event2, hence C2 holds at s1. Therefore C2 holds at some future state, so C3 holds.

   - C3: C1 holds or C2 holds — equivalently, Event2 does not happen.

2. From the context:

   - After event1, no other events can happen (terminal state).
   - The rule after event2 → event3 is irrelevant unless event2 occurs.

2. From the context: initial state has event3 true. From event3 the next state must be event2, and from event2 the system stays at event2 (no other events can happen). Thus event1 never occurs on the run.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So consider the possible next states from the initial state.
2. Initially event1 happened. From event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3.
3. Case next = event2: event2 is true immediately, and C1 is ""event1 or event2"", so C1 holds right away. Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true in this next state.
4. Case next = event3: event3 itself does not satisfy C1, but after event3 either event1 or event2 must happen, and both event1 and event2 satisfy C1. So C1 will hold at the next step, meaning C2 is true in this next state as well.
5. In both possible next states C2 holds, so C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true."

3. Starting at the initial state (event1), the system stays at event1 forever. Event2 and event3 are not reachable from the initial state.

2. C1 = (event2 AND event3) — this requires event2 and event3 to be true in the same state. Given one event per state, C1 is impossible (always false).  
3. C2 = (C1) OR (event1). Since C1 is always false, C2 simplifies to just event1 (i.e., C2 holds exactly in states where event1 holds).  
4. C3 = (if event2 then C2). This requires that in every state where event2 holds, C2 (i.e., event1) also holds in that same state. But event1 and event2 cannot both hold in the same state, so C2 is false in any event2 state.  
5. The system does reach an event2 state (initially event3, then by the context the next state must be event2), so there is at least one state where event2 is true and C2 is false. Therefore the implication in C3 fails.

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1.
   - After event1 → next must be event3.
   - After event3 → next must be event1.
   - After event2 → next must be event3.
   Thus the system forces an infinite alternation event1 → event3 → event1 → … starting from the initial state. There is no allowed transition to event2 from either event1 or event3, so event2 never occurs in any reachable state.

3. Consequences:
   - C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false at every state (event2 never occurs).
   - Therefore C2 (""always C1"") is false.
   - An implication with a false antecedent is true, so (C2 → event2) holds in the model (vacuously true).

1. Context recap: initial state is event2. From event2 the next state must be event3. From event3, no other events can happen (so event3 holds forever thereafter). Thus the only possible trace is: event2 → event3 → event3 → ...

2. C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" (F event3). This is true because starting from the initial event2, event3 occurs in the next state.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G F event3). For every state along the trace:
   - At the initial event2 state, event3 happens next, so F event3 holds.
   - At any event3 state, event3 already holds (hence F event3 holds).
   Therefore F event3 is true at every state, so C2 holds globally.

4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F (G F event3)). Since C2 already holds from the initial state (indeed at every state), C2 certainly holds at some future state (immediately). Thus C3 is true.

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — meaning from a given state onward, every state has event2 (G event2).
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at the initial state, C2 means: at the next state, G event2 holds.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — we must decide whether C2 is false in the initial state.

2. Use the context to get possible sequences starting from the initial state:
   - Initially event3 (state s0 = event3).
   - After event3, event2 must happen ⇒ s1 = event2.
   - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen ⇒ from s1 the next state s2 is either event1 or event3.
   - After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ if s2 = event1 then s3 = event2, etc.

3. Can C1 (G event2) hold at s1 (the next state)? No:
   - s1 is event2, but the transition rules forbid event2 following event2; after event2 the next state must be event1 or event3. So not every future state can be event2.
   - Therefore G event2 is false at s1.

4. So C2 (G event2 at the next state) is false at the initial state. Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some state now or in the future, there is some state at or after that state where ¬event3).

From the context:
- Initially event1 happened, so in the initial state event3 is false. Thus C1 holds in the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so the system stays at event1 forever — event3 will never occur.

Therefore:
- C1 holds now, so C2 (eventually C1) is true (true immediately).

- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (event1 holds at every time point from the state where C1 is evaluated).
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" (a state formula: either event3 holds now, or the temporal property C1 holds from now on).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (C2 must hold at every state along the trace).

Evaluate along the single trace forced by the context:
- State 0 (initial): event3 = true. C1 is false here (event1 does not hold at this state), but C2 is true because event3 holds now.
- State 1 (next): event1 = true. From this state onward event1 holds forever (by ""no other events can happen""), so C1 is true when evaluated at state 1. Thus C2 is true at state 1 (since C1 holds).
- All later states: they are the same as state 1 (event1 forever), so C1 and therefore C2 remain true.

Therefore C2 holds at every state of the trace, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True.

1. System description:
- Initially event2 holds.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so from a state with event2 the only possible next state(s) also have event2 (the system is stuck at event2).
- Separately, event1 and event3 would alternate (event1 -> event3 -> event1...), but those states are unreachable because we never leave event2.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- This requires event2 and event1 to be true in the same state.
- Only one event can hold in any state, so C1 is impossible and therefore always false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 always holds.""
- Since C1 is false in every state, C2 (that C1 holds in every state) is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens.""
- This is an implication with antecedent C2. Because C2 is false, the implication is vacuously true (a false antecedent makes the implication true regardless of the consequent).

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen -> the system stays at event2 forever.
- After event1 → event3 and after event3 → event1 form a 1↔3 loop, but it's unreachable because we start in event2 and cannot leave.

Hypotheses:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 eventually holds (i.e., at some future state C1 is true).
- C3: C2 does not hold (¬C2).

Evaluation:
1. Since from the initial state the system stays at event2 forever, event1 never occurs. Therefore C1 is false at the initial state and at every future state.
2. Because C1 is false at every state, there is no future state where C1 holds. Hence C2 is false.

   - In LTL/F-temporal semantics, ""eventually"" includes the current state (there exists some position ≥ current with event1).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Start: initial state = event3.
2. Transition rules give a forced alternation: from event3 you must go to event1, and from event1 you must go to event3. So the infinite trace is: state0: e3, state1: e1, state2: e3, state3: e1, ...
3. C1 at time t means: the next state (t+1) has event3 (i.e., e3 at t+1).
   - C1 is false at t=0 because state1 is e1, not e3.
4. C2 at time t means: C1 holds at t+1, i.e., e3 at t+2.
   - At t=0, e3 at t+2 (state2) is true (state2 is e3), so C2 is true at the initial state.
5. C3 is ""eventually C2 holds."" Since C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is true.

Therefore the hypothesis C3 is True."

1. Initially event3 is true (time 0).
2. The context requires that after event3, event1 must happen, so at time 1 event1 is true.
3. After event1, no other events can happen, which (as in the examples) means the system stays at event1 forever from time 1 onward.
4. Therefore event1 does eventually happen (indeed at time 1), so C1 is True.
5. C2 is the same statement (event1 eventually happens), so C2 is True.

1. We must decide if C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.
2. C2 is: If event2 happens, then C1 holds.
3. C1 is: event1 happens or event2 happens.
4. So C2 is: event2 -> (event1 or event2).
5. Logical simplification: event2 -> (event1 or event2) is equivalent to (¬event2) ∨ event1 ∨ event2. Since (¬event2) ∨ event2 is always true, the whole formula is a tautology — C2 is true in every state.
6. If C2 holds in every state, it certainly holds eventually (already holds at the initial state).

1. Context gives the possible sequence of events:
   - Initially event1 happens.
   - After event1, event3 must happen (so the next state is event3).
   - After event3, no other events can happen (so once event3 occurs, the system stays at event3 forever).
   - The rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs in the reachable trace.

2. So the actual trace is: event1 (initial) -> event3 -> event3 -> event3 -> ...

1. From the context: initial state is event3; after event3 -> event1; after event1 -> event3. Thus the system alternates 3,1,3,1,... forever. Event2 never occurs in this trace (it has no way to be reached from the given deterministic transitions).
2. C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every state). This is false, because the trace contains states with event1 as well (so event3 does not hold in all states).
3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is a material implication. Since C1 is false, the implication C1 -> event2 is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). So C2 holds (already at the initial state).
4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds now, it certainly holds eventually. Therefore C3 is true.

Reasoning:
1. From the context, initial state = event3.
2. From event3 the system must go to either event1 or event2. If it goes to event2, event2 already holds; if it goes to event1, the rule from event1 forces event2 next. So from the initial state event2 will eventually happen — C1 is true.
3. In the next state (whether event1 or event2) event2 will still eventually occur, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true at the initial state.
4. C3 is the implication ""if C2 holds, then event3 happens"". At the initial state C2 holds and event3 is true (given initially), so the implication is true at the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event2 holds.
2. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" — that requires event1 to hold in the initial state (and every state). But the initial state is event2, so C1 is false.
3. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 is false.

1. Initial state: event3 is true.
2. From event3, event2 must happen next. From event2, event3 must happen next. So the only possible infinite sequence is alternating ... event3, event2, event3, event2, ...
3. Event1 never occurs (no rule allows it from the given initial state), so it doesn't affect the trace.

Now evaluate the claims:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., event2 holds at every state). This is false because the initial state (and every other event3 state) has event3 true, not event2.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 is false.

Context summary:
- Initially event3.
- From event3, event2 must happen.
- From event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- From event1, no other events can happen (terminal).

Hypothesis:
- C1: event3 or event2.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., at every future state, the event is 2 or 3 — equivalently, event1 never occurs).
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.

Consider possible executions starting from the initial event3:
- One possible run: 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... (alternating 3 and 2). In this run, event1 never occurs, so C2 is true; whenever event2 occurs, C2 holds thereafter.
- Another possible run: 3 → 2 → 1 and then stop (from event2 choose event1). In this run, event2 does happen, but later event1 occurs, so C1 (event2 or event3) is false at the terminal state and C2 (""always C1"") is false for that run.

Because there exists a possible execution where event2 happens but C2 does not hold (the 3 → 2 → 1 run), the implication ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" is not universally true in the model.

   - C2 is: event3 → C1, i.e. in any state, if event3 holds then (event1 ∨ event3) holds.
   - C3 is: C2 always holds (i.e. C2 holds in every state along every path).

2. Simplify C2 logically:
   - C2 is event3 → (event1 ∨ event3).
   - For any proposition p and q, p → (q ∨ p) is a tautology: if p is true then p ∨ q is true; if p is false the implication is true. So C2 is true in every state regardless of the transition structure.

3. Check against the context to be thorough:
   - From the initial event2, the system can go to event1 or event3.
   - In an event1 state, event3 is false, so the implication holds.
   - In an event3 state, event3 is true and event3 ∨ event1 is true, so the implication holds there too.

- From the context, after the initial event1 the system can move to a state where event2 happens.
- In any single state only one event holds, so in the state where event2 holds, event1 does not hold.

Reasoning (brief):
- ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) would require every state from some point onward to be event1. But from event1 the rules force the next state to be event2 or event3 (no e1→e1), so you cannot have event1 at every future step. Thus C1 is impossible (false in every state).

2. Context transitions:

   - After event3, no other events can happen → once at event3 the system remains at event3 forever.

3. Trace:
   - Start: event1.
   - Next: event3 (forced).
   - Then: remain at event3 forever; event2 never occurs at any point.

4. Therefore ""Event2 does not happen"" is true (C1 and C2 both true), so C3 (their disjunction) is true.

1. Interpret the statements at the initial state:
   - ""Initially, event3 happened"" means event3 is true in the initial state.
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — this asserts that the state immediately after the initial state is event2.
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — at the initial state, C1 is false (i.e., event2 does not occur in the next state).
   - C3: ""C2 holds and event3 happens"" — at the initial state, C2 must be true and event3 must be true.

2. Use the transition rules from the context:
   - After event3, event1 must happen. So given the initial event3, the next state must be event1 (not event2).
   - Therefore C1 (that the next state is event2) is false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so next state will be event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so it stays at event2 thereafter).
- After event3, no other events can happen (irrelevant here).

Hypotheses (read as state formulas):
- C1: (event1 → event2).
- C2: (event2 → C1).
- C3: (C2) ∨ (event2).

Evaluate at the initial state (where event1 is true and event2 is false):
1. event2 is false in the initial state.
2. C2 is the implication (event2 → C1). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 holds in the initial state.

1. Context (transitions):
   - Initially event2.
   - After event2, event3 must happen.
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
   - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

2. C1 = (event3 AND event1). This requires both event3 and event1 to hold in the same state. As in the examples, at most one event holds in a state, so C1 is impossible and thus always false.

3. C2 = (event2 AND C1). Since C1 is always false, C2 is always false in every state.

4. C3 = ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" For C3 to be true everywhere, whenever event1 occurs it must be the case that C2 holds at that state.

Context (interpreting each state has exactly one event true, and ""no other events can happen"" = self-loop at that event):

- From event1 no other events can happen → the system stays at event1 forever.
- From event2 you must go to event1 (irrelevant because event2 is never reached here).
- From event3 it stays at event3 (also unreachable from the initial state).

Evaluate the formulas at the initial state (event1):

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens"" (event1 → event3).
   - At the initial state event1 is true and event3 is false, so C1 is false.

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" (C1 → event3).
   - Antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is true (false → anything is true). Thus C2 holds at the initial state.

3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" (C2 → event1).
   - Antecedent C2 is true (from step 2), and consequent event1 is true (initial state), so the implication is true.

   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (there exists a future point after which ¬event3 holds at every state).

2. Use the context to trace the unique possible execution:

   - After event3, event2 must happen (state1).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (state2).
   - After event1, no other events can happen — the system remains in event1 forever (states state2, state3, ... all have event1).

3. Evaluate C2 at some future point:
   - From state2 onward, event3 never occurs (only event1 holds). So at state2, C1 (¬event3) holds at every future state; therefore C2 holds at state2.

4. Conclude C3:
   - Because there exists a future state (state2) where C2 holds, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event2 holds. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means the only possible next state from event2 is event2 itself (a self-loop). So the system stays forever in event2.

2. C1 is (event2 → event1). In any state where event2 is true and event1 is false (which is every state here), C1 is false. So C1 is false in every state.

3. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since every next state is event2 and C1 is false there, C2 is false in every state (in particular at the initial state).

4. C3 is the implication (if C2 holds then event3 happens). Because C2 is false, the antecedent of the implication never holds, so the implication is vacuously true. Therefore C3 is true."

1. C1 means: ""event1 holds in the next state.""
2. C2 means: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., at every state, the next state has event1.
3. The context gives: initially event1 holds, and after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen (so the immediate next state after any state with event1 must be event2 or event3).
4. If the current (initial) state is event1, then by the rule ""after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"" the next state cannot be event1.
5. Therefore C1 is false in the initial state, so C1 is not true at every state; hence C2 (that C1 always holds) cannot hold.
6. C3 states ""C2 does not hold."" Given the above, C2 indeed does not hold in every allowed execution.

2. There is no rule that ever leads to event3, and from event1 the next must be event2, and from event2 the next must be event1. So the only possible infinite trace is the alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3. With the mutual-exclusion of events (only one event can be true at a time), ¬(event1 ∨ event3) is equivalent to event2. So C2 ≡ event2.

Reasoning (step by step):

1. C1 = ""event2 eventually happens.""  
   C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ""event2 never happens.""  
   C3 = ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" = (event2 now) ⇒ (event2 never happens).

2. From the context: initially event3 → must go to event1 → from event1 we may choose event2. So there is a reachable state where event2 happens (sequence: event3, event1, event2).

3. At that state event2 holds, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true (eventually includes the current state), and hence C2 (""event2 never happens"") is false.

4. Thus the implication (event2 now) ⇒ (event2 never happens) is false in that reachable state, so C3 is not true in the system.

Therefore C3 is False."

1. Context constraints:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → once event2 occurs, the system stays at event2 forever.
   - (The rules after event1 and after event3 forcing event2 are irrelevant because event1 and event3 never occur from the initial state.)

2. Trace from the initial state: every state (initial and all future states) has event2 true; event3 never occurs at any time.

3. Evaluate the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" At the initial state, the next state is event2, so C1 is false (event3 does not happen next).
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asserts event3 at time t+2; since event3 never occurs, C2 is false at the initial state.
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" At the initial state C2 is false, so the implication C2 → event2 is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). Also event2 actually holds in the initial state anyway.

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens and event2 happens"" — interpreted as both event3 and event2 being true in the same state.
2. From the context, each state records exactly which single event happened at that step (as in the examples): you cannot have event2 and event3 true simultaneously in one state.
   - After event2, no other events can happen, so a state with event2 has only event2 true.
   - After event3, the next state must be either event1 or event2, but that doesn't make event3 and event2 true in the same state.

Reasoning:
1. Initially event3 holds, so C1 (event3 or event1) is true at the initial state.
2. C2 is (event2 AND C1). That requires event2 to hold in the same state as C1.
3. From the transition rules: after event3 must come event1, and after event1 must come event3. Thus the system alternates 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 ... and event2 is never reached.

1. Possible runs from the context:
   - Initially event2. Then event3 must happen.
   - From event3 either event1 or event2 happens next.
   - If event1 happens, it is terminal (stays event1 forever).
   - If event2 happens, the cycle continues (event2 -> event3 -> ...).

2. Interpret the formulas as state properties:
   - C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" means ¬event3 in the current state.
   - C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is the implication (event1 -> ¬event3) evaluated in the current state.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" means the implication holds in every state along every run.

3. Check C2 in any state:
   - In any state where event1 is true, event3 is false (events are mutually exclusive), so ¬event3 holds; the implication is true.
   - In states where event1 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

4. From the context: after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. One possible next state is event1 (with event2 false in that state). That reachable state makes C2 true (event1) while event2 is false.

   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, C2 is true).

2. System transitions:
   - Initially: event1.
   - From event1 → either event2 or event3.
   - From event2 → event1.
   - From event3 → event3 (stays at event3).

3. Is C1 true at any state? No:
   - From a state with event1, the next state must be event2 or event3, so event1 is not true in the next state; therefore event1 is not true at all future states. Hence C1 is false.
   - From states event2 or event3, event1 is already false at the current state, so C1 is false there too.

4. Thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true in every state (because C1 is false in every state).

5. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

1. Restate the context (transition rules):
   - Initial state: event1.
   - From event1: next is either event2 or event3.

   - From event3: next must be event2.

   - At later states (event1 or event2) C1 is false (no future event3).

3. C2 = ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""
   - At the initial state C1 is true, so C2 is true there.
   - At event1 states, event1 holds, so C2 is true there.
   - At event2 states, neither C1 nor event1 holds, so C2 is false there.

4. C3 = ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds.""

1. Timeline from the context:

   - After event1, event2 must happen → the next state is event2.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → once at event2, the system stays at event2 forever.
   - (After event3, no other events can happen is irrelevant because event3 never occurs given the other rules.)

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - From the initial state (event1), the next state is event2, so C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds.""
   - C2 requires event3 to occur (in the current state) and C1 to be true.
   - No state on the actual trace contains event3, and C1 is false, so C2 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is absorbing; the system stays at event2 forever).
- After event1, one must go to event2 or event3 — but event1 never occurs in any reachable state here.

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 = ""event2 holds in every state"" — false in the initial state because initially event1 holds.
- From the initial event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3.
  - If the next state is event2, the following state must be event3, so event2 does not hold in every state after the next state → C1 is false at the next state.
  - If the next state is event3, then C1 is already false at that next state (it isn't event2).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"", which is true."

2. C2 is ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""always Event1"" (Event1 holds in every state).

3. The context says: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. That means from the initial state the system stays at event1 forever (every future state has event1).

   - C2: event3 → C1.
   - C3: always C2 (C2 holds in every state).

2. Evaluate C1:
   - C1 is the formula p → p (with p = event3), which is a tautology. It is true in every state.

3. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 is event3 → C1. Since C1 is true in every state, the consequent of the implication is always true, so C2 is true in every state as well.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from event1 the system stays at event1 forever (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, event1 must happen → any occurrence of event3 would be followed by event1 (and then stuck at event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 would also be terminal if reached.

Evaluate C1, C2, C3:
1. C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" Starting from the initial state (event1) and because event1 is terminal, event3 never occurs. So C1 is false.
2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually we reach a state from which event3 eventually happens). Because event3 never happens anywhere reachable, C1 is false in every reachable state, so C2 is false.
3. C3: ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds."" There is no reachable state where event3 happens (event1 is the only reachable state), so the antecedent (""event3 happens"") is never true. Therefore the implication is vacuously true.

2. C1 = ""event3 does not happen"" i.e. ¬event3 (true in any state except an event3 state).

1. Context transitions:
   - Initial state: event2.
   - From event2: no other events can happen → system stays at event2 forever.
   - From event3: no other events can happen → event3 is terminal.
   - From event1: the next state must be event3.

   With initial = event2 and no outgoing transitions, the only possible execution is event2 at all times.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
   - On the only execution (event2 forever), event1 never happens, so C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens.""
   - At every state on the execution: C1 is false and event3 is false, so C2 is false everywhere.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret events as mutually exclusive per state (only one event can hold in a given state), as in the examples.
2. C1 = (event3 AND event2) — requires both event2 and event3 to hold in the same state. That is impossible given mutual exclusivity, so C1 is false in every state.
3. C2 = (not C1) — since C1 is always false, C2 is always true (holds in every state).
4. C3 = (if event2 happens, then C2 holds) — the antecedent is “event2 happens.” Whenever event2 holds, C2 (which is always true) also holds, so the implication is true.
5. Therefore C3 is True."

1. From the context: initially event1 happens.
2. The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur at the next state (so event2 does eventually happen).
3. The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" implies the system stays at event2 thereafter (but that doesn't prevent event2 from having occurred).
4. The rule about event3 is irrelevant because event3 never occurs in this run.

Now the hypotheses:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens — true (forced right after the initial event1).
- C2: Event2 eventually happens — same as C1, also true.
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds — since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.

1. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means event1 occurs in every state along the execution.
2. Start from the context: initially event3 happened.
3. After event3, event1 must happen (given).
4. After event1, event3 must happen (given).
5. Therefore the only possible execution from the initial state is the infinite alternation: event3, event1, event3, event1, ...
6. In that execution, there are states where event3 happens, so event1 does not hold in every state.

1. Interpret the context:

   - From event2 the next state must be event1.
   - From event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
   - From event3 the next state would be event1 or event2 (but nothing leads to event3 here).

2. Unpack the formulas:
   - C1 = ""event3 holds in the next state"" (next(event3)).
   - C2 = ""if C1 then event3"" i.e. (next(event3) -> event3).
   - C3 = ""if event3 then C2"" i.e. (event3 -> (next(event3) -> event3)).

3. Check reachable states:
   - The only reachable sequence is: initial event2 -> event1, and then no further events. No reachable state has event3 true.

4. Evaluate C3:
   - In every reachable state event3 is false, so the implication event3 -> (...) is true vacuously.
   - Therefore C3 holds (is true) in the system.

Context summary:

- From event1 the next state must be event3.
- From event3 the next state must be event1.
- (event2 never arises because no rule leads to it from the initial run.)

Hypothesis formulas:
- C1: ¬event1 (event1 does not happen in the current state).
- C2: next ¬event1 (C1 holds in the next state).
- C3: (next ¬event1) OR event1.

Evaluate at the initial state:
1. Initially event1 is true (given).
2. Therefore the disjunction C3 = (next ¬event1) OR event1 is true immediately because event1 holds now.

2. C2 is: event1 -> C1, i.e. event1 -> (event1 -> event2).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Transitions: initially event1 -> must go to event2. From event2 the next state is either event1 or event3. From event1 must go to event2. From event3 must go to event2.
- C1 is a state property ""not event3"" (i.e., event3 does not hold in the current state).
- C2 is ""eventually C1"" — which is satisfied if C1 holds now or at some future state.
- At any state where event2 holds, event3 does not hold in that same state, so C1 is true immediately. Hence C2 is true at every event2 state (eventually includes the current state).
- Therefore the implication ""if event2 happens then C2 holds"" is true in every state where event2 occurs.

Reasoning (brief):
- Transitions: from event1 → event2; from event2 → (event1 or event3); from event3 → event2.
- C1 = ""event2 does not hold"" — this is true in any state labeled event1 or event3.
- From any state:
  - If it's event1 or event3, C1 already holds.
  - If it's event2, the next state must be event1 or event3, so there is a future state where C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at every reachable state, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True."

1. Simplify the hypotheses:
   - C1: Event1 AND Event1 is equivalent to Event1.
   - C2: Event2 OR C1 is Event2 OR Event1.
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some current or future state where Event1 or Event2 holds.

2. Use the context rules and initial state:
   - Initially event3 holds.
   - After event3, event1 must happen. So in the next state event1 occurs.

3. At that next state (the state after the initial one) event1 is true, so C2 (event1 OR event2) holds there.

3. From ""after event3, no other events can happen"" we remain in event3 forever after that point.
4. So the execution sequence is: state0 = event2, state1 = event3, state2 = event3, ...
5. C1 = ""Event3 always happens"" — this is false at the initial state (state0) but true at state1 and every state after.
6. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is true at state1 and thereafter, C2 is true at state1 and thereafter (C2 is equivalent to C1 here in effect).
7. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" — because C2 does hold at state1, C3 is true.

1. From the context:
   - Initially event3 is true.
   - Transitions: after event3 → must go to event2; after event2 → must go to event3; after event1 → may go to event2 or event3.
2. Starting at event3, the only allowed next state is event2, and from event2 the only allowed next is event3. So the system alternates forever between event3 and event2. Event1 is never reached.
3. Evaluate the components:
   - C1 = (event2 or event3). This is true in every reachable state (every state is either event2 or event3).
   - C2 = (C1 holds in the next state). Since the next state is always event2 or event3, C1 will hold in the next state, so C2 is true in every reachable state.
   - C3 = (event1 happens) and C2. Because event1 never occurs in any reachable state, the conjunct (event1 happens) is always false, so C3 is false in every state.
4. Therefore the hypothesis C3 is False.

1. From the context we get the transition rules:
   - If current = event1 → next must be event2.
   - If current = event2 → next must be event1.
   - If current = event3 → next must be event1 or event2.
   - Initial state: event1.

2. From the initial event1 and the rules the system follows the infinite alternating sequence:
   event1 (initial) → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3. Interpret the claims:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is a proposition evaluated at a state: true at a state iff the following state is event1.
   - C2: ""C1 always holds."" Means at every state, the next state is event1.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Means at every state C2 is true (equivalently C2 must be true globally).

4. Evaluate C1 on the actual run:
   - At an event1 state, next = event2 → C1 is false.
   - At an event2 state, next = event1 → C1 is true.
   So C1 is not true at all states (it alternates).

5. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (because at event1 states C1 is false). If C2 is false, then C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also false.

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (true exactly in states where event2 holds).

3. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — so from the current state, the immediate successor state(s) must satisfy ""not Event2"".

Now use the context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen — so the next state could be event2 or event3.

- If the next state is event3, C2 (not Event2) holds there.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C3 says: in the next state, C2 holds. C2 says C1 always holds, and C1 is (event2 or event3).
2. Initially event3 holds. From event3 the next state is nondeterministically either event1 or event2.
3. If the next state is event2, then from event2 no other events can happen, so every future state is event2 and C1 holds everywhere → C2 holds in that branch.
4. But if the next state is event1, then C1 (event2 or event3) is false in that next state (because event1 holds), so C2 (C1 always holds) is false in that branch.
5. Since there is a possible next state (event1) where C2 does not hold, C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed.

Therefore C3 is False."

- Evaluate at the initial state (properties are checked from the initial state by default):
  - At the initial state event1 is true, so event3 is false now.
  - After event1, the next state must be event2 or event3, so X event1 is false → C2 is true.
  - But event3 is false in the initial state, so C3 = C2 AND event3 is false at the initial state.

1. Context: initially event3 is true. After event3, event1 must happen. So event1 does occur (in the next state).
2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a same-state implication. In these models exactly one event holds in a state, so when event1 holds in a state, event2 does not hold in that same state. Because event1 does occur (from step 1) and event2 does not hold simultaneously, C1 is false.
3. C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false regardless of whether event2 ever occurs.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initial state S0: event2 is true.
2. From event2, the next state S1 must be either event1 or event3 (nondeterministic choice).
3. Consider the choice S1 = event1 (allowed by the context).
4. From event1, the next state S2 must be event3.
5. So one possible run is S0: event2 → S1: event1 → S2: event3.
6. C1 is the state formula ""if event3 happens then event1 happens"" (event3 → event1). In S2, event3 is true while event1 is false (only one event holds per state), so C1 is false in S2.
7. C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — that is, in S1 we require C1 to hold in S2; but we just showed C1 is false in S2, so C2 is false in S1 for this run.
8. C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" — from S0 we require C2 to hold in S1; since there is a valid run where C2 is false in S1, C3 is not guaranteed from the initial state.

Therefore C3 is False."

1. Context summary:
   - Initial state: event2.
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so next state after initial is event1).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once at event1, all future states remain event1).
   - After event3, no other events can happen (irrelevant here).

2. Determine the timeline:
   - t0: event2 (initial).
   - t1: event1 (forced by ""after event2, event1 must happen"").
   - t2, t3, ...: event1 (stuck at event1 forever because ""after event1, no other events can happen"").

3. Interpret the hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every state from the current point onward).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists a future state where C1 is true).
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (C2 is true at t1).

4. Evaluate at t1 (the next state):
   - From t1 onward, all states are event1; event2 does not occur at t1 or any later time.
   - Therefore C1 (event2 holds at every future state) is false at t1 and at all times after.
   - If C1 is never true at any future state, then C2 (""eventually C1"") is false at t1.

5. Conclusion:
   - C2 does not hold in the next state, so C3 is False.

1. Translate the context:
   - Initially event2 is true.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → the system stays at event2 forever.
   - After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant here since event1 never occurs).
   - After event3, no other events can happen (irrelevant here).

2. Understand the hypothesis formulas:
   - C1: event3 AND event2 (both true in the same state).
   - C2: C1 eventually holds (there is some state where C1 is true).
   - C3: event2 happens AND C2 holds.

   (As in the examples, conjunctions are evaluated within a single state; only one event can be true in any state.)

3. From the context the only reachable state sequence is event2 forever. Event3 never occurs in any state.

4. Therefore C1 (both event2 and event3 true in one state) is impossible → C1 is always false. Hence C2 (C1 eventually holds) is false.

5. C3 requires event2 (true initially) AND C2 (false) → C3 is false.

Reasoning:
- States: only one event true per state. Transitions: event1 -> event2; event2 -> (event1 or event3); event3 -> event1. Initial state is event2.
- C1 = ""next state is event2"". C2 = ""C1 holds OR current state is event3"".
- At the initial state (current = event2), current event3 is false. From event2 the system may go to event1 next, so C1 can be false. Thus there is a reachable case where both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false at the initial state.

- From event1 the next state must be event3.
- From event3 no other events can happen (it stays at event3).
- From event2 the next state must be event1.

Evaluate at the initial state (event1 true, event2 false, event3 false):

4. The initial state has event1 true (given). That means event3 is not true in the initial state.

1. C1: ""Event3 always happens"" means every state has event3. That is false immediately because the initial state is event2, not event3.

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means there is a time after which event3 holds in every subsequent state (i.e., we eventually reach event3 and stay there).

3. From a state with event2, the rules say the next state must be either event1 or event3.
   - If the choice is event3, then we reach the terminal event3 state and from then on event3 always holds, so C2 is true on that run.
   - But the choice could be event1; after event1 the next state must be event2, and from that event2 again we can choose event1, etc. So there is a possible infinite run alternating event2 ↔ event1 that never reaches event3.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The context enforces a cycle: event1 → event2 → event3 → event1 → … (only one event true per state).
2. Interpret C1 as a state-level implication: C1 = (event2 → event3).
   - In any state where event2 is true, event3 is false (only one event per state), so C1 is false in event2 states.
   - In event3 states C1 is true (antecedent false), and in event1 states C1 is also true (antecedent false).
3. C2 = (event3 ∧ C1). That is true only in event3 states (there event3 is true and C1 holds).
4. C3 = “C2 always holds” would require C2 to be true in every state. But in the initial state (event1) event3 is false, so C2 is false there.

Reasoning, step by step:

1. Only one event can hold in any single state. C1 asserts (event2 AND event3) in the same state, so C1 is impossible and therefore false in every state.

2. C2 is the implication (if C1 then event1). Since C1 is always false, the implication is vacuously true in every state — so C2 holds everywhere (including the initial state).

3. C3 is the implication (if C2 then event3). Because C2 is true in the initial state, C3 requires event3 to be true in that state. But the initial state has event2 (not event3). Therefore the implication is false in the initial state, so C3 does not hold.

Step 2 — examine the context / transition rules:
- Initially event3 is true.
- After event3, event2 must happen (no alternative).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

Thus the system deterministically alternates: event3 -> event2 -> event3 -> event2 -> ... . There is no rule allowing event1 to occur from event3 or event2, and event1 is not true initially.

Step 3 — conclusion about Event1 eventually happening:
- Event1 cannot be reached in any future state starting from the initial event3 (the system is stuck alternating between event2 and event3).

   - From event3 no further events occur (and in an event3 state, event1 and event2 are false).

3. Reachability:
   - From the initial event2 state we can take the transition event2 -> event3.

   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" becomes ""event2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future state event2 is true).
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" means: in the next state it will be true that event2 eventually holds (from that next state there is some future state with event2).

2. Examine the context and transitions:
   - Initially event2.
   - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (nondeterministic choice).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (stays at event1 forever).
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

3. Check C3 (property in the next state):
   - If the next state after the initial event2 is event1: then no other events can happen, so event2 will never occur again. Thus C2 is false in that next state.
   - If the next state is event3: then there is a continuation where event2 happens later, so C2 could be true in that next state.
   - Because there exists a possible next state (event1) where C2 is false, C3 (that C2 holds in the next state) is not guaranteed.

Therefore C3 is False."

1. We evaluate C3 at the initial state. C3 = (Event1) OR C2.
2. At the initial state, Event3 is true, so Event1 is false now. Therefore we must check C2.

1. C3 says: C2 always holds. So we must check whether C2 is true in every state.
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" = not(event1 or event2). So C2 holds in a state exactly when neither event1 nor event2 holds (i.e., the state would have event3).
3. C1 is ""event1 or event2"".

1. From the context the possible transitions (one event true per state) are:
   - initial state: event3 is true
   - 3 -> 2 (after event3, event2 must happen)
   - 2 -> 1 (after event2, event1 must happen)

2. C1 = (event3 and event1). Since exactly one event holds in any state, C1 is false in every state.

3. C2 = (C1) or (event2). Because C1 is always false, C2 is equivalent to (event2) — i.e., C2 holds exactly in states labeled event2.

4. C3 = (event1) and (C2). Substituting, C3 requires a state where both event1 and event2 hold simultaneously.

5. No state can have both event1 and event2 true at the same time. Also the initial state is event3, so C3 is not true initially.

   - If C1 means ""event2 never happens (globally)"": C1 is also true, because after the initial event3 no other events ever occur.

3. C2 is ""event2 happens and C1 holds."" That requires event2 to be true in some state while simultaneously C1 holds in that same state (or globally). In both readings of C1 this is contradictory:
   - If C1 is ""event2 does not happen in the current state"", C2 requires event2 both to happen and not happen in the same state — impossible.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""event2 does not happen"" (¬event2).
2. C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"": event2 → ¬event2. That formula is equivalent to ¬event2 (because A → ¬A is true exactly when ¬A holds).
3. So C2 is simply ""event2 does not happen"" in the evaluated state.
4. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen. So there is an allowed next state where event2 happens.
5. In that next state (where event2 is true), C2 (¬event2) is false.
6. Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed and is false."

Context sequence from the rules:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen → next state is event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → it stays at event1 forever.
- After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant because we never reach event3).

So the actual state sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 → event1 → ...

Evaluate the propositions at the initial state (where truth is usually checked):

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" = ¬event2. At the initial state event2 is true, so C1 is false.
2. C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" = event1 ∨ C1. At the initial state event1 is false and C1 is false, so C2 is false.
3. C3: ""Event3 happens or C2 holds"" = event3 ∨ C2. At the initial state event3 is false and C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Also, in the whole future trace no state has event3 (the system goes to event1 and stays there), so there is no state where event3 is true that could make C3 true later.

Therefore C3 is False."

3. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., event2 must hold in every state along execution(s).

4. The initial state has event2 true, so C2 holds initially. But from event2 the system may move next to event1 (or event3). If it goes to event1, event2 is false in that next state (event1 is terminal), so C2 does not hold there. Thus there exists an execution where C2 does not hold at some future state.

1. Context transitions:

   So the system alternates: event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ...

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
   - At the initial state event2 happened, so C1 is false at the initial state.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state event2 does not happen).
   - C2 requires C1 to be true in every state, but C1 is false at the initial state. Therefore C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., there exists a future point after which C1 holds in all states).
   - Because the system alternates between event2 and event3 indefinitely, event2 occurs infinitely often; there is no future point after which event2 never happens.
   - Thus there is no suffix of the run where C1 holds in every state, so C2 never becomes true at any future point.

- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so the next state cannot be event1).
- After event2 and after event3, no other events can happen (they are terminal states).

1. Interpret transitions as ""next state"" requirements (as in the examples): after event1 the next state must be event2; after event2 the next state must be event1; after event3 the next state must be event1. Only one event holds in each state, and the initial state is event1.

Reasoning:
1. C1 = (event2 AND event2) simplifies to event2.
2. C2 = (if C1 then event3) is equivalent to (event2 → event3).
3. C3 = C2 AND event3, i.e. (event2 → event3) AND event3.
4. Starting from the initial state event1 → must go to event2 → can go to event3. In the event3 state, event3 is true.
5. In any state where event3 is true, the implication (event2 → event3) holds (either antecedent is false or consequent true), so C2 holds there.
6. Therefore at the reachable event3 state both C2 and event3 hold, so C3 holds at that state.

Thus C3 can be satisfied (eventually), so the correct answer is True."

1. From the context only one event can hold in a single state (as in the examples). Initially event1 is true; event2 is false in that state.
2. C1 is ""event1 and event2"" (both true in the same state). Because at most one event is true in any state, C1 is impossible — C1 is false in every state.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial state is event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event3 never occurs).

Evaluate the components:
- C1: event2 or event3. This is true in the initial state (event2 is true there).
- C2: event3 and C1. That requires event3 to be true in some state (and then C1 would also hold there). But in this system, starting from the initial state event3 never occurs: from event2 we must go to event1, and after event1 nothing else happens. So there is no state with event3 true.

1. Context transitions:
- Initially event3 holds (call this state S0).
- After event3, event1 must happen → S0's next state S1 has event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → S1 transitions to itself (stays at event1) forever.

So the only reachable sequence is S0(event3) → S1(event1) → S1 → ...

2. Interpret the formulas:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" So C1 is true at a state iff the immediate successor state has event2.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 must be true at every state on the path.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state, C2 must be true.

3. Evaluate C1 on the path:
- At S0, the next state S1 has event1 (not event2) → C1 is false at S0.
- At S1, the next state is S1 with event1 → C1 is false at S1.
Thus C1 is false at all states.

4. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (C1 does not hold anywhere).

5. C3 requires that C2 hold in the next state (i.e., C2 true at S1). But C2 is false at S1, so C3 is false at the initial state.

   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — negation: there is some state where C1 is false (i.e., event1 occurs at some point).

2. Follow the context constraints from the initial state:
   - Initially event2 happens.
   - After event2, event3 must happen → the next state is event3.
   - After event3, no other events can happen → once at event3 the execution stays at event3 forever.
   - The rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs along this execution.

3. Trace the only possible execution: event2 (initial) → event3 → event3 → ...
   - In every state of this execution, event1 is false.

4. Therefore C1 holds in every state, so C2 is true. Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the examples' conventions, events are exclusive in a single state (only one event true at a time).  
2. C1 is ""event3 AND event2"" — that requires both events true in the same state, which is impossible. So C1 can never hold in any state.  
3. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 can never hold, C2 is false (never holds).  
4. C3 is ""event2 happens OR C2 holds."" Without an ""eventually"", ""event2 happens"" is evaluated at the current (initial) state; initially event3 is true, so event2 is false now. And C2 is false.  
5. Therefore C3 is false at the initial state.

(If one instead read ""event2 happens"" as ""event2 happens at some future time,"" it still is not guaranteed: from event3 the system may nondeterministically go to event1 and then loop event1→event3→event1…, so event2 need not occur.)"

1. From the context: initially event2 is true. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So the only possible run is:

   Event3 never occurs in this run.

Reasoning:
1. From the context the allowed transitions are:
   - initially state = event2
   - after event2, event1 must occur
   - after event1, either event2 or event3 occurs
   - after event3, event2 must occur
   So possible runs cycle 2→1→2→1→... or 2→1→3→2→1→3→...

2. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") requires event2 to hold at every time point. That is false because immediately after any event2 the next state must be event1, so there are states where event1 (not event2) holds.

3. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") would require that from some future point onward event2 holds at every state. That cannot happen: whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event1, so you can never reach a suffix where event2 holds at every time. Thus C2 is false.

4. The context: initially event2 happened. The rule ""After event2, either event1, or event3 must happen"" means the next state must be event1 or event3 — it cannot be event2.

5. Therefore C1 is false in the next state, so C3 (which equals C1) is false.

Context summary:
- s0 (initial): event3.
- After event3, no other events can happen → every future state is event3 (s1 = event3, s2 = event3, ...).
- After event1 or event2, the next state must be event3 (irrelevant here because we start at event3 and never leave).

Evaluate the formulas at the initial state s0:
1. C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" — at s0, the next state s1 is event3, so C1 is True.
2. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is True at s0, C2 is False at s0.
3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this requires C2 to be True at s1. But at s1 the next state s2 is event3, so C1 is True at s1 and therefore C2 is False at s1. Thus C3 is False at s0.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context, exactly one event is true in any state, and transitions are:
   - Initially event1.
   - After event1 → event3 (must).
   - After event3 → event1 or event2.
   - After event2 → event3 (must).

2. Examine C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted at a single state, this is the proposition (event3 → event2). Because at any state at most one event is true, whenever event3 is true event2 is false in that same state, so the implication is false in every state where event3 occurs. (It is only vacuously true in states without event3.)

3. Examine C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" = event3 ∧ (event3 → event2). For a state with event3, the implication (event3 → event2) is false (see 2), so C2 is false in any state where event3 occurs. There is no state where both event3 and event2 hold simultaneously, so C2 is never true.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds"" requires C2 to be true in every state. Since C2 is never true (and in particular the immediate successor of the initial state is event3 where C2 is false), C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Now use the context:
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

So the execution is event2, event3, event2, event3, ... — event2 holds only in every other state, not in every state. Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Translate the context into allowed transitions between states (each state has exactly one event true):
   - From event1: the next state must be either event2 or event3 (nondeterministic choice).
   - From event2: the next state must be event1.
   - From event3: the next state must be event2.
   - Initial state: event1.

2. Interpret the claims:
   - C1 = ""event3 holds in the next state"" (X event3).
   - C2 = ""eventually C1 holds"" (F C1).
   - C3 = ""eventually C2 holds"" (F C2).

3. To show C3 true given the context it must hold on every possible execution (every possible infinite path from the initial state). Find a counterexample path:
   - Choose the nondeterministic option at event1 to go to event2.
   - From event2 you must go to event1, and again choose event2, etc.
   - This yields the infinite path: 1,2,1,2,1,2,... with no occurrences of event3.

4. On that path:
   - C1 (next is event3) is never true at any state (the successors are always 2 or 1, never 3).
   - So C2 (eventually C1) is false at every state on the path.
   - Hence C3 (eventually C2) is false as well on this path.

5. Because there exists a valid execution from the initial state where C3 does not hold, C3 is not guaranteed by the context.

Therefore the hypothesis C3 is False."

1. From the context: initially event1 holds. After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So the only reachable behavior (absent event3) is an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

2. Interpret C1 as a state formula: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event1 -> event2 evaluated in the same state). With the one-event-per-state assumption, in a state where event1 holds, event2 does not hold, so C1 is false in that state. C1 is true in states where event1 is false (e.g., event2 states).

3. C2 is ""event2 happens or C1 holds"". In an event1 state, event2 is false and C1 (as just noted) is false, so C2 is false in any event1 state.

4. Context: initially event3. After event3, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event3 forever; event2 and event1 never occur after the initial state.

1. Interpret C1 as a state formula: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens"" ≡ (not event1) or event3.
2. Initial state: event1 is true, event3 is false (event3 is not mentioned as happening initially).
3. Evaluate C1 at the initial state: (not event1) or event3 = false or false = false. So C1 is false initially.
4. C2 = C1 holds and event1 happens. Since C1 is false at the initial state, C2 is false at the initial state (even though event1 is true).

Reasoning:
- C1 is the state formula ""if event3 then event1"", which is false exactly in states where event3 is true (and event1 is false).
- The initial state has event3 true, so C1 is false initially.
- But after event3, the system must go to either event1 or event2.
  - If it goes to event1, C1 holds (event1 is true).
  - If it goes to event2, C1 holds as well (event3 is false, so the implication is true).
- Therefore C1 holds at the next state on every possible continuation, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true.
- C3 states ""C2 does not hold"", which is therefore false."

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
   - This requires event2 to hold in every state. The initial state is event3 (not event2), so C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds.""
   - In the initial state event3 does happen, so the antecedent is true; this requires C1 to hold. But C1 is false, so the implication is false (at the initial state).

4. Evaluate C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds.""
   - Interpreting these formulas as state properties evaluated at the initial state: event1 does not hold initially (initially event3), and C2 is false (step 3). Thus the disjunction is false.

Context timeline:
- Initially state0: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → state1: event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from state1 onward it stays event1 (state2, state3, ... all event1).
- The rule for event3 is irrelevant (event3 never occurs here).

- C2: ""if event1 happens then C1 holds"" (event1 -> X event2).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X (event1 -> X event2)).

Evaluate C3 at the initial state:
- C3 requires that in state1 the formula (event1 -> X event2) holds.
- In state1, event1 is true, so (event1 -> X event2) reduces to X event2 at state1.
- X event2 at state1 asks that state2 be event2. But after event1 no other events can happen, so state2 is event1, not event2. Thus X event2 at state1 is false.
- Therefore (event1 -> X event2) is false in state1, so X (event1 -> X event2) is false in the initial state.

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — means in every state event1 is true.
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" — means in every state C1 is true (equivalently, C1 holds globally).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future state (including the initial) C2 becomes true.

2. Examine the context and reachable states:
   - Initially event2 holds.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → from event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → from event1 it would stay at event1, but we never reach event1.
   - After event3, event2 must happen → from event3 you'd go to event2, but we never start at or reach event3.

3. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - C1 requires event1 in every state. The initial state has event2 (not event1), so C1 is false at the start and cannot become true later because the system stays at event2 forever.
   - Therefore C2 (C1 holding globally) cannot hold at any state.

4. Evaluate C3:
   - C3 says that at some future state C2 will hold. But C2 never holds in any reachable state, so C3 is false.

3. The initial state has event1 true.

Reasoning:
1. C1 = ""event2 eventually happens"" (F event2).
2. C2 = ""eventually C1"" = F(F event2), and F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 ≡ C1 (i.e. F event2).
3. C3 = ""C2 holds or event2 happens (now)"" = F event2 ∨ event2_now. Since event2_now implies F event2, C3 is equivalent to F event2 (event2 eventually happens).
4. From the initial state event1, the rules allow a transition directly to event3. Once at event3, no other events can happen, so event2 will never occur on that execution.

1. From the context: initial state has event2. The transition rules force a cycle 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> ...
2. So the immediate next state after the initial state is event1.

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens and Event1 happens"" (a conjunction requiring both hold in the same state).  
2. C2 is identical to C1.  
3. C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"", which is equivalent to C1 (since C1 = C2). So we only need to check whether there is a state where both event1 and event3 are true simultaneously.

4. From the context: initially event1 holds. After event1, either event2 or event3 happens. After event2 or event3, event1 happens. The system therefore moves between states where exactly one event is true at a time (events are mutually exclusive in a single state).

5. Because only one event can be true in any single state, no state can have both event1 and event3 true simultaneously. Thus C1 is never true, and so C2 is never true.

1. Context gives a cycle of mandatory next events: starting with event3, the next must be event2; after event2 the next must be event1; after event1 the next must be event3; and so on. So the states go: event3 (initial) → event2 → event1 → event3 → ...

5. Therefore C1 holds (and so does C2), which makes C3 true.

1. C1 = (event1 or event2).  
2. C2 = (event1 or event2) — identical to C1.  
3. C3 = C1 or C2, so C3 is equivalent to (event1 or event2).

4. The initial state has event3 true (and therefore event1 and event2 are false in the initial state).  
5. Thus (event1 or event2) is false in the initial state, so C1 and C2 are false, hence C3 is false.

(Note: although after the initial event3 one of event1 or event2 must occur in the next state, C3 as written has no temporal operator — it's evaluated at the current/initial state and is false.)

Context and transitions:
- Initially event3 is true.
- After event3, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event3 forever.
- (The rules about event1 and event2 don't affect this run because we start at event3 and can't leave.)

Hypotheses:

1. C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 is true exactly when C2 is false.
2. C2 is the implication: if C1 holds then event3 happens (i.e. C1 -> event3).
3. An implication is false only when its antecedent is true and its consequent is false.
4. C1 is ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" (a conjunction holding in the current state).
5. The context says: initially event3 happened, and after event3 no other events can happen — so the initial (and all reachable) state has event3 true and event1, event2 false.
6. Therefore C1 is false in the initial state (both event1 and event2 are false).

1. Expand the formulas:
   - C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., event1 holds in every state).
   - C2 = C1 OR event3.
   - C3 = event3 OR C2 = event3 OR (C1 OR event3) = C1 OR event3.

2. Examine the transition system:
   - Initially event1 holds.
   - After event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3.
   - If event2 happens, the system stays at event2 forever (no other events can happen).
   - If event3 happens, the next state must be event2, then stays at event2.
   - Only one event holds per state.

3. Is C1 true? No — event1 does not hold in all states (it holds initially but the next state is event2 or event3, so event1 is not always true). Thus C1 is false.

4. Is event3 true in the initial state? No — the initial state is event1, not event3. (Although event3 may occur along some runs, it is not true initially.)

5. Since C3 = C1 OR event3 and both disjuncts are false in the initial state, C3 is false.

From the context:
- Initially event1.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (non-deterministic choice).
- After event2 and after event3, no further events occur (both are terminal).

Reasoning:
1. From the initial state (event1), there is a permitted next state where event3 happens (because after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen).
2. Therefore there exists an execution in which event3 eventually happens, so C1 is true on that execution.
3. Because C1 can be true from the initial state, C2 (""event3 never happens"") does not hold at the initial state (it is not guaranteed).
4. C3 requires C2 to hold at every state; since C2 already fails at the initial state, C3 is false.

1. Context facts: initially event3 happened. After event1/2/3, no other events can happen — so once the system is in any event state it stays there and no new events occur. In particular, starting state is event3 and no transitions to event1 are possible.

2. C1 = (event3 AND event1). That requires event3 and event1 to be true in the same state. Given the context (initially event3 and no other events can happen), event1 never occurs in the same state as event3. So C1 is false (cannot hold).

3. C2 = (event3 OR C1). Since event3 is true in the initial state, C2 is true (regardless of C1).

2. Therefore the timeline is: time0 = event1, time1 = event2, and from time1 onward event2 holds at every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret C1 as the state formula (event3 → event1). This is false exactly in states where event3 is true and event1 is false. (Events are mutually exclusive, so whenever event3 holds in a state, event1 does not hold in that same state.)

2. C2 is ¬C1, so C2 holds in any state where event3 holds.

3. From the context: initially event1, and after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen. So there is a reachable next state where event3 happens.

4. In that reachable state event3 holds, so C2 holds there. Hence C2 holds at some future state.

5. Therefore C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true."

Reasoning:
1. C1 is ""if event1 then event3"", i.e. in a single state C1 = (not event1) or event3. In any state where event1 holds and events are exclusive, C1 is false (because event3 is false there).
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"".
3. Initially event3 holds. By the context, after event3 the next state must be event1.
4. Evaluate C2 in the initial state: C2 requires C1 to hold in the next state (which is the event1 state). But as noted in (1), in an event1 state C1 is false. So C2 is false in the initial state.
5. C3 is ""if event3 happens then C2 holds"". At the initial state event3 is true while C2 is false, so the implication fails there.

   - After event3 → event1 (irrelevant here because we never reach event3 given the initial and event1-loop).

3. From the initial event1 state, every next state must also be event1 (because after event1 no other events can happen). Thus event1 holds in all states along the trace; there is never a state with ¬event1.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2.
- From event2: next must be event1 or event3.
- From event3: next must be event1.
- From event1: no further events (event1 is terminal).

What the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (i.e., at some future state event1 holds)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Interpreted as: at the current state event1 is true, and also (separately) event1 eventually holds (which is trivially true if event1 holds now).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event3 happens."" That requires a single state where both C2 is true and event3 is true simultaneously.

Trace the possible executions from the initial event2:
- Path A: event2 → event1. Then event1 holds (terminal). C2 holds at that event1 state (event1 true and thus C1 true), but event3 does not hold there. So C3 is false in this path.
- Path B: event2 → event3 → event1. At the event3 state, event3 holds but event1 does not, so C2 does not hold there. Later at the event1 state C2 holds but event3 does not. So there is no single state where both C2 and event3 hold.

Because event1 and event3 cannot hold in the same state, there is no state where C2 and event3 are both true. Therefore C3 is False.

- From event1 the rules allow either event2 or event3 (1 -> {2,3}).
- From event2 the rules require event3 (2 -> 3).
- Consider the infinite trace that always chooses the 1 -> 3 option: 3,1,3,1,3,1,... This trace never contains event2.

   - In a state where event1 is true and event2 is false, C1 is false.
   - In a state where event1 is false (e.g., the event2 state), C1 is true (implication with false antecedent).

3. Evaluate C1 along the run:
   - At the initial state (event1): C1 is false.
   - At the next state (event2): C1 is true.
   - And this repeats: C1 is true in every event2 state, false in every event1 state.

4. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — this is true because C1 holds at the next state (and infinitely often thereafter).

5. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 does hold, C3 is false.

1. Context: Initially event2. After event2, event3 must happen. After event3, no other events can happen. (So the only possible trace from the initial state is: event2 -> event3 -> event3 -> ...)

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the trace above, event1 never occurs, so C1 is true.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — this is the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false (event1 does not happen in any reachable state).

1. Context: initially event1 is true. From event1 the system must go to either event2 or event3. From event2 it must go to event3. From event3 it stays at event3 (no other events occur).

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" That is false in the initial state (since event1 happens initially).

3. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreted statewise, C2 is the implication (event2 → not event1). Check all reachable states:

   - If the next state is event2: event2 is true there, and event1 is false in that state (events are exclusive), so not event1 is true → implication true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Initially event1 is true (event2 is false).
2. C1 = ""event3 in the next state"" — a property about the next state.
3. C2 = (if event3 happens then C1). At the initial state event3 is false, so the implication is true (false → anything is true).
4. C3 = (event2 happens) AND C2. At the initial state event2 is false, so the conjunction is false (even though C2 is true).
5. Therefore C3 is false. (Note: there are reachable states where event2 holds later, but C3 as written is not an ""eventually"" formula — evaluated where stated — so it is false.)"

- C1: (event3 and event3) ≡ event3 (so C1 holds exactly in states where event3 is true).
- C2: (event2 and C1) ≡ (event2 and event3) — requires event2 and event3 true in the same state.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens"" (there exists a future state where event2 holds).
2. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event2 does not eventually happen.""
3. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" — we must check C2 at the state immediately after the initial state.

4. Context: initially event3. After event3, event1 must happen. So the next state is event1.
5. From event1, the system may go to event2 or to event3. There is a valid transition from event1 directly to event2.
6. Therefore at the event1 state there exists a future (one-step) execution where event2 happens, so C1 is true at event1.
7. If C1 is true at event1 then C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false at event1.

1. From the context:

   - From event1 the next must be event3.
   - From event3 the next must be event1.
   - From event2 no other events can happen (event2 is a sink).

2. Therefore the only reachable states from the initial state are the infinite alternation event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ...; event2 is never reached.

1. C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a logical tautology (event3 -> event3) and therefore holds in every state (it is true whether event3 is true or false in that state).

2. The initial state is event2. By the obligations, the next state must be event1, then event2, then event1, … so the system alternates forever between event2 and event1.

3. There is no rule that allows a transition to event3 from either event1 or event2, so event3 can never occur in any future state.

4. Evaluate the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" This is never true (no transition to event3).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never becomes true, C2 is false at every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event3 is true.
2. C2 requires: (current state has event3) AND (next state has event1).
   - This could hold at the initial state if the choice after event3 is event1.
3. But C3 requires C2 to hold at every state along the execution (globally/always).
4. If at some state C2 holds, that state is event3 and the next state is event1.
5. In that next state (which is event1), C2 cannot hold because C2 requires the current state to be event3.

1. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every state C2 is true).
2. C2 is: Event3 happens or C1 holds.
3. C1 is: Event2 happens and event3 happens — interpreted as both true in the same state.
4. Only one event can be true in a single state, so C1 is impossible (always false).
5. Therefore C2 simplifies to just: Event3 holds (at the current state).
6. From the context: initially event2; after event2 → event3; after event3 → event2. So the trace is 2,3,2,3,... (alternating).
7. C2 (i.e., ""event3"") is false at the initial state (which is event2), so C2 does not hold at every state.
8. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False.

Step 2 — Use the context (transition rules):
- Initially event2 happens.
- From event2, next must be event1 or event3.
- From event3, event1 must happen.
- From event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — Examine possible runs from the initial state:
- If the choice is event2 → event1: at the state where event1 holds, event2 is not true now and, because event1 is terminal, event2 will never happen later. So C1 is false there, event2 is false there, hence C2 is false at that state.
- If the choice is event2 → event3 → event1: at the event3 state, event2 is not true now and will not happen later (since event3 forces event1 and then termination). So C2 is false at the event3 state (and also false at the subsequent event1 state).

Since there are reachable states (event3 and event1 states) where C2 is false, C2 does not hold at all times. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False.

1. Context summary: Initially event2 is true. After event2, no other events can happen — so the system remains at event2 forever. (Rules about event1↔event3 are irrelevant because event1 or event3 never occur from the initial state.)

2. Simplify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is equivalent to Event1.
   - C2: same as C1, so also equivalent to Event1.
   - C3: C1 holds and C2 holds, which is Event1 AND Event1, i.e. Event1.

3. Ask: Does Event1 ever hold? No — the system starts at event2 and cannot move to any other event, so Event1 never happens.

1. From the context and prior examples, exactly one event holds in each state and the ""after"" rules give a deterministic cycle:
   - Initially event3.
   - After event3 → event2.
   - After event2 → event1.
   - After event1 → event3.
   So the sequence of states is 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ... repeating.

2. C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens"" (event1 OR event3).

3. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" which is the negation of C1:
   - C2 ≡ NOT(event1 OR event3) ≡ (not event1) AND (not event3).
   - Since exactly one event holds each state, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 holds"".

4. C3 is ""C2 always holds"", i.e. event2 holds in every state.

5. But the actual trace contains states with event3 and event1 as well (initial state is event3), so event2 does not hold in every state. In particular, at the initial state event3 is true, so C2 is false there.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. C2 = NOT C1 = (NOT event2) AND (NOT event1).
3. C3 = event1 AND C2 = event1 AND (NOT event1) AND (NOT event2) — this contains the contradiction event1 AND NOT event1, so C3 is logically impossible in any single state.
4. Checking with the context: initially event2 is true (so C1 holds and C2 is false). The system may later visit event1 or event3, but:
   - In an event1 state, event1 is true so C2 (which requires NOT event1) is false.
   - In an event3 state, C2 is true (neither event1 nor event2), but event1 is false there.
5. Therefore there is no state where both event1 and C2 hold simultaneously.

1. Timeline from the context:

   - After event1, no other events can happen → once at event1, the system stays at event1 forever.
   - After event3, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event3 is never reached).

2. Only one event can hold in any single state, and the reachable states are: initial state (event2), then event1 forever. Event3 never occurs on any path.

3. C1 = (event3 AND event1). That requires event3 and event1 to hold simultaneously in a state. That never happens (states have at most one event, and event3 never occurs), so C1 is always false.

4. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" is therefore always false.

1. We evaluate C3 at the initial state. C3 is (C2 holds) OR (event1 happens).

3. C1 is ""event3 eventually happens.""

5. At the initial state s0, C1 is true (event3 holds now), but C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state s1. From s1 onward, event3 never occurs, so C1 is false in s1. Thus C2 is false at the initial state.

1. From the context we have the unique allowed execution: initial state event3, then event2 must occur, and after event2 no other events can happen — so the trace is: event3 -> event2 -> event2 -> event2 -> ... (event2 holds from the second state onward forever).
2. Evaluate C1: ""Event3 always happens."" That would require event3 to hold in every state. But the trace has event2 in the second and all later states, so event3 is not always true. Therefore C1 is False.
3. Evaluate C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires C1 to be true. Since C1 is False, C2 is False (the conjunction fails).
4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This is just C2 ∧ event2; since C2 is False, C3 is False.

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens and Event3 happens"" — equivalent to just ""Event3 happens"" in the current state. C2 is identical to C1. C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", which is therefore equivalent to ""Event3 happens"" (in the current state).

2. The initial state is given as ""Initially, event1 happened."" So in the initial state event1 is true and event3 is false.

3. The context rules (after event1 → event2 must happen; after event2 → event1 or event3; after event3 → terminal) allow event3 to occur later along some executions, but C1/C2/C3 as written have no ""eventually"" operator — they require event3 to hold in the (current) state being evaluated.

1. Initial condition: event3 happened (true in the initial state).
2. Rule: After event3, no other events can happen. So from the initial state the system stays at event3 forever; event1 and event2 can never occur at any later time.
3. C1 = (event1 AND event2). That requires event1 and event2 to be true simultaneously in some state. Given step 2, neither event1 nor event2 can ever occur, so C1 can never be true.

5. From the context the transitions are:

   - C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" = ¬event3 (holds in a state iff that state is not event3).
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1 = event3 (holds in a state iff that state is event3).
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = next(event3) (the next state must be event3).

2. Look at the context and initial state:
   - Initially event2.
   - From event2, the next state must be either event1 or event3 (nondeterministic choice).

3. Evaluate C3 at the initial state:
   - C3 would be true at the initial state only if the next state is guaranteed to be event3.
   - But the rules allow the next state from event2 to be event1 as well, so event3 is not guaranteed.

4. Therefore C3 is not necessarily true (it can be false if the choice goes to event1).

1. From the context: initially event2. After event2, event3 must happen. After event3, event2 must happen. So the only allowed sequence (starting from the initial state) is an infinite alternation: event2, event3, event2, event3, ...

2. Event1 never occurs in that sequence (no rule allows moving to event1 from event2 or event3), so event1 is unreachable.

3. C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — this would require every state to be event3. But the sequence alternates 2,3,2,3,..., so C1 is false (event3 does not hold at the states where event2 occurs).

4. C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — at an event2 state (e.g. the initial state) neither C1 holds nor does event1 happen, so C2 is false at that state.

5. C3: ""C2 always holds"" — because C2 is false at the initial state, C3 is false.

2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ¬C1. Thus C2 holds exactly in state event2 (where C1 is false) and fails in states event1 and event3.

3. C3 is ""C2 holds and event3 happens"" i.e. (¬C1) ∧ event3. That would require a state where both event2 (since ¬C1 ⇔ being in event2) and event3 hold simultaneously. But exactly one event holds per state, so no state can satisfy both event2 and event3.

4. In particular, the initial state is event3, where C1 is true and so C2 is false; therefore C3 is false at the initial state. There is no other state in which both C2 and event3 are true.

1. C1 = ""Event2 always happens"" means event2 must be true in every state (globally).
2. In the initial state event1 is true, so event2 is false there. Therefore C1 is false in the initial state.
3. Could C1 become true at some later state (so C2 = ""eventually C1"" might hold)? For C1 to hold at some state s, event2 would have to be true at s and at every subsequent state.
4. But the rules say: after event2, event1 must happen. So immediately after any state with event2, the next state is event1 (not event2). Hence it is impossible for event2 to hold in every future state once you are at a state with event2.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initial state = event1. From event1 the only possible next is event3; from event3 the only possible next is event1. So the reachable trace alternates: event1, event3, event1, event3, ...

2. C1 = ""event3 eventually happens."" From the initial state this is true (event3 occurs at the next state). Also C1 is true at the next state (event3 holds immediately there).

3. C2 = ""if C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a state formula: it requires that whenever ""event3 eventually happens"" holds at that state, event1 must hold at that same state.

4. At the initial state: C1 is true and event1 is true, so C2 is true at the initial state.

5. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must evaluate C2 at the next state (the state where event3 holds). At that next state C1 is true (event3 happens immediately) but event1 is false, so the implication C1 -> event1 is false there. Thus C2 is false in the next state.

1. Initial state s0: event3 is true. C3 at s0 is ""event1 holds now OR C2 holds now"".
2. event1 does not hold now (s0 has event3), so we need to check C2 at s0.
3. C2 is ""eventually C1"", where C1 is ""event1 holds in the next state"" (next(event1)). So C2 means: at some future state t, the next state t+1 has event1 — equivalently, event1 occurs at some future step.
4. From event3, the rules allow either event1 or event2 next. So there are two possible behaviors:
   - If the choice is event1 from s0, then event1 does occur and C2 (and C1) become true.
   - But the rules also allow choosing event2 from s0. From event2 the system must go to event3, and from that event3 we may again choose event2. Thus there is a valid infinite run 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... in which event1 never occurs.
5. Along that run, C2 is false (event1 never happens), and event1 is false at s0, so C3 is false at s0.
6. Because the context permits a run where C3 is false, C3 is not guaranteed true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Events per state: as in the examples, exactly one event holds in each state. Initial state: event2.

2. Transition rules:
   - After event2 → next is event1.
   - After event1 → next is event2.
   - After event3 → next is event2.
   With initial event2 and no rule producing event3, reachable states alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3. Analyze the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to just ""event2 happens."" So C1 holds in every state where event2 holds (in particular the initial state).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since event2 holds at the initial state and recurs, C2 is true.
   - C3: ""C2 holds and event3 happens"" — this requires both that C2 is true and that event3 holds (in the relevant state). Although C2 is true, event3 never occurs in any reachable state (no transition leads to event3). Therefore event3 is false, so the conjunction C3 is false.

1. The context fixes the trace: start at event2, then (must) go to event3, and from event3 no other events can happen — so the trace is event2 -> event3 -> event3 -> event3 -> ...
2. C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., event2 holds at every state).
3. In the trace, event2 holds at the initial state but not at the subsequent states (which are event3), so C1 is false.
4. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — there must be some future state from which event2 holds at every state thereafter.
5. No such future state exists: after the initial state we are in event3 forever, and event2 never holds thereafter, so C1 never becomes true at any state.

1. From the context, the reachable states form a loop: initially event1, then (after event1) event3, then (after event3) event1, and so on — the system alternates 1,3,1,3,... Event2 is never reached because no rule allows moving to event2 from the reachable states.

2. C1 is the formula ""if event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (event3 → event3). This is a tautology (always true) in every state.

3. C2 is ""event2 happens and C1 holds"". Since C1 holds everywhere, C2 reduces to requiring event2 to hold in the current state. But event2 never occurs in any reachable state, so C2 is always false.

4. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., some future state contains event2. Because event2 never occurs, C2 never holds, so C3 is false.

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and Event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to Event2.  
2. C2 is ""C1 holds or Event2 happens"" — substituting C1 gives ""Event2 or Event2"", which is again just Event2.  
3. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — that is, ""always Event2"".

Now check the system behavior:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state is event1).
- Therefore there is a state (the next state) where event2 is false (event1 is true).

Since C2 (which is just Event2) does not hold in that next state, it is not true in all states. Therefore C3 (""always Event2"") is false.

1. C1 is: event3 happens or event1 happens.

3. C3 is: If C2 holds, then event3 happens. Interpreted at the same state, C3 is the implication (C2 → event3).

1. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" In the initial state event1 already happened, so C1 is true at the initial state.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., at every state, event1 eventually happens.
   - From event1: event1 already holds (or happens now).
   - From event2: the next state is either event1 or event3; if event3 occurs it forces event1 next, so within at most two steps event1 will occur.
   - From event3: the next state must be event1.
   Thus from every reachable state event1 happens within at most two transitions, so C1 holds at every state. Therefore C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 holds and event3 happens."" We have shown C2 is true. But in the initial state event3 is not true (initially event1 happened). Since the conjunct ""event3 happens"" is false in the initial state, the conjunction C3 is false.

1. Context summary:
   - Initial state: event2 holds.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event2 forever).
   - The rules about event1↔event3 are irrelevant because we never reach event1 or event3.

2. Interpret the hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., event3 holds in every state).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point, event3 holds in every state from then on).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, it is true that eventually event3 will hold always).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - In the initial state event2 holds, not event3. So event3 does not hold always.
   - Therefore C1 is false.

4. Evaluate C2:
   - From the initial state the system stays at event2 forever, so event3 never appears; there is no future point from which event3 holds in all states.

Reasoning:
- Initial state: event1 happened.
- After event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3.
- C2 is ""event1 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 = ""event3 eventually happens"".
- In any next state, event1 is false (only one event per state), so C2 at the next state reduces to C1 at that next state.
- If the next state is event3, then C1 is true (event3 has occurred), so C2 is true there.
- If the next state is event2, then after event2 no other events can happen, so event3 will never occur and C1 is false, hence C2 is false there.
- Because there is a possible next state (event2) where C2 does not hold, C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed.

1. From the context:
   - Time0: event3 holds (initially).
   - After event3, event2 must happen → Time1: event2.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → from Time1 onward it stays event2 forever.

2. Evaluate C1 (""event3 happens in the next state""):
   - At Time0 (event3), the next state (Time1) is event2, so C1 is false at Time0.
   - At Time1 and all later times (event2), the next state is event2, so C1 is false at every later time as well.
   - Conclusion: C1 never holds at any state.

3. Evaluate C2 (""C1 always holds""):
   - Since C1 is false at Time0 (and everywhere), C2 is false at every state.

4. Evaluate C3 (""C2 eventually holds""):
   - There is no future state at which C2 becomes true (C2 is always false), so C3 is false.

1. Identify the statements:
   - C1: Event3 eventually happens (at some future time).
   - C2: C1 always holds (in every state, event3 will eventually happen).
   - C3: C2 eventually holds (there is some future state from which, in every subsequent state, event3 will eventually happen).

2. Use the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen — so once in the initial state event2, the system remains at event2 forever (no transitions to event1 or event3).
   - The other rules (after event1 → event2, after event3 → event1) are irrelevant because event1 and event3 never occur.

3. Evaluate C1: Since the system is stuck at event2 and no other events can occur, event3 never happens. So C1 is false (does not hold) at the initial state and at all times.

4. Evaluate C2: C2 requires that C1 hold in every state. Because C1 is false at the initial state, C2 is false.

5. Evaluate C3: C3 requires that at some future state C2 becomes true. But the system never leaves the initial event2 state, so C2 never becomes true. Therefore C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event1 is true.
2. From event1, event2 must happen next. So C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true at the initial state (event2 happens immediately).
3. C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state is event2. From event2 the system either goes to event1 or to event3. In either case event2 will occur again later (2->1->2 or 2->3->1->2), so C1 holds at that next state. Therefore C2 is true at the initial state.
4. C3 is ""event3 happens AND C2 holds"" evaluated at the initial state. Although C2 holds, the initial state has event1, not event3. So the conjunct ""event3 happens"" is false.
5. Since one conjunct is false, C3 is false.

Thus C3 is False."

2. Therefore C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is true (event3 holds in every state).
3. C2 is the implication: if C1 holds then event2 happens. Since C1 is true, C2 requires that event2 hold in the current state — i.e., C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
2. C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the context, initially event1 happened and after event1, event3 must happen — so the next state is event3. Therefore C1 is false at the initial state.
3. C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true at the initial state (because C1 is false).
4. Since C2 holds, C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

Thus the final answer is False."

3. Evaluate C2 at the initial state: ""C1 holds or event2 happens.""
   - Although C1 is false, event2 does happen in the initial state. Therefore C2 is true at the initial state.

4. C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 holds at the initial state, C3 is false.

3. Observe C2 can only be true in states labeled event1 whose next state is event2. C2 is false in any state labeled event2 or event3 (since it requires event1 now), and C2 is false in an event1 state if the chosen next state is event3.

4. From the initial event1 state, the next state may be event3. If that choice happens, then at the initial state C1 is false (next is not event2), so C2 is false at that state. Therefore C2 does not hold in all states of that execution, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

1. C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So we must check whether C2 is true in the state immediately after the initial state.
2. C2 is: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., C1 must be true in every state.
3. C1 is: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both simultaneously in the same state).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" = there is some future state whose next state is event1.
- C3: ""Eventually C2 holds"" = at some future state there is (further) a state whose next is event1.

Transitions: from event3 the next must be either event1 or event2 (choice). From event1 next must be event2. From event2 next must be event3.

Consider the run that always picks event2 when leaving event3:
event3 -> event2 -> event3 -> event2 -> ...
- In this run, the successor of every event3 is event2, never event1. Thus C1 never holds at any state.
- Therefore C2 is false at every state (there is never a future state whose successor is event1).
- Hence C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the transitions are forced:
   - initial state: event3.
   - after event3 → event1.
   - after event1 → event2.
   - after event2 → event1.
   So the run is: state0: event3, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, state4: event2, ... (1 and 2 alternate after the first step).

2. C1 = (event2 → event3) evaluated per state:
   - In any state where event2 is true, event3 is false (only one event holds per state), so C1 is false in event2 states.
   - In states with event1 or event3, event2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true there.

3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state.""
   - From the initial state (event3), the next state is event1. C1 is true in the event1 state (see 2), so C2 is true in the initial state.
   - But in the event1 state, the next state is event2, where C1 is false, so C2 is false in the event1 state.

4. C3 = (event1 AND C2) evaluated at a state:
   - At the initial state (event3), event1 is false, so C3 is false there.
   - At state1 (event1), event1 is true but C2 is false there (see 3), so C3 is false.
   - At event2 states event1 is false, so C3 is false.

5. Therefore C3 is never satisfied in this run. So the hypothesis C3 is False."

1. The context enforces a single deterministic sequence of events:
   - State0 (initial): event3.
   - After event3 → event1 (State1).
   - After event1 → event2 (State2).
   - After event2 → event1 (State3).
   - Then it alternates event1, event2 forever.

2. C1 = (event1 AND event3) — requires event1 and event3 to be true in the same state. In the sequence above, event3 occurs only in the initial state, and event1 occurs only in later states; there is no state where both are true simultaneously. So C1 is always false.

1. Goal: decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

2. Break down formulas:
   - C1: If event2 happens then event1 happens. As a state formula this is (not event2) OR event1.
   - C2: C1 holds AND event3 holds.
   - C3: C2 holds in every state along the execution (always C2).

3. Use the context (transitions):
   - Initially event3 is true.
   - After event3, event1 must happen (so next state is event1).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 forever).
   - event2 is never reached in this sequence.

4. Evaluate C1 and C2 on the states:
   - Initial state (event3): event2 is false, so C1 is true (implication holds vacuously). event3 is true, so C2 is true in the initial state.
   - Next state (event1): event2 is false, so C1 is still true. But event3 is false, so C2 is false in this state.

5. Since C2 is not true in all states (it fails at the event1 state), C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

1. C1 = ""Event3 always happens"" — i.e., in the current state and every future state, event3 is true.
2. From the context: initially event3 happened. But after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. So there is no transition from event3 to event3; event3 cannot hold in two consecutive states.

1. From the context, the only allowed sequence of events is:
   - state0: event3 (initially),
   - state1: event2 (after event3, event2 must happen),
   - state2: event1 (after event2, event1 must happen),
   - state3 onward: event1 (after event1 no other events can happen, so it stays at event1).

2. ""Event2 always happens"" means event2 must be true in every state (i.e., at all times).  
   - In the trace above, event2 is true only at state1, not at state0 (event3) and not at state2 or later (event1 holds then).  
   - Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" is false.

3. C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" → False.

1. Initially event1 is true (initial state = event1).
2. The rules say:
   - After event1, event3 must happen (so next state after event1 is event3).
   - After event3, event1 must happen (so next state after event3 is event1).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant unless event2 is reached).
3. From the initial event1, the system must go to event3, then back to event1, and so on. Thus the only events that ever occur are event1 and event3, alternating forever. Event2 is never reached.
4. C1 is ""event1 or event3"". Given the alternating behavior, C1 is true in every state.

- Therefore in the next state event3 does not happen, so C2 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. We treat event1, event2, event3 as propositional facts about a single state (as in the examples): in any state exactly one of the events holds.
2. Initially event2 holds.
3. From event2 the next state must be either event1 or event3.
4. From event1 the next state must be event2; from event3 the next state must be event2. Thus the system alternates between event2 and either event1 or event3.
5. C1 is ""event1 and event3"" — that requires event1 and event3 to hold simultaneously in the same state.
6. Because only one event can hold in a state, C1 is never true (unsatisfiable).
7. C2 is ""C1 and event3"" so C2 is also never true.
8. Therefore C2 never holds at any time, so ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is false.

Hence C3 is False."

1. Initial state: event2 happened.
2. From the rules: after event2 must come event3, and after event3 must come event2. So the system alternates forever between event2 and event3; event1 never occurs in any reachable state.
3. C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state."" At the initial state (event2), the next state is event3, so C1 is true initially. More generally, C1 is true exactly in states where the current event is event2.
4. C2 = ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" At the initial state (event2), event2 is true, so C2 is true. In fact C2 is true in the event2 states and false in the event3 states.
5. C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" At the initial state C2 holds but event1 does not (only event2 is true). Since the antecedent is true and the consequent false, the implication is false.
6. Because event1 never occurs along any reachable trace, whenever C2 holds (in event2 states) the implication fails. Therefore C3 is false.

1. From the context we follow the same single-event-per-state assumption as in the examples: in any state exactly one of event1, event2, event3 holds.
2. C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" ≡ not event3.
3. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" ≡ event1 and not event3. Given exclusivity, this is equivalent to just event1.
4. So C2 holds exactly in states where event1 is true. The initial state has event1 true, so C2 holds in the initial state.
5. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" is the state implication (C2 → event2). Since C2 ≡ event1, this is equivalent to (event1 → event2).

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., in the current and every future state event2 holds (global/always event2).
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the next state, event2 holds in that state and all future states.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" — in every state, C1 holds in the next state.

2. Use the context:
   - Initial state: event1.
   - From event1 the next state must be event3.
   - From event3 the next state is either event1 or event2.
   - From event2 the next state must be event1.

3. Evaluate C1:
   - C1 would require every state to be event2. But the initial state is event1, so C1 is false already at the initial state.
   - More generally, because after event2 the next state must be event1, you can never have event2 hold in every future state starting at any point. So C1 is impossible anywhere.

4. Evaluate C2 and C3:
   - Since C1 cannot hold in any state, C2 (""C1 in the next state"") is false in every state.
   - Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false as well.

- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (same requirement reiterated).

From the context: initial is event1, and after event1 the next must be event2 — so C1 holds at the initial state. But after event2 the next may be event1 or event3. Take the allowed trace: event1 → event2 → event1 → ... . At the state where the current event is event2 and the chosen next event is event1, C1 is false (the next event is not event2).

Reasoning (step by step):

3. C3 = (event3) AND C2 = event3 AND (NOT event1) AND (NOT event3).
4. That conjunction contains both event3 and NOT event3, a logical contradiction, so C3 is impossible in any state.
5. Contextual trace (for completeness): starting from initial event2, the system moves to event1 or event3; states where C2 holds are exactly the event2 states, but C3 would require event3 and NOT event3 simultaneously, which cannot occur.

1. Interpret the context as a transition system on states labeled by which single event happened:
   - Initial state: event3 is true.
   - From event3 the next state must be event1.
   - From event1 the next state is either event2 or event3.
   - From event2 the next state is either event1 or event3.
   (Only one event proposition is true in any given state.)

2. Understand the formulas (all interpreted as state propositions unless a temporal operator is explicit):
   - C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" As a state formula this is (event3 → event2).
   - C2: C1 holds and event1 happens = (C1 ∧ event1).
   - C3: C2 always holds (i.e., in every state C2 is true).

3. Evaluate C1 in the initial state:
   - In the initial state event3 is true and event2 is false (only one event can be true), so (event3 → event2) is false in the initial state. Thus C1 is false initially.

4. Since C1 is false in the initial state, C2 = (C1 ∧ event1) is false in that state (and in particular not true there).

5. C3 requires C2 to hold in every state. Because C2 is already false in the initial state, C3 cannot be true.

3. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. at every state, the next state has Event3 true (so from every state the next state must be event3).

Reasoning:
1. Interpret formulas: C1 = F(event3). C2 = F(C1) which is equivalent to F(event3). C3 = G(C2) which is equivalent to G F(event3) — i.e. ""event3 occurs infinitely often"" (from every state there is a future event3).
2. System transitions: e3 -> e2 (forced), e2 -> {e1,e3}, e1 -> {e2,e3}. Start at e3.
3. There is a valid trace that avoids event3 after the initial state: e3 (initial), e2, e1, e2, e1, e2, ... alternating e1 and e2 forever by always choosing e2->e1 and e1->e2 choices, never taking the edges to e3.
4. Along that trace, after the initial state there is no future event3, so at those states F(event3) is false. Hence C2 is false at those states and C3 = G(C2) is violated.
5. Therefore C3 does not hold in the system.

- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true at every reachable state: from event1 it happens next, and at event2 it already holds.
- C2 is the proposition (if C1 then event2). Since C1 is true in every reachable state, C2 requires event2 to be true in every reachable state.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. From the context: the initial state has event2. After event2 the next state must be event1. After event1 the next state is either event2 or event3. After event3 the next state must be event1. Thus possible runs are e2, e1, e2, e1, ... or e2, e1, e3, e1, e2, e1, ...
2. In these problems a single event holds in each state, so no state can have both event2 and event1 true simultaneously.
3. C1 is (event2 AND event1) in the same state — this can never be true, so C1 is always false.
4. C2 is (event1 AND C1). Since C1 is always false, C2 is always false.
5. C3 is “eventually C2 holds.” Because C2 never holds, C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. As in the examples, events are mutually exclusive per state, so a conjunction ""Event3 happens and Event1 happens"" requires both to hold in the same state.

2. C1 is ""Event3 happens and Event1 happens"" — that requires a single state where both event3 and event1 are true. That is impossible because only one event can be true in a state.

3. Therefore C1 is never true in any state.

4. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 never holds, C2 is false in every state.

5. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — since C2 never holds, C3 is false.

1. Context: initially event1. After event1 → event3 must happen. After event3 → event1 must happen. So from the initial state the system is forced to alternate event1 → event3 → event1 → ... forever.

1. Interpret the context:
   - Initial state: event2 is true.
   - From event2, the next state must be event1.
   - From event1, no other events can happen (event1 holds in that state and it is terminal).
   - The ""after event3"" rule is irrelevant here because event3 doesn't occur on the path from the initial state.

   - C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" = (¬X(event2)) → event1 (where event1 is evaluated in the current state).

2. The context says initially event3 happened, so there is a state (the initial state) where event3 is true.

3. In that initial state, C1 (not event3) is false, and event1 is false, so C2 is false in the initial state.

1. Context and transitions:
   - Initially event3 holds.
   - After event3, event2 must happen (so the next state is event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen — meaning once at event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
   - (The rule after event1 → event3 is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs in the actual run.)

2. Build the actual trace:
   - State0: event3 (initial)
   - State1: event2 (forced by after event3)
   - State2, State3, ...: event2 (stays at event2 forever)

3. Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens"" (redundant disjunction).
2. C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" therefore is ""Event2 happens AND Event1 happens"" — both must be true in the same state.
3. By the model of these problems (as in the examples), each state is characterized by a single event having happened, so two different events cannot be true simultaneously in one state.
4. Therefore C2 is impossible to satisfy in any state (Event1 and Event2 cannot hold at the same time).
5. If C2 never holds, then ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is false.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. event1 holds in every state). In the trace, event1 is true only in the initial state; later states are event3 and event2. So C1 is false.

   - From event1 the next state is either event2 or event3.
   - From event2 the next state is event1.

- From event2, the next can be event1 or event3 (non-deterministic).

- Choose the non-deterministic option from event2 to go back to event1. Then the trace is 1,2,1,2,1,... forever.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1 holds.
- Transitions:
  - After event1 -> event3 (must).
  - After event3 -> event1 or event2 (one of them).
  - After event2 -> event3 (must).

Hypothesis:
- C1: event3 does not happen (¬event3).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (next-state ¬event3).
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens (event2 ∧ next-state ¬event3).

Reasoning:
1. C3 can only be true in a state where event2 holds (because it includes event2).
2. But the transition rule after event2 requires that the next state is event3. Therefore in any state where event2 holds, the next state has event3 true, so ¬event3 is false in that next state.
3. Thus C2 (next-state ¬event3) is false in every state where event2 holds.
4. Therefore C3 = (event2 ∧ C2) is false in every state.

1. From the context we have a deterministic cycle: initially event3, then event2, then event1, then event3, ... repeating forever (3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ...). Exactly one event holds in each state and the three events repeat cyclically.

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is true in states where event2 is not the current event (i.e., in the event3 and event1 states) and false in the states where event2 occurs.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is simply ¬C1, which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens."" So C2 holds exactly in the states where event2 is the current event.

Reasoning (step by step):

1. From the context: initial state = event3. After event3, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen (so it stays at event2 forever). After event1, event3 must happen — but event1 never occurs in the actual run starting from the initial state.

2. Interpret the hypothesis as state formulas (as in the examples):
   - C1: (event1 → event2) holds in the current state.
   - C2: event2 ∧ C1 holds in the current state.
   - C3: C2 ∧ event3 holds in the current state (i.e., event2 ∧ C1 ∧ event3).

3. C3 therefore requires a single state where event2 and event3 are both true simultaneously. But events are exclusive (only one event holds in a state), and the system never has event2 and event3 true in the same state.

4. Hence C3 cannot be satisfied in any state of the run. Therefore C3 is False."

Context summary:
- Initially event2.
- After event2 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → event2 must happen.
- After event3 → event2 must happen (irrelevant because event3 is never reachable here).

From the context the only reachable behavior is an alternating cycle: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

Evaluate the formulas:

1. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., G event1).  
   - This requires event1 to hold in every state. But the trace contains states where event2 holds (initial state and every other state). So C1 is false at every state.

2. C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" = event2 ∨ C1.  
   - Since C1 is false everywhere, C2 reduces to just event2. Thus C2 is true in event2 states and false in event1 states.

3. C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., G C2).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 means ""event2 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 is false in a state).
2. C2 means ""C1 holds in the next state"" — equivalently, in the next state event2 is false.
3. C3 is ""event2 happens now AND C2 holds"" — i.e., event2 is true now and event2 is false in the next state.
4. From the context, the initial state is event3 (so event2 is false now).
5. Therefore at the initial state the conjunct ""event2 happens now"" is false, so C3 is false at the initial state.
(For completeness: whenever event2 does occur in some state, the transition rules force the next state to be event1 or event3, so C2 would hold then; but that doesn't make C3 true at the initial state.)"

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1 is the proposition (event3 -> event2), i.e. in any single state if event3 holds then event2 must also hold in that same state.
2. Only one event holds in a state, so whenever event3 holds in a state, event2 does not hold in that same state. Thus C1 is false in any state where event3 occurs.
3. From the context, initially event1, and after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen. So there is a reachable state with event3 (choose the event1→event3 branch).
4. Since a reachable state has event3, C1 is false in that state. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
5. C3 is ""C2 holds or event3 happens"". At the initial state event3 does not hold (initially event1), and we just established C2 is false.
6. Therefore C3 is false."

   - At that state event2 is true, so to satisfy C2 at that state we would need C1 to be true there (i.e., from event2 the next state would have to be event3).
   - But from event2 the context requires the next state be event1, not event3. So C1 is false at the event2 state, hence C2 is false at that state.
   - Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

1. C1 is ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event3 in a state).
2. C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" = (¬event3) ∧ event3.
3. (¬event3) ∧ event3 is a logical contradiction; it can never be true in any single state.

Interpretation: a property like ""C2 always holds"" must hold on every possible future state of every possible allowed execution.

1. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true at the initial state because event1 holds immediately.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. at every future state, event1 will eventually occur. This fails: from event2 one can choose event3, and from event3 you return to event2, and one can loop event2 -> event3 -> event2 -> ... forever, never choosing event1. Concretely, starting event1, then event2, then repeatedly event3,event2,... produces states (event2 or event3) from which event1 never occurs. So there exist reachable states where ""event1 eventually happens"" is false. Therefore C2 is false.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state after the initial event1 is event2. Since C2 is false at that state (as shown above, from that event2 you can avoid event1 forever), C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 = (event1 AND event1) which simplifies to event1.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Only one event can hold in a single state (events are mutually exclusive).
2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — a property about the next-state.
3. C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" — so in the same state we must have event3 true and the next state must be event2. This is possible (e.g., when we are in an event3 state and the next transition goes to event2).
4. C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" — this requires, in the same state, event1 and event3 both to be true (because C2 already requires event3 in that state). But that is impossible by (1).
5. Therefore C3 can never hold in any state.

So C3 is False."

1. Interpret the system as states labelled by which single event holds in that state. Initial state: event2.

2. Transition rules:
   - From event1: next must be event3.
   - From event2: next must be event1 or event3.
   - From event3: next must be event1 or event2.

3. C1 is ""event3 always happens"" (G event3): that would require a state from which every future state has event3 (in particular, the current state must be event3 and every subsequent state too).

4. From the transitions, there is no self-loop on event3: if you are in event3 the next state must be event1 or event2, so you cannot have two consecutive event3 states, and you cannot reach a suffix where every state is event3. Hence G event3 is false at every state (it fails immediately whenever the current state is not event3, and even at a state that is event3 it fails because the next state cannot be event3).

5. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). Since C1 never holds at any state, C2 is false.

6. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). Because C2 is false at every state, X C2 is false in the initial state.

Therefore C3 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state s0: event2.
2. From event2 the rules allow next state s1 to be event3 (since after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen).
3. If s1 = event3, then by the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"", all future states s1, s2, ... are event3.
4. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false on that trace because event1 never occurs (states are event2 then event3 forever).
5. C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is false at s0 because in s1 C1 does not hold.
6. C3 (""C2 always holds"") therefore fails (it is not true at s0).
7. Because the context allows the trace s0=event2, s1=event3,..., C3 is not guaranteed.

Thus C3 is False."

1. Context timeline: initially event2. After event2, event3 must happen. After event3, no other events can happen (so it stays event3 forever). After event1, no other events can happen (not relevant here because we never reach event1).

2. So the actual sequence of states is:
   - s0: event2 (initial)
   - s1: event3 (must follow s0)
   - s2, s3, ...: event3 (stays at event3)

3. C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state."" Evaluate C1 at s0: the next state s1 is event3, so C1 is true at s0.

4. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1. Since C1 is true at s0, C2 is false at s0.

5. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" means C2 must be true in every state. But C2 is false at the initial state s0, so C3 is false.

1. From the context we have a deterministic cycle of states: initial state = event3, then event2, then event1, then event3, … (3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...). Only one event holds in any single state.

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" Evaluate in both reachable states:
   - In state event2: C1 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).

1. C1 is ""event3 and event2"". C2 is identical to C1. C3 is C1 and C2, so C3 is equivalent to ""event3 and event2"" (both must hold, but they are the same condition).

2. The context says ""Initially, event3 happened."" So in the initial state event3 = true and event2 = false.

3. C1 requires event2 to be true in the same state as event3. That is not satisfied in the initial state.

4. The transition rules (after event2 → event3, after event3 → event1 or event2, after event1 → event2) describe states labeled by a single event; there is no state where event2 and event3 hold simultaneously. Thus C1 (and hence C2) is never true in any state.

5. Therefore C3 is false.

1. Simplify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to Event1.
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" becomes (Event1) OR (Event2).
   - C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" is Event2 AND (Event1 OR Event2), which simplifies to Event2.

2. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event3 happened.
   - After event3, no other events can happen → the system stays at event3 forever (no transitions out).
   - Therefore event2 never occurs in any reachable state.

3. Since C3 is equivalent to ""Event2"" and event2 never happens, C3 is never true.

1. Restate the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., in every state, event2 holds).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (at some future point, from then on C1 is true).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (at some future point, C2 becomes true).

2. Use the context:
   - Initially event2 is true.
   - After event2, event3 must happen (so the next state after any event2 is event3).
   - After event3, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event3 forever).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - C1 requires event2 to hold in every state. But starting at initial event2, the next state is event3 (so event2 is false there). Therefore C1 is false (it does not hold globally).

4. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 would require that at some future point C1 becomes true forever. That would mean there is a state from which every subsequent state has event2 true.
   - But whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event3, and from event3 nothing else can happen, so there is no future point after which event2 holds in every state. Thus C2 is false.

5. Evaluate C3:
   - C3 requires that C2 holds at some future point. Since C2 is never true, C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Start state: event3 happened.
2. Transition rules force: after event3, event2 must happen; after event2, event3 must happen. So the only possible infinite trace from the initial state is the alternation 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ...
3. There is no rule allowing event1 to occur after any state (the rule ""after event1 ..."" only constrains what must follow event1, it does not enable event1 to ever occur). Therefore event1 never happens on any reachable state.
4. C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.
5. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is equivalent to C1 (event1 occurs at some point), so C2 is also false.
6. C3 (""C2 always holds"") requires C2 to hold at every state; since C2 is false, C3 is false.

Thus C3 is False."

1. Interpret the context (as in the examples): exactly one event holds in each state. Initially event2 holds. From event2 the next state must be event1. From event1 no other events can happen, i.e. once we reach event1 it stays event1 forever. (Similarly, after event3 we would go to event1, but event3 never occurs here.)

2. So the timeline is: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, state2 = event1, ... (event1 forever after state1).

3. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — a conjunction that requires both event1 and event2 to hold in the same state. Given exactly one event holds per state, no single state can have both event1 and event2 true simultaneously. Therefore C1 is false in every state.

4. C2 is ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false everywhere, C2 is false.

5. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 never holds in any state, C3 is false.

So the only runs are:

2. From the context:

3. Could C1 ever be true?
   - C1 requires event1 and event2 to be true simultaneously in a single state.
   - As in the context we never leave event3, and in any case events 1 and 2 are distinct events that cannot both hold simultaneously, so C1 is impossible.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - There is no rule that introduces event3 from this starting point, so event3 never occurs on this trace.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state (event1), the next state is event2, so C1 is false at the initial state.

3. C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event3 to hold in the same state and C1 to hold. Since event3 never occurs and C1 is false, C2 is false in every relevant state.

Context facts:
- Initially event3 holds.
- After event3, no other events can happen — so once in an event3 state the system stays at event3 forever (no transition to event1 or event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here since event1 never occurs).
- After event2, event3 must happen (irrelevant because we never leave event3).

Hypothesis breakdown:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""

Trace:
1. The system starts in event3.
2. From event3 no other events can happen, so the system remains in event3 forever.
3. Therefore event1 never happens, so C1 is false in the initial state and in every future state.
4. Hence C2 (C1 in the next state) is false, and C3 (C2 in the next state) is also false.

1. C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" (globally in every state). C2 is the same.
2. The context says: Initially, event3 happened. That means in the initial state event3 is true and event2 is false.

2. C1 = ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every state). This is false at s0 (s0 has event1) and false at any state that is e3, so C1 is false.

3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = C1 at s1. At s1 we have event3, so C1 is false at s1. Thus C2 is false at s0.

4. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" = C2 at s1 (or equivalently C1 at s2). At s2 we have event2, but C1 requires event2 at every future state; s3 is event3, so C1 is false at s2, hence C2 is false at s1, so C3 is false at s0.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some current or future state where C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (at every state along the execution, C2 holds).

System behavior from the context:
- Initially: event2.
- After event2 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → no other events can happen (so once at event3, the system stays at event3 forever).
- After event1 → event3 must happen.

Trace the execution:
- State 0: event2 is true. event3 is false, so C1 holds here (¬event3 holds). Hence C2 holds at state 0 (C1 already true).
- State 1 and onward: event3 is true and remains true forever; event1 never occurs in these states (no other events can happen). In any such state C1 is false (event3 true but event1 false), and it will never become true in the future from that point. Thus C2 is false at state 1 (C1 does not eventually hold).

Since there exists a reachable state (the state with event3) where C2 is false, C2 does not hold at every state. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False.

1. C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" simplifies to: Event3 happens.

3. C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" → C3 = (next state's event3) AND (current state's event1).

Now use the context:
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → from the initial state the next state is event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal (all following states remain event1).
- After event3, event1 must happen — irrelevant here because event3 never occurs given the above.

Check C3 at each reachable state:
- At the initial state (event2): event1 is false, and the next state is event1 (not event3), so C2 is false. Thus C3 is false.
- At the next/state event1: event1 is true, but the next state is event1 (not event3), so C2 is false. Thus C3 is false here as well.
No reachable state makes ""next state's event3"" true, so C3 can never be true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1. After event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3; both event2 and event3 are terminal (no further events).
2. C1 is (event2 -> event3). C2 is (event3 OR C1). C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state.
3. Consider the next-state possibilities after the initial event1:
   - If the next state is event3, then event3 is true there, so C2 is true in that next state.
   - If the next state is event2, then event2 is true and event3 is false there. Then C1 (event2 -> event3) is false, and event3 is false, so C2 is false in that next state.
4. Because there is a possible next state (the event2 branch) where C2 is false, C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed by the context.

Therefore C3 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 = ""event3 eventually happens"". This is true at the initial state because event3 holds initially.
2. C2 = ""C1 holds or event3 happens"". Since event3 is true initially (and C1 is also true), C2 is true at the initial state.
3. C3 = ""C2 holds and event1 happens"". For C3 to be true in a state we need both C2 true in that same state and event1 true in that state.
4. A state where event1 holds is an event1 state. After event1 no other events can happen (event1 is absorbing), so in any event1 state event3 will never happen in the future. Thus C1 is false in any event1 state, and event3 is false there as well. Hence C2 is false in any event1 state.
5. Therefore there is no state where both C2 and event1 are true simultaneously. In particular, C3 is false at the initial state and cannot become true later.

1. C1 says: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" The context says ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen.""

2. C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" That must hold for any state where event2 occurs. But the context rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" ensures that whenever event2 happens, the next state is event2, so C1 holds whenever event2 holds. Therefore C2 is true.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to just Event1.

1. C1 and C2 are identical: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., event1 is true in every state along a run). C3 is C1 or C2, so C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 always happens.""

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1 is true (state0).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (state1).
   - After event2, either event1 or event3 happens.
   - After event3, no other events can happen (state3 is terminal/stays at event3).

3. Consider the possible trace that chooses event3 after event2:
   - state0: event1
   - state1: event2
   - state2: event3
   - state3+: stays at event3

   In this trace, event1 is not true in state1 (event2) or any later state (event3). So ""event1 always happens"" is false on this trace.

4. Because there exists a valid trace (the one going event1 → event2 → event3 → ...) where event1 does not hold at all times, ""Event1 always happens"" is not true universally. Therefore both C1 and C2 are false, so C3 (their disjunction) is false.

Context summary:
- Start: event3 holds now.
- From event3: next must be either event1 or event2.
- From event1: no other events can happen (stays at event1 forever).
- From event2: next must be event3.

Hypothesis definitions:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens (F event2).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (X C1).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state (X X C1).

We ask whether C3 is true at the initial state.

Consider the possible continuation from the initial state (event3):
- If the system chooses event1 next, the run is event3 → event1 → event1 → ...
  - At the state two steps ahead (event1), event2 will never happen (event1 is terminal), so C1 is false there.
  - Therefore C2 is false at the next state, and C3 is false at the initial state on this branch.

Because the choice event3 → event1 is allowed by the context and on that branch C3 is false, C3 is not guaranteed true in the model.

1. Initially event2 is true.
2. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means from a state where event2 happened the only possible next event is event2 itself (a self-loop). So once in event2, event2 holds in every future state.
3. C1 is (event2 AND event2), which is equivalent to event2 — true exactly when event2 holds.

1. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" — interpreted as both events holding in the same state (consistent with the examples).
2. In this model exactly one event holds in each state (states correspond to which event just happened). So no single state can have both event1 and event3 true simultaneously.
3. Therefore C1 is impossible — it is false in every state.

Reasoning (step by step):
1. C1 and C2 are the same statement: ""Event2 eventually happens"". C3 requires that statement to hold (twice, but identical).
2. Start: event3 holds initially.
3. From event3 the rules allow either event1 or event2 next (non-deterministic choice).
4. If after event3 we always pick event1, and after event1 we always pick event3 (both choices allowed by the rules), we get the infinite trace: 3,1,3,1,...
5. That trace never contains event2, so there exists a valid execution where event2 never happens.
6. Because event2 is not guaranteed on all executions, ""Event2 eventually happens"" is not entailed by the context.
7. Therefore C1 (and C2) can be false on some runs, so C3 (C1 and C2) is not guaranteed.

Thus C3 is False."

1. C1 says ""Event1 always happens."" From the context: initially event1 happens, but after event1, event3 must happen. So the very next state is event3 (not event1). Therefore event1 does not hold in every state — C1 is false.

2. C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false (a false conjunct makes the whole conjunction false), regardless of whether event2 occurs later.

3. C3 is ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is already false, it cannot hold always. Therefore C3 is false.

1. Interpret the context as state-based: in each state exactly one event holds. Transitions are:
   - initial state: event3.
   - after event3 → next state event1.
   - after event1 → next state event3.
   - after event2 → next state event1 (event2 never occurs from the initial run).

2. So from the initial state we get an infinite alternating sequence: event3, event1, event3, event1, ...

3. C1 is the state formula ""if event1 happens then event3 happens"" (i.e., event1 → event3 in the same state). Because at most one event holds per state, any state where event1 is true has event3 false, so the implication is false in any state where event1 occurs.

4. C2 is ""event1 happens and C1 holds"" in a single state. That requires event1 true and C1 true simultaneously. But from (3), whenever event1 is true, C1 is false. Therefore C2 is false in every state.

5. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false in every state, it is false in the next state as well. Therefore C3 is false at the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. C1 = (event1 or event2). So C1 is true in the initial state (because event1).
3. C2 = “C1 holds in the next state”, i.e. next-state (event1 or event2).
4. From event1 the next state must be either event2 or event3.
   - If the next state is event2, then C1 holds there (event2 true) → C2 true.
   - If the next state is event3, then neither event1 nor event2 holds there → C1 false → C2 false.
5. C3 = (event2 happens) or C2. In the initial state event2 is false, so C3 depends on C2.

- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (irrelevant because we never reach event2).

- After event3, event2 must happen → s2: event2.
- Then it alternates: s3: event3, s4: event2, ...

- C2 at s0 requires s1 to have event3. s1 is event3, so C2 is true at s0.
- C3 at s0 requires C2 to be true in s1, i.e. requires s2 to have event3. But s2 is event2, so C1 is false in s2, hence C2 is false in s1, so C3 is false at s0.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""event3 and event2"" — that requires both events to hold in the same state.
2. By the context, exactly one event holds in each state (transitions move between events), so C1 is impossible (always false).
3. C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., in any state where event2 is true, C1 must also be true.
4. Since C1 is always false, any state where event2 is true makes the implication false.
5. Are there states where event2 happens? Yes: from the initial event1 -> event3, the transition after event3 may choose event2, so event2 can occur.
6. Therefore C2 is false (there exist reachable states with event2 true but C1 false).

1. Context summary: Initially event1 is true. From event1 the next state must be either event2 or event3. After event2 no other events can happen (terminal). After event3 no other events can happen (terminal). States are mutually exclusive for events (only one event true per state).

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreted as ""event1 is false in a given state."" At the initial state event1 is true, so C1 is false there. But in later states (event2 or event3 states) event1 will be false, so C1 can hold in those states.

3. C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" That requires a state where event3 is true and event1 is false. Such a state exists: the event3 terminal state (sequence event1 -> event3). So C2 can be true in the event3 state.

4. C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" This requires a single state where event2 and event3 are both true (because C2 includes event3 true). Since events are exclusive, event2 and event3 cannot be true in the same state. Also the event2 terminal state has event3 false, so C2 is false there. Therefore there is no state where both event2 and C2 hold simultaneously.

5. Conclusion: C3 cannot be satisfied in any reachable state.

3. Rule: After event3, event1 must happen. Therefore the next state must be event1.

Step 2 — interpret formulas as state propositions:
- C1 = (event1 → event3) i.e. in a state either event1 is false or event3 is true.
- C2 = (event3) OR (C1).
- C3 = C2 always holds (C2 must be true in every state along the trace).

Step 3 — evaluate along the trace:

- At the next state and all subsequent states (event1): event1 is true and event3 is false, so C1 is false and event3 is false; hence C2 = false in these states.

Initial state: event2.

From event2 there are two possible next states: event1 or event3.

1) If the next state is event3:
   - At the initial state, C1 is true (the next state is event3).
   - But C2 asks that C1 hold in the next state (i.e., event3 at two steps ahead). From event3 the subsequent state must be event1, so at two steps ahead event3 is false → C2 is false.
   - At the initial state event3 is false (we have event2), and C2 is false, so C3 is false in this branch.

2) If the next state is event1:
   - From event1 we can choose event3 at the following step, making event3 true two steps ahead, so C2 (X X event3) could be true in this branch, and then C3 would be true. 

Because there exists a valid run (the one where event2 → event3 → event1) in which C3 is false at the initial state, C3 is not guaranteed by the context.

Context sequence:

- From event2 → event1.

So the system cycles: state0: event3, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event3, … and repeats.

Interpret the formulas (evaluated at the initial state, as in the examples):
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because at state1 event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This requires both (a) event2 is true in the current state, and (b) event2 will eventually occur (C1). C1 is true in every state (because the cycle repeats), but event2 is true only in states where event2 holds (state1, state4, ...). So C2 is true in states where event2 holds (e.g., state1) and false in others (e.g., initial state).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" This requires in the same state both event2 (since C2 requires event2 now) and event1 to hold simultaneously. But event1 and event2 never hold at the same time in any state (each state has exactly one event). Therefore C3 is false in all states.

1. C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which simplifies to: Event1 happens (in the current state).

2. C2 is ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"", i.e. Event3 and Event1 hold simultaneously in the same state.

3. From the context:
   - Initially event2.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is absorbing).
   - There is no rule that ever leads to event3 from event1 or event2, so event3 never occurs in any reachable run; the system alternates event2 ↔ event1 forever starting from the initial event2.

4. Even ignoring reachability, C2 requires event1 and event3 to be true in the same state. As in the examples, only one event can be true in a state, so that is impossible.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context gives the only possible trace: initially event3; after event3 event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 forever). Thus the execution is event3 → event1 → event1 → ...
2. C3 is (C2 holds) AND (event2 happens).
3. In the trace above, event2 never happens (there is no transition to event2 anywhere).
4. Therefore the conjunct ""event2 happens"" is false, so C3 is false, regardless of whether C2 holds.
5. (For completeness: C2 — ""if event1 happens then C1 holds"" — would be true in the suffix from the first event1 onward because event1 then holds forever; C1 globally is false because the initial state had event3. But this does not change that event2 never occurs.)

So C3 is False."

   - thereafter: event2 forever (after event2 no other events can happen → event2 is absorbing)

2. C1 = ""Event3 always happens"" means: at the current state and at every future state event3 holds. This is false at the initial state because although event3 holds initially, the next state is event1 (so event3 does not hold there). C1 is false at all later states too (they are event1 or event2), so C1 never holds at any time.

3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" requires there exists some future state where C1 is true. Since C1 never holds in any state (no state from which event3 holds forever), C2 is false.

4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" requires C2 to hold at some future time. But C2 is always false, so C3 is false.

1. Build the transition graph from the context:
   - Initially: e2.
   - e2 -> e1 (must).
   - e1 -> e2 or e3 (choice).
   - e3 -> e2 (must).
   So possible infinite runs include e2 → e1 → e2 → e1 → ... or e2 → e1 → e3 → e2 → ...

2. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1: ""Eventually e3"" (F e3).
   - C2: ""C1 holds or e1 holds"" = (F e3) ∨ e1, evaluated at each state.
   - C3: ""Always C2"" = G((F e3) ∨ e1).

3. Find a counterexample path:
   - Consider the run that always picks the e2 successor from e1: e2, e1, e2, e1, ...
   - On this run e3 never occurs, so F e3 is false at every state.
   - At e2 states, e1 is false, and since e3 never occurs from this run, F e3 is false — so C2 is false at every e2 state (including the initial state).

4. Conclusion:
   - Because there exists a valid run where at some states (e.g. the initial e2) C2 is false, C2 does not hold always.
   - Therefore C3 is False.

1. C1 = (event2) OR (event1).
2. C2 = (event1) OR C1 = event1 OR (event1 OR event2) = event1 OR event2.
   So C2 holds exactly in states where the current event is 1 or 2.
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., in every state along the execution, the current event must be 1 or 2.

Now use the context:
- Initially event1 (so C2 true initially).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. The choice event3 is allowed.
- If event3 happens, the current state is event3, and C2 (event1 or event2) is false there.
- Therefore there exists a valid execution (initial event1 then event3) where C2 does not hold at that later state, so C2 is not true in all states of all executions.

1. Context summary:
   - Initial state: event2 is true.
   - After event2, no other events can happen — so from any state where event2 holds the system stays at event2 forever (self-loop).
   - After event3, event2 must happen (not reachable here because we start at event2 and can't leave).
   - After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant because event1 never occurs).

2. Interpret the hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., X event2).
   - C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" — meaning (X event2) ∧ event3 in the same state.
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., F C2).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - From the initial event2 state, because after event2 no other events can happen, the next state is also event2. So C1 is true at the initial state (and in every state).

4. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 requires event3 to hold in the same state where C1 holds.
   - But starting at event2 the system cannot transition to any other event; event3 never occurs in any state.

1. Only one event can hold in any state (as in the examples).
2. Initially event3 holds.

3. From event1 the next state can be event2 (one allowed choice). Consider the run: 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → ...
4. In that run, event2 does not hold in every state (states with event3 and event1 occur), so C1 is false when evaluated from the next state. Hence C2 is false at the initial state.

1. Initially event2 holds.
2. After event2, event3 must happen. So the next state is event3.
3. After event3, there is a choice: either event1 happens or event2 happens.
   - If we choose event1 at that point, event1 occurs (and then no other events can happen).
   - If we choose event2, the system returns to event3 and the choice repeats.
4. Therefore there exists a run (initial event2 → event3 → event1) in which event1 eventually happens.
5. C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens"" — it is satisfied (there is a reachable future state with event1).
6. C2 is the same as C1, so it is also satisfied.
7. C3 is C1 or C2, so C3 is satisfied.

1. Interpret formulas as state formulas unless a temporal operator (next/eventually/always) is explicitly present. So ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" means in the same state: event1 → event2.
2. Evaluate C1 at the initial state. Initially event1 is true and only one event can hold in a state, so event2 is false in the initial state. Thus C1 (event1 → event2) is false at the initial state.
3. C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. event1 → C1 (again a same-state implication). Because event1 is true initially but C1 is false there, C2 is false at the initial state.

5. C3 is ""Event3 happens and C2 holds."" Even ignoring C2, the initial state does not have event3 (it has event2), so the first conjunct is also false.
6. Since C2 is false (and event3 is not true initially), C3 is false.

1. C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens.""
2. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, event3 eventually happens (including possibly in that next state itself).
3. C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e., in the current state it is not true that in the next state event3 eventually happens.

Now use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So the next state after the initial state is an event3 state.
- In that next state event3 is true immediately, so ""event3 eventually happens"" (C1) holds in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is true in the initial state.
- Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

1. Interpret formulas as state propositions (as in the examples):  
   - ""EventX happens"" means X is true in the current state.  
   - C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" means in the current state event1 is false.  
   - C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" means (event3 is true) OR (event1 is false) in the current state.  
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" means in every state along the execution C2 is true.

2. Use the context transitions:
   - Initially event2 holds.
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so next state is event1).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so next is event2).
   Thus the trace is event2, event1, event2, event1, ... alternating forever. Event3 never occurs.

3. Evaluate C2 along the trace:
   - At states where event2 holds: event1 is false, so C1 holds, hence C2 holds.
   - At states where event1 holds: event1 is true, event3 is false, so C1 is false and event3 is false ⇒ C2 is false at those states.

4. Since there are states (the event1 states) where C2 is false, C2 does not hold in all states. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

- C1 is a state formula: (event2 → event3), i.e. in the same state if event2 holds then event3 holds.
- C2 is (C1 ∧ event3), so C2 holds exactly in states where event3 holds (because in event3 states C1 is true; in event2 states C1 is false; in event1 states event3 is false).
- C3 is “C2 always holds” (globally true in every state of the run).

Step 2 — trace the system from the context:
- Initial state: event1.
- After event1, event3 must happen → next state event3.
- After event3, event2 must happen → next state event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen → next state event3.
- So the run is: event1, event3, event2, event3, event2, ... (alternating after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C3 on that run:
- C2 is false in the initial state (event1) because event3 is false there.
- Since C2 is not true in every state (it fails at the initial state), C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false.

1. Interpret the formulas as state properties (as in the examples): ""EventX happens"" means X is true in the current state; only one event is true in any given state.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initial state: event3 holds.
2. Transition rules:
   - After event3: next state must be either event1 or event2.
   - After event1: next state must be event2.
   - After event2: next state must be event3.
3. From the initial event3 we can follow e3 -> e1 -> e2 -> e3 -> ... (a 3-cycle), or e3 -> e2 -> e3 -> ... (repeating e3 and e2, with e3 sometimes going to e1).
4. In any valid run there are states where event3 holds (e.g., the initial state). Therefore event2 does not hold in every state.
5. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
6. C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" — since C1 is false, C2 is false.
7. C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — since C2 is false, C3 is false.

   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would be a terminal self-loop), but there is no rule allowing a transition to event2 from event1 or event3.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C3 = ""C2 holds and event2 happens"". So for C3 to be true there must be a state where C2 is true and event2 is true.

2. C2 = ""C1 holds and event1 happens"". So C2 requires a state where event1 is true and C1 is true.

3. C1 = ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreting these formulas in the same-state sense used in the examples, C1 requires that whenever event1 is true in a state then event2 is also true in that same state.

4. But events are mutually exclusive in a single state (only one event can be true at a time). Therefore there is no state in which both event1 and event2 are true simultaneously.

5. Thus there cannot be any state where event1 is true and C1 is simultaneously true (because if event1 is true C1 would demand event2 also true, which is impossible). So C2 is impossible (always false).

6. If C2 is always false, then C3 = (C2 and event2) is also false.

Therefore C3 is False."

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" means at a state where C1 holds, event2 is true in that state and in every future state along that run.

2. From the context:
   - Initially event2 is true.
   - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (so event2 cannot follow event2).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (the system stays at event1).
   - After event3, event2 must happen (so 3 is followed by 2).

3. Could C1 ever hold at any state? For C1 to hold at some state t, every state from t onward must have event2. But after any event2 state the next state must be event1 or event3, so you cannot have event2 repeated or stay at event2. Therefore there is no state from which event2 holds at all future times. So C1 is always false.

4. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — since C1 never holds in any state, C2 is always false in every state.

5. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — because C2 never holds at any time, there is no future state where C2 becomes true. Thus C3 is false.

2. C1 = (event3 AND event2). That requires event2 and event3 to be true in the same state — impossible, so C1 is always false.
3. C2 = (event1 AND C1). Since C1 is always false, C2 is always false.
4. C3 = (If event1 happens, then C2 holds). In the initial state event1 is true but C2 is false, so the implication fails.
Therefore C3 is False."

1. Initially event2 happened.
2. The context says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" As in the examples, that means once event2 holds, the system stays at event2 forever (event2 is a sink).

Reasoning:

1. Interpret the formulas at the initial state:

   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = Event1 does not happen in the next state.

2. From the context: initially event3 happened. After event3, event1 must happen. So the next state after the initial state must have event1. Therefore C1 is true.

3. Since C1 is true, C2 = not C1 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The context describes a trace of single events: each state is identified by which one event happened (initially event3). As in the examples, only one of event1/event2/event3 can hold in any single state.
2. C1 is ""event3 happens and event2 happens"" — this requires event2 and event3 to be true simultaneously in the same state. Given (1), that is impossible in any state, so C1 is always false.
3. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is always false, C2 is also always false.
4. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1 holds two steps ahead). Because C1 can never hold, C2 can never hold, and thus C3 is false.

Check the claims:

- The next state after the initial state is again event1, so in the next state ¬event1 is false; thus C2 is false in the initial state.

- Because after the initial event1 the next state can be event2 (or event3), there exists a reachable state where event1 is false. Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" is not satisfied.

3. Trace the actual sequence:
   - state0: event1 (given).
   - state1: event3 (required after event1).
   - state2 and onward: event3 (no other events possible after event3).

4. Evaluate:
   - C1 at state0: false, because state1 is event3, not event1.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state s0: event2 is true.
2. From event2, event1 must happen next, so s1: event1.
3. From event1, no other events can happen, so the system stays at event1 forever (s1, s2, ... all have event1).
4. C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false at s0 (and at s1 onward) because event3 never occurs in this trace.

   - C2 = C1 OR event1 (either Next(event2) holds or event1 holds now).
   - C3 = C2 AND event2 (C2 holds now and event2 holds now).

2. Initial state: event3 holds (so event1 = false, event2 = false now).

3. Evaluate C3 at the initial state:
   - event2 is false now, so C3 (which requires event2 now) is false at the initial state regardless of C2.

4. Could C3 be true at some later state?
   - Consider a state where event2 is true (required by C3). In that state event1 is false (events are exclusive).
   - After event2, the context requires event1 next, so Next(event2) is false in an event2 state.
   - Thus in an event2 state, C2 = Next(event2) OR event1 = false OR false = false.
   - Therefore C3 = C2 AND event2 = false AND true = false in any event2 state.

Context transitions:
- Initial state: event3.
- From event3, the next state must be event2.
- From event2, the next state must be event3.
So the only allowed infinite trace is the alternating sequence: event3, event2, event3, event2, ...

Evaluate the claims:
1. C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
   - At the initial state (event3), the next state is event2, so C1 is false initially.
   - At an event2 state, the next state is event3, so C1 is true at event2 states; at event3 states, C1 is false.

2. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, the next state is event3).

3. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at the next state, C2 is true).
   - The next state from the initial state is event2. At that event2 state, C1 is true there but C1 fails at the subsequent event3 state, so C2 is not true at event2 either.

1. Start state: event3 is true (given ""Initially, event3 happened"").
2. From ""after event3, no other events can happen"" we get that once in event3 the system stays in event3 forever (every next state is also event3).
3. C1 = (event1 or event3). In any state where event3 holds, C1 is true. So C1 is true in the initial state and in all future states (because all states are event3).
4. C2 = C1 and event2. C2 therefore requires event2 to be true in the same state as C1. That means C2 requires event2 and (event1 or event3) simultaneously.
5. Because each state is event3 (from step 2), event2 is never true in any state. Even without that, the model assumes only one event holds in a state, so event2 cannot co-occur with event1 or event3 in the same state; therefore C2 is never true in any state.
6. C3 = “C2 holds in the next state.” Since C2 is false in every state, C2 is false in the next state as well. Therefore C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. System behavior from the context:
   - Initially event2.
   - After event2 → event3 must happen.
   - After event3 → event2 must happen.
   - Thus the system alternates forever: event2, event3, event2, event3, ...
   - There is no rule that ever makes event1 occur, so event1 never happens.

2. Evaluate C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens.""
   - This is a tautology (p → p). It is true in every state where it's evaluated. In particular, whenever event3 occurs in the run, C1 holds. So C1 holds.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 does not hold.""
   - Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds.""
   - C2 is false, and event1 never happens. Therefore C3 cannot be true.

Conclusion: C3 is False."

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (event2 ∧ event2 ≡ event2).
2. C2 is ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""always Event2"" (Event2 must be true in every state).
3. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — essentially asking whether ""always Event2"" is itself always true (redundant), so the question reduces to whether Event2 holds in every state along the run.

Now use the context (transition rules):
- Initially event2 holds.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state is event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after that is event2).
- After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant here since event3 never appears).

From the initial state event2, the next state is event1. Thus there is a state (the immediate successor) where event2 is false. Therefore Event2 does not hold in every state, so C2 is false, and hence C3 is false.

1. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" (globally C2).
2. C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"".
3. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (globally event1).
4. From the context: initially event1, then after event1 must come event2, and thereafter event2 and event3 alternate (event2 → event3 → event2 → ...). So event1 does not hold in all states — C1 is false.
5. With C1 false, C2 simplifies to just ""Event3 happens"" (in the current state).

Reasoning:
- Start: initially event1.
- From event1, the rules allow the next state to be event3.
- At that event3 state, the rules allow the next state to be event1.
- So there exists an execution (path) event1 -> event3 -> event1 ...
- At the event3 state on this path: event3 is true and the next state is event1, so C2 (C1 holds and event3 happens) is true at that state (C1 = ""event1 in the next state"").

   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ event2 AND (not event1).
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — we must check C2 in the state immediately after the initial state.

2. From the context:
   - Initially event3 holds.
   - After event3, no other events can happen → the next state is event3 again (it stays at event3).

3. In the next state: event3 = true, event2 = false, event1 = false. So C2 (event2 AND not event1) is false in that next state.

1. Context transitions:
   - Initially event3 is true.
   - From event3, event2 must happen next.
   - From event2, event3 must happen next.
   - From event1, event2 or event3 may happen next.
   (Thus the actual trace starting from the initial state is: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ...)

2. Interpretations (as in the examples): only one event can be true in any single state, and conjunctions refer to a single state.

3. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens."" This requires event1 and event3 to be true in the same state. That is impossible because at any state only one event is true. So C1 is always false.

4. Evaluate C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is an implication evaluated in a state. It would be vacuously true only in states where event2 does not happen. But in the next state after the initial state, event2 does happen (by the context), so the antecedent is true there. Because C1 is always false, the implication is false in any state where event2 holds. In particular, C2 is false in the state immediately following the initial state.

5. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state after the initial event3 is event2, and as just shown C2 is false in that state. Therefore C3 is false.

Reasoning (concise):
1. C1 is ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"" (event2 -> event2), which is a tautology — true in every state.
2. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true whenever a next state exists; from the initial state there is a next state (event2), so C2 holds.
3. C3 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and event1 happens"". Although C2 holds, event1 does not hold in the initial state — initially event3, then event2, and from event2 no other events can occur, so event1 never occurs.
4. Because event1 never holds, C3 is false."

1. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., X event1).  
2. C2 = ""always C1"" (i.e., in every state, the next state is event1).  
3. C3 = ""always C2"" (i.e., in every state, C2 holds).

From the context:
- Initially event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after the initial is event2).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, only event3 can happen (it stays at event3).

So the unique timeline is: state0: event1 → state1: event2 → state2: event3 → state3: event3 → ...

Evaluate C1:
- At state0, the next state is event2, not event1, so C1 is false at state0.

Therefore C2 (""always C1"") is false (since C1 fails at the initial state), and hence C3 (""always C2"") is also false.

1. Initial state: event2 is true.

Reasoning:
1. C1 = ""event2 eventually happens."" From the initial state (event1), the next state is either event2 or event3. In both choices event2 occurs at or by the next step (if next is event2 it's immediate; if next is event3 then the rule after event3 forces event2 next). So C1 holds at the initial state.
2. C2 = ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" Thus C2 is true exactly in states where event3 holds (because C1 is true from any state that has event3).
3. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., the next state must have event3 (equivalently, the next state must be an event3 state).
4. From the initial state (event1) the next state may be event2 or event3. If the next state is event2, then C2 does not hold in that next state (event3 is false there). Therefore C3 is not guaranteed to hold from the initial state.
5. Because there is a permitted transition (event1 → event2) that makes C3 false, C3 is not true in the model.

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — this means in the current state and all future states event2 holds.
2. Initially event3 happens, so C1 is false at the initial state (event2 is not true initially).
3. Could C1 ever become true at some later state? To make C1 true at some state s, from s onward every state must be event2.
   - From event2 the rules say the next state must be either event1 or event3, so event2 cannot hold forever from an event2 state.
   - Event1 is terminal but is not event2, so it cannot satisfy ""event2 always"".
   - Event3 can lead to event1 or event2, so it does not guarantee event2 always.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initial state has event2 true. Transition rules force: after event2 -> event1, after event1 -> event2. Thus the system alternates 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 ... forever. Event3 never occurs in any reachable state.

2. Interpret the hypothesis formulas at a state:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (a next-state claim).
   - C2: ""If event1 happens (now), then C1 holds"" (i.e. if current state is event1, then the next state must be event3).
   - C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" (both must be true in the same state).

3. Check states:
   - Initial state (event2): event1 is false, so C3 is false (conjunction requires event1 true).
   - In any event1 state: event1 is true, but the next state is event2 (not event3), so C1 is false and thus C2 is false; therefore C3 is false there too.

4. Since C3 is false in the initial state and in all reachable states, the hypothesis C3 is False."

1. Interpret formulas as state properties. C1 is the state formula ""if event1 then event3"" (event1 → event3). C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (next(C1)). C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" (next(next(C1))).

2. Initial state: event1 happened (so current state has event1 true). From ""After event1, no other events can happen"" we use the same convention as the examples: the system stays at event1 in all future states (self-loop on event1).

3. Evaluate C1 in any state that has event1: C1 requires event3 to also hold in that same state. But only one event holds in a state (so event3 is false when event1 is true). Hence C1 is false in the initial state and in every future state (since the state remains event1 forever).

4. Thus C1 is false everywhere; therefore C2 = next(C1) is false in the initial state (the next state still has C1 false), and next(next(C1)) is also false.

5. Therefore C3 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Start at the initial state s0 where event3 holds.
2. From event3, the next state s1 must be event1 (by the rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"").
3. C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state, i.e., C2 must hold at s1.
4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (¬C1). So we must check C1 at s1.
5. C1 is ""event3 happens in the next state."" At s1 (event1), the next state s2 must be event3 (by ""After event1, event3 must happen""), so C1 is true at s1.
6. Therefore C2 = ¬C1 is false at s1.
7. Since C2 does not hold at s1, C3 (that C2 holds in the next state) is false."

1. Initial state: event2 holds.
2. Rules enforce transitions:
   - After event2, event3 must hold next.
   - After event3, event2 must hold next.
   - After event1, event3 must hold next.
3. From the initial event2, the sequence of states is forced: event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... (alternating 2 and 3). No transition allows event1 to appear, because from event2 the next is event3, and from event3 the next is event2.

Context transitions:
- Initial state: event3 is true.
- From event3, the next state must be event2.
- From event2, the next state must be event3.
- From event1, the next state would be event3 (but event1 is never reached from the initial condition).

Only one event occurs per state, so reachable states alternate: event3, event2, event3, ...

Evaluate the formulas:
- C1: (event3 -> event1). This is false in any state where event3 is true and event1 is false, and true when event3 is false.
  - In event3 states: C1 is false (event3 true, event1 false).
  - In event2 states: C1 is true (event3 false).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At the initial state (event3), the next state is event2, and in that next state C1 is true. So C2 is true at the initial state.

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens and Event1 happens"" — this is a conjunction that must hold in a single state (as in the examples).
2. From the context, exactly one event holds in each state (events are sequential): the initial state is event3, and after event3 the next state is either event1 or event2; after event1 or event2 the system is stuck at that event.
3. Therefore no single state can have both event3 and event1 true simultaneously. So C1 is false in every state.
4. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 never holds, C2 is false.

1. Interpret the dynamics:
   - s0 (initial): event2.
   - After event2, event3 must happen, so s1: event3.
   - After event3, no other events can happen, so from s1 onward it's event3 forever.
   - (Event1 never occurs in these runs.)

2. Evaluate C1 (event1 or event2) at states:
   - At s0: event2 is true, so C1 is true.
   - At s1 and all later states: only event3 holds, so C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2 (C1 holds in the next state) at states:
   - At s0: C2 asks whether C1 holds in s1; C1(s1) is false, so C2 is false at s0.
   - At s1: C2 asks whether C1 holds in s2; s2 is event3 so C1(s2) is false, so C2 is false at s1.
   - By same reasoning, C2 is false at every state (since all next states are event3-only where C1 is false).

4. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". Since C2 never holds at any state, C3 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Model the states as events (exactly one event true per state). Transitions from the context:
   - 1 -> 3 (after event1, event3 must happen)
   - 3 -> {1, 2} (after event3, either event1 or event2)
   - 2 -> {1, 3} (after event2, either event1 or event3)
   - Initial state is event1.

2. Interpret formulas:
   - C1: ""event2 eventually happens"" (from the current point on the same path).
   - C2: C1 OR event1 (holds in a state if either event1 holds now or event2 will occur later on that path).
   - C3: always C2 (C2 must hold in every state along every possible path).

3. Produce a counterexample path that satisfies the transition rules but violates C3:
   - Choose the infinite path 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... (always choose 3 -> 1).
   - On this path event2 never occurs, so C1 is false at every state.
   - At every state labeled 3 on this path, event1 is false and C1 is false, so C2 is false there.
   - Therefore C2 does not hold at all states on this path, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") fails.

4. Because there exists a valid execution where C3 is violated, C3 is False."

1. Initial state: event3 is true.
2. After event3, event2 must happen — so the next state is event2.
3. After event2, no other events can happen — so once at event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
4. Therefore the only possible trace is: initial (event3) -> event2 -> event2 -> ...

Now evaluate the claims:

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false because in the initial state event1 is not true (event3 is), and event1 never occurs later either.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" For C2 to be true there must be some future state from which C1 (event1 always happens) holds. No such state exists (event1 never holds), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state is event2, and as just shown C2 is false there. So C3 is false.

1. Context: initially event1 is true. From event1 the next state must be event3. From event3 no other events can happen (so the system stays at event3 thereafter).
2. C1 = (event1) or (event3).
   - At the initial state event1 is true, so C1 holds initially; once at event3, C1 also holds (because event3 is true).
3. C2 = (event3) and (C1).
   - Since C1 is (event1 or event3), C2 simplifies to just event3 (event3 ∧ (event1 ∨ event3) ≡ event3).
4. C3 = C2 always holds, i.e. event3 must hold in every state.
5. Check initial state: event1 holds and event3 does not hold in the initial state. Therefore C2 (equivalently event3) is false at the initial state.

1. Context transitions: initially event2. After event2 → event3. After event3 → event2. After event1 → event2.
2. From the initial state the system is forced into the repeating cycle: s0 = event2, s1 = event3, s2 = event2, s3 = event3, ... (alternating 2,3,2,3,...). Event1 never occurs.
3. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This means at a given state, from that state onward every state must have event2. In the actual run, some states have event3, so C1 is false at every state (e.g., s1 is event3, s2 is event2 but s3 is event3 — so ""always"" fails).
4. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At the initial state this requires C1 to hold at s1. But C1 is false at s1 (see step 3), so C2 is false at the initial state.
5. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Evaluated at the initial state, this requires C2 to hold at s1, i.e., that C1 holds at s2. But C1 is false at s2 (since s3 is event3), so C2 is false at s1 and therefore C3 is false at the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the state formula ""if event2 then event3"". Since states are single-event, C1 is equivalent to ""not event2"" in any given state (the implication is true exactly when event2 does not hold in that state).
2. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (globally). That means event2 never occurs at any future time.
3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"": there exists a future point after which event2 never occurs (i.e., from some time on, C1 holds in every state).
4. The context allows the infinite trace 3,2,3,2,3,2,... (after 3 you may go to 2; after 2 you may go to 3). On that trace event2 occurs infinitely often, so there is no suffix with no event2.
5. Therefore there is a valid behavior where C2 never becomes permanently true, so C3 is not guaranteed by the context.

Hence C3 is False."

- From event2 the next state must be either event1 or event3 (so event3 is allowed immediately).
- Other rules do not prevent choosing event3 from event2.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Initial state: event2 is true. The next state must be either event1 or event3.
2. C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So evaluate C2 in each possible next state.
3. C2 is ""event1 happens AND C1 holds."" C1 is ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event1 => event2 in the same state).
4. If the next state is event1: event1 is true but event2 is false there, so C1 (event1 => event2) is false. Thus C2 = true AND false = false.

Evaluate C2 and C3:
- At s0, C2 would require s1 to have event2. But s1 is event1 or event3, so C2 is false at s0.
- C3 at s0 requires C2 to hold at s1. At s1, C2 would require s2 to have event2, but s2 = s1 = event1 or event3, so C2 is false at s1. Thus C3 is false at s0.

1. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — this means at every state/event in the future, event1 is true.
2. But the initial state is event2, so event1 is not true initially. Therefore C1 is false already.
3. More generally, even if we start at a state where event1 holds, the rules force: after event1, event3 must happen. So you cannot stay forever in event1; event1 cannot hold at every future state from any point. Thus C1 is impossible at any point.
4. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — this would require that at some future time, from that time onward C1 is true (i.e., event1 holds at all subsequent times). From (3) we know that can never occur, so C2 is false at all times.
5. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — this would require that at some future time C2 becomes true. Since C2 can never be true, C3 is also false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event3 is true.
2. From event3 the next state must be either event1 or event2 (nondeterministic choice).
3. C1 is the implication (event2 -> event1) evaluated in a single state.
4. If the next state is event1, then event2 is false there, so C1 is true (implication vacuously true).
5. If the next state is event2, then event2 is true and event1 is false (only one event holds per state), so C1 is false.
6. Therefore there exists a permissible next state (the one with event2) where C1 does not hold, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") does not hold in the initial state.

- Initially event1 happened; after event1 the system may go to either event2 or event3.

1. C1 = ""event2 holds in the next state"" (next(event2)).
2. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (globally: in every state next(event2) holds).
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" — equivalent to ""always (always next(event2))"", which is just ""always next(event2)"" (so every state must have event2 in its next state).

4. From the context: initially event1. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (nondeterministic choice). After event3, no other events can happen (so from event3 the next state is event3, not event2).

5. Therefore there is a valid execution where initial event1 is followed by event3. In that execution, from the initial state the next state is event3, so C1 (next(event2)) is false at the initial state. Also at the state event3, the next state is event3, so C1 is false there as well.

2. From the context: the initial state has event2 true. After event2, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event2 forever. Thus event1 and event3 never occur in any state.

3. Therefore:
   - C1 is false in the initial (and all) states (event2 does happen).
   - C2 is false (event3 never occurs).
   - C3 is false (requires event1 and event3 simultaneously, and neither ever occurs).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. at every state from now on event1 is true).
2. But from the context, after event1 the next event must be event2. Thus no two consecutive states can both be event1; in particular you cannot have all states be event1 forever. So C1 can never hold at any state.
3. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. at every future state C1 is true). Since C1 never holds at any state, C2 can never hold.
4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" asks whether there is some future state where C2 becomes true. Because C2 is impossible, C3 is false."

1. Context trace from the initial state: Initially event2 happens.
2. After event2, event3 must happen — so the next state is event3.
3. After event3, no other events can happen — once at event3, the system stays at event3 forever.
4. Thus along the only possible run: event2 → event3 → event3 → ...
5. Event1 never occurs in this run (no state has event1 true).
6. C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true in every state of this run.
7. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true in any state whose next state does not have event1; here the next state is event3 which indeed does not have event1, so C2 holds where applicable (in particular it holds in the state where event2 occurs).
8. C3 is ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" — it requires a state where event1 is true. But there is no state where event1 happens.
9. Therefore C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must check whether C2 can be true in the immediate successor(s) of the initial state.

2. C1 is ""event3 AND event1"" — that requires event3 and event1 to hold simultaneously in one state. As in the examples, exactly one event holds per state, so C1 is impossible and therefore false in every state.

3. C2 is ""event3 AND C1"". Since C1 is always false, C2 is false in every state.

4. From the initial state (event3), the next state must be either event1 or event2 (by the rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen""). In neither possible next state can C2 be true (C2 is always false).

1. C1 is “Event1 always happens.” From the context, initially event1, but after event1 the next state must be event3. So there is a state where event1 is false (the immediate next state). Therefore C1 is false.

2. C2 is the implication “If C1 holds, then event3 happens.” A material implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 holds (is true) in the model.

3. C3 is “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 does hold, C3 is false.

1. Timeline from the context:
   - t0 (initial): event3 holds.
   - After event3, event2 must happen, so t1: event2 holds.
   - After event2, no other events can happen, so from t1 onward we remain in states with event2.

2. Interpret the formulas as state formulas:
   - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" — i.e., in a state: event2 → event1.
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., C1 is false in that state.
   - C3: ""Event3 happens and C2 holds"" — both must be true in the same state.

3. Evaluate by state:
   - At t0: event3 = true, event2 = false. The implication event2 → event1 is vacuously true, so C1 holds at t0. Therefore C2 is false at t0. Thus C3 (event3 ∧ C2) is false at t0.
   - At t1 and all later states: event2 = true (event1 = false), so C1 is false and C2 is true, but event3 is false. Thus C3 is false at t1 and later.

4. There is no state where both event3 and C2 hold simultaneously. Therefore C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: transitions are 1 -> 1 (after event1 no other events can happen), 2 -> 2 (after event2 no other events can happen), and 3 -> 2 (after event3 must go to event2). Initial state is event1.
2. Starting at event1, the system stays at event1 forever (no transition to event3 or event2).
3. Therefore ""Event3 eventually happens"" (C1) is false.
4. C3 requires both ""Event3 happens"" and C2 to hold. Since Event3 does not happen, C3 is false. (Note: C2 would also be false if evaluated at a state where event2 holds, because from event2 event3 never occurs, so the implication would fail; regardless, C3 already fails because Event3 is false.)"

Step 3 — evaluate the hypothesis parts
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" (globally). That requires event1 to hold in every state of every run.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once event2 holds, the system stays with event2 (every subsequent state also has event2).
- event1 and event3 would alternate if they occurred, but they never occur from event2.

Hypotheses definitions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., event2 is true in the state immediately after the current one).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = NOT C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = in the next state, NOT C1 (from that state's perspective).

Evaluate along the timeline:
- All states (initial and all future states) have event2 = true (because after event2 no other events can happen).
- Therefore, at every state, the next state also has event2 = true. So C1 is true at every state.
- Since C1 is always true, C2 = NOT C1 is always false.
- Consequently, in the next state C2 is false as well. So C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event2 does not happen.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" — at every state, the next state does not have event2. Equivalently, no state at index ≥1 can have event2 (event2 never occurs after the initial state).

2. System transitions from the context:

   - From event3: must go to either event1 or event2 (3 → 1 or 3 → 2).

3. Check whether C3 holds for all possible runs:
   - Start: state0 = event1. C2 at state0 requires state1 has not event2. State1 = event3, so C2 holds at state0.
   - Consider state1 = event3. C2 at state1 requires state2 has not event2. But from event3 a transition to event2 is allowed (3 → 2). Thus there exists a permitted run where state2 = event2, which makes C2 false at state1.

1. From the context: states are labeled by which single event ""happened"" in that state. Initially event1. After event1 → event2. After event2 → either event1 or event3. After event3 → event2. So possible infinite traces start at event1 then event2, and thereafter alternate between event2→event1→event2… or go event2→event3→event2→… and so on. At any single state exactly one of event1, event2, event3 holds.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Interpreted as both holding in the same state. Because only one event holds per state, C1 is impossible (false) in every state.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never holds at any future state, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds and event3 happens."" C2 is false, so C3 is false (regardless of event3).

Therefore C3 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. s0 (initial): event2 holds.
2. Rule: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" ⇒ any successor of a state with event2 must also be event2. So s1 = event2.
3. C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state."" Evaluated at s1, C1 says s2 = event2.
4. Because s1 = event2, the same rule forces s2 = event2, so C1 is true at s1.
5. C2 = ""C1 does not hold."" Thus C2 is false at s1.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system cycles deterministically: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...
2. C1 is ""event3 happens in the next state"" (X event3). At a state where event2 occurs, C1 is true (since next is event3). At a state where event3 occurs, C1 is false (next is event1). At a state where event1 occurs, C1 is false (next is event2).
3. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (G C1). That would require C1 to be true at every state. But as shown, C1 is false at states with event3 and event1, so C2 is false.
4. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2). Because the system is the repeating 2-3-1 cycle, there is no state after which C1 holds at every future state (C1 keeps failing at the subsequent states). Therefore C2 never becomes true at any future state, so C3 is false.

Reasoning:
1. Interpret C1 as the state formula (event2 → event1) (i.e., if event2 is true in a state then event1 is true in that same state). C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state."" C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (so C1 would have to hold two steps ahead).

2. From the context: initially event2 holds, and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means the system stays at event2 in all future states. So in every state event2 = true, event1 = false, event3 = false.

3. In every state event2 is true while event1 is false, so C1 (event2 → event1) is false in every state.

4. Hence C2 (C1 in the next state) is always false, and therefore C3 (C2 in the next state) is false.

Thus C3 is False."

1. C3 states: ""C2 always holds"" (C2 true in every state).
2. C2 is: C1 or event1.
3. C1 is: event1 and event3 (both in the same state).
4. Because only one event can hold in a single state, C1 is impossible — C1 is always false.
5. Hence C2 simplifies to just: event1.
6. From the context: initially event2; after event2, event3 must happen; after event3 no other events can happen. So the sequence is event2 → event3 and then stuck at event3. Event1 never occurs in any state.

1. Interpret the dynamics (one event per state, as in the examples):
   - Initially: event2 holds (state 0).
   - After event2, event1 must happen → state1: event1.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → it stays at event1 forever (state1, state2, ... all event1).
   - After event3 would allow event1 or event2, but event3 never occurs in this run.

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1 = (event1) OR (event3).
   - C2 = (event1) OR C1 = event1 OR (event1 OR event3) = event1 OR event3.
   - C3 = C2 always holds = ""for every state, event1 OR event3 holds"".

3. Check states:
   - State0 (initial): event2 holds, so event1 OR event3 is false → C2 is false at the initial state.
   - From state1 onward: event1 holds, so C2 is true in all subsequent states.

1. Context transitions:
   - Initially event2.
   - From event1 → either event2 or event3.
   - From event2 → event3.
   - From event3 → event1.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means at every future state the event is event1. That is false at the initial state because initially event2 holds (not event1). So C1 is false now.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" is the same as C1 (event1 holds at every time). So C2 is also false at the initial state.

4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" asks whether there is some future time after which event1 holds at every state forever. Could that happen?
   - From event1 there is no transition to event1; next must be event2 or event3. So you cannot stay at event1 consecutively.
   - Therefore there is no suffix of the run where every state is event1.
   - For example, starting from the initial event2 we have the possible run: event2 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... (alternating 1 and 3). In that run there is never a point after which only event1 occurs.

Reasoning:
1. ""Happens"" is a state predicate and only one event holds in any state.  
2. C1 = (event1 AND event2) requires both in the same state, which is impossible, so C1 is always false.  
3. C2 = C1 OR event2 therefore reduces to just event2 (since C1 is false). So C2 holds exactly in states where event2 holds.

Step 2 — evaluate in the model:
- Initially event1 holds, so Event3 is not true in the initial state.
- From event1 the next state may be event2 or event3. There exists a choice (event2) that can lead back to event1 and loop (event1 ↔ event2) indefinitely, avoiding event3 forever.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. From the context the allowed transitions (starting at event2) are: 2 -> 1 -> (2 or 3); if 3 occurs then 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> ...
2. As in the examples, only one event can hold in any single state.
3. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" — interpreted as both holding in the same state. That is impossible because at most one event is true per state. So C1 is never true.
4. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never holds at any time, C2 is false in every state.
5. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is always false, there is no future state where C2 holds, so C3 is false.

1. Simplify the formulas:
   - C1 = (Event1 happens) AND (Event1 happens) → C1 ≡ Event1 happens.
   - C2 = Event1 happens OR C1 → C2 ≡ Event1 happens OR Event1 happens → C2 ≡ Event1 happens.
   - C3 = Event2 happens OR C2 → C3 ≡ Event2 happens OR Event1 happens.

2. From the context, the run of events is:
   - Initial state: Event3 is true.
   - Next state: Event2 must happen.
   - After Event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays at Event2 thereafter).
   - Event1 never occurs in this run (there is no rule forcing Event1).

3. Evaluate C3 at the initial state (the usual interpretation here):
   - At the initial state Event2 is false and Event1 is false, so C3 (Event2 OR Event1) is false.

(If C3 had been intended as an eventual property — “Event2 happens sometime OR Event1 happens sometime” — then C3 would be true because Event2 does occur in the next state. But under the given plain/formula interpretation evaluated at the initial state, C3 is False.)

1. The system starts with event1. Transition rules force:
   - After event1, event3 must happen.
   - After event3, event1 must happen.
   - (After event2 → event3, but event2 never occurs here.)
   So the only possible infinite trace from the initial state is the alternating sequence: event1, event3, event1, event3, ...

2. Evaluate C2 in each state. C2 = (event1 holds now) OR (event3 holds in the next state).
   - In a state where event1 holds: C2 is true (because event1 holds now).
   - In a state where event3 holds: event1 does not hold now, and the next state from event3 is event1 (not event3). So ""event3 holds in the next state"" is false. Therefore C2 is false in any state where event3 holds.

3. Because the trace alternates, there are infinitely many states with event3 where C2 is false. Thus C2 does not hold in all states.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens.""
2. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event1 never happens (in the future).""
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" means from every state (in every possible run) Event1 never happens.
4. Context: initially event3, and after event3 either event1 or event2 must happen.
5. Therefore there is a permitted run where event1 happens in the next state (so C1 holds on that run).
6. On that run C2 is false (since event1 does occur), so C2 does not hold in all states/runs.
7. Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false."

Reasoning:
1. C1 means ""event2 holds at every state"" (globally). That is false in the initial state because initially event3 holds, not event2.
2. Could C1 become true at some future state (so C2 = eventually C1)? For C1 to hold at some state s, every state from s onward must be event2. But from event2 the rules force the next state to be event1 or event3 (no transition 2 -> 2), so it is impossible to have a suffix of the run consisting only of event2 states. Hence C1 is false in every state, so C2 is false.
3. If C2 is never true, then C3 (eventually C2) is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., X event2).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., G C1 — at every state, the next state is event2).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., F G C1 — at some future state, from then on every next state is event2).

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1.
   - From event1 the next must be event3.
   - From event3 the next must be event1. So the system alternates event1 <-> event3 indefinitely (there is no transition from event1 or event3 to event2).
   - When event2 does occur (if it ever could), its next state must be event1 or event3 (so event2 cannot be followed by event2).

3. Evaluate C2 and C3:
   - At the initial state (event1), the next state is event3, so C1 is false there. Thus C2 (which requires C1 at every state) is already false.
   - Could C2 become true at some future state? For G C1 to hold at some state s, s must have its next state = event2, and then at that next state the next state must again be event2, and so on. But if event2 occurs at some state, the following state must be event1 or event3, so you cannot have event2 repeatedly as the next state. Also, event2 is not reachable from event1 or event3, so you cannot reach a state that would make G C1 true.
   - Therefore C2 can never hold at any time, hence C3 (""eventually C2"") is false.

Reasoning:

From the context:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3.

Consider the two possible next states:
1. Next = event2. event2 satisfies C1 at that state, but after event2 the system must go to event3. That future event3 state violates C1, so C2 (always C1) does not hold starting at the next state.

3. From event2, the context allows either event1 or event3 to happen next.
4. There is a possible next choice: event2 -> event3.
5. After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal), so if the system goes event2 -> event3, event1 will never occur.

- But the initial state has event3, so C1 is false (you cannot have ""always event1"" when the initial state is event3).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 in the next state:

5. Thus in the next state C2 simplifies to ""event2"", which is false because the next state is event3.  
6. Therefore C2 does not hold in the next state, so C3 is False.

1. Timeline from the context:
   - State 0 (initial): event2 holds.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → State 1: event1 holds.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → the system stays at event1 forever (all subsequent states have event1).
   - The ""after event3, event2 must happen"" rule is irrelevant because event3 never occurs.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (G event1).
   - G event1 is false at State 0 because event2 holds there (not event1).
   - G event1 is true at State 1 and onward because every future state has event1.
   - So G event1 is not true from the initial state (it does not hold globally starting at State 0).

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (¬G event1).
   - ¬G event1 is true at State 0 (since G event1 is false there).
   - ¬G event1 is false at State 1 and all later states (since G event1 is true from State 1 onward).

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G ¬G event1).

Context implies a forced cycle of events:

- After event2 → event1.

1. Context: Initially event1. After event1, event3 must happen. After event3, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event2 thereafter). Only one event holds in each state.

2. Expand the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., X event3).
   - C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" (i.e., (X event3) ∧ event1) evaluated in the same state.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., X((X event3) ∧ event1)) evaluated in the initial state.

3. Trace from the initial state (event1):
   - From initial (event1), the next state must be event3 (by the rule after event1).
   - Evaluate C2 at that next state (which is event3): C2 requires event1 to hold in that state, but that state is event3, so event1 is false there. Therefore C2 is false in the next state.
   - Since C2 is false in the next state, C3 (which asserts that C2 holds in the next state) is false in the initial state.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from an event1 state the system stays at event1 (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is also terminal.
- After event3, event2 must happen → from event3 the next state would be event2 (and then terminal).

We consider the claims:
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state. At the initial state (event1), the next state must also be event1 (no other events can happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: C1 eventually holds. Since the system stays forever in event1, there is never a state whose next state has event2, so C2 is false.
- C3: C2 holds in the next state. The next state is event1 and C2 is false in all states, so C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: initial state is event1. Transition rules: event1 → event2; event2 → event3; event3 → (event1 or event2).
2. So the timeline starting at the initial state is: event1 (t0) → event2 (t1) → event3 (t2) → either event1 or event2 (t3) → ...
3. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") requires event1 to hold at every time step. But at t1 we have event2, so event1 is false there. Hence C1 is false.
4. C2 is (C1 holds AND event1 happens). Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
5. C3 is (event1 happens AND C2 holds). Because C2 is false, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

1. C3 is the formula: (C2 ⇒ event2) — if C2 holds now, then event2 holds now.
2. C2 is (C1 ∨ event2).
3. C1 is “event1 holds in the next state.”
4. Context: initially event1. After event1 no other events can happen, so the next state (and all future states) also have event1 true. Therefore C1 is true.
5. Since C1 is true, C2 = (C1 ∨ event2) is true.
6. C3 requires that whenever C2 is true, event2 is true. Here C2 is true but the current state has event1 true and event2 false (and from event1 no transition to event2 is possible), so event2 does not hold.
7. Thus the implication C2 ⇒ event2 is false.

1. Initially event2 is true (time 0).
2. From the context rules:
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so time 1 = event1).
   - After event1, event3 must happen (so time 2 = event3).
   - After event3, event1 must happen (so time 3 = event1), and then time 4 = event3, etc.
3. So the infinite sequence of states is: time0: event2, time1: event1, time2: event3, time3: event1, time4: event3, ...
   Event2 never occurs again after time0.
4. C1 is ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time t, C1 means event2 at t+1). Since event2 never occurs at any t+1, C1 is false at every state.

So C3 asks whether Event1 must occur at some future point from the initial state. From the initial state event3, the rules allow either event1 or event2 next. If the system always chooses the non‑Event1 option, we can run: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ... forever (from event2 you may choose event3, from event3 you may choose event2).

Context summary:
- Initial state: event3 is true.
- From event3 the next step must be event1.
- From event1 the next step must be event3.
- From event2 the next step must be event1.

Thus the only allowed transitions from the reachable states event3 and event1 are event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> ... . There is no rule allowing a transition to event2 from either event3 or event1, so event2 can never occur in any reachable future from the initial state.

Now evaluate the hypothesis components at the initial state:
1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is false, because event2 is never reachable.
2. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens (now)."" Both disjuncts are false (C1 is false and event2 does not hold now), so C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 = ""Event2 happens and event3 happens"" — this requires event2 and event3 to be true in the same state. Under the given transition model only one event is true per state (events are mutually exclusive), so C1 is impossible and thus always false.

2. C2 = ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is also always false (it would require all three events true simultaneously).

3. C3 = ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" The initial state has event1 true, but C2 is false there (and everywhere). Therefore the implication is false in the initial state.

   - C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" (i.e., (always X event2) OR event2 (now)).

2. Evaluate at the initial state (initially event1 happened):
   - From the context, after event1 the next state must be either event2 or event3. So from the initial state a next-state of event3 is allowed.
   - Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to hold at the initial state (there is a possible next state where event2 does not occur).
   - Hence C2 (""always C1"") is false — C1 does not hold in all states/paths.

3. Check the second disjunct of C3:
   - At the initial state event2 is not true (initially event1 happened), so ""event2 happens"" is false now.

4. Combine:
   - C3 = C2 OR event2 = false OR false = false.

From the context:
- Initially event2.

- After event1, the next state must be event2.
- After event3, the next state must be event1 or event2.

There is no rule that allows a transition to event3 from either event2 or event1. Starting at event2, the system is forced to alternate event2 → event1 → event2 → ... forever. Therefore:
- Event3 never happens.

Since event3 never occurs, C3 (""Event3 happens and C2 holds"") is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Timeline from the context: state0 = event2 (initial). After event2 → state1 = event3. After event3 → state2 = event1. After event1 → state3 = event3. So the infinite sequence is: 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, ...
2. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So:
   - C1 at state0? No (next state1 = event3) → C1 false at state0.
   - C1 at state1? Yes (next state2 = event1) → C1 true at state1.
3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1 at n+1). Thus:
   - C2 at state0 = C1 at state1 = true.
   - In general, C2 is true at states whose state+2 is event1 (these are even indices 0,2,4,...).
4. C3 = ""C2 holds and event3 happens"" (both at the same state). Event3 occurs only at odd states (1,3,5,...), while C2 holds only at even states (0,2,4,...). They never coincide.

5. C3 is ""Event3 happens and C2 holds"". Since C2 holds, C3 reduces to ""Event3 happens"".

3. C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — both must hold in the same state. But at any given state only one event holds, and event1 never occurs in the run. Thus C1 is always false.

4. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is false at every state, C2 is false.

5. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — C2 never holds, so C3 is false.

1. Write each condition more simply:

   - C2: same, simplifies to Event3.
   - C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" simplifies to Event3 (since C1 and C2 are both Event3).

2. What holds initially? The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So in the initial state:
   - event1 = true
   - event2 = false
   - event3 = false

3. Evaluate C3 in the initial state: C3 is just Event3, which is false initially.

(For completeness: the system transitions cycle 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 ..., so event3 does occur in the next state. But the hypothesis C3 as given is just ""Event3"" at the state being evaluated.)

1. Context (transitions):
   - Initially event2.
   - From event1, next must be event3.
   - From event2, next is either event1 or event3.
   - From event3, next is either event1 or event2.
   (Only one event holds in any given state.)

2. Restate the formulas:
   - C1: event1 or event2.
   - C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. Interpreted as a state implication: (event1 or event2) -> event2.
   - C3: C2 always holds (i.e., C2 must be true in every reachable state).

3. Simplify C2:
   - (event1 or event2) -> event2 is equivalent to (if event1 then event2) (since if event2 holds the implication is trivially true).
   - But two different events cannot hold simultaneously, so when event1 holds, event2 does not — hence C2 is false in any state where event1 holds.

4. Show such a state is reachable:
   - From the initial state event2, one allowed next state is event1 (transition event2 -> event1).
   - In that state event1 holds (so C1 holds) but event2 does not, so C2 is false there.

5. Therefore C2 is not true in all reachable states, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initial state: event3 happens, so C1 (""event1 always happens"") is already false.
- From event3 the next must be event1, and from event1 it's allowed to go to event2. So there is a valid trace: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ...
- In that trace event2 does happen, but C1 is false (because event3 occurred at the initial state).

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is just Event2 (redundant conjunction).
2. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., Event2 must be true in every state (globally).
3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some time from then on Event2 is always true.

From the context:
- Initially event1 is true.

Step 2 — apply the context from the initial state s0:
- Initially s0: event1 holds.
- After event1, event3 must happen → s1: event3.
- After event3, no other events can happen → once at event3, all later states are event3 (so s2, s3, ... are event3).

Step 3 — evaluate C3 at the initial state s0:
- The first conjunct of C3 requires event3 at s0, but s0 is event1 → this is false.
- Even though event3 holds at s1 and s2, the conjunct ""event3 happens now"" is false, so C3 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 is the proposition ""Event2 happens and Event3 happens"" (both true in the same state). C2 is identical to C1, and C3 is C1 and C2, so C3 is equivalent to C1.
2. The context states the initial state has Event3 true.
3. After Event3, no other events can happen — so once in an Event3 state the system remains with Event3 and cannot move to a state where Event2 also holds.
4. At most one event holds in a single state, and there is no state where Event2 and Event3 are simultaneously true.
5. Therefore C1 is false (and so are C2 and C3).

1. Initially event3 is true.
2. C1 is ""Event3 always happens"" — i.e., from the current state onward every state must have event3.
3. But the context says: after event3, event2 must happen. So the immediate next state after any event3 state's is event2 (not event3). Therefore C1 is false in any state where event3 occurs (because it would require the next state to also be event3, which it cannot be).
4. C2 is ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" In any state where event3 is true this implication requires C1 to hold; since C1 is false in such a state, C2 is false in every state that contains event3.
5. The initial state has event3, so C2 is false in the initial state.
6. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., C2 must be true in every state. Because C2 is false in the initial state, C3 is false.

1. The context gives the initial state: event2 is true.
2. The transitions force a deterministic sequence:
   - After event2 occurs, event3 must happen (so next state: event3).
   - After event3, event1 must happen (next state: event1).
   - After event1, event3 must happen (next state: event3), so the sequence after the initial state cycles: event3, event1, event3, event1, ...

4. From the context: initial state = event2. Transitions: 2 → 3 (must), and from 3 you may choose either 1 or 2. If from every occurrence of 3 we always choose 2, the system follows the infinite loop 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → … and Event1 never occurs.
5. Along that execution, ""eventually Event1"" is false, so C2 does not hold in the initial state (and thus C2 is not always true).

2. C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" = there is some future state whose immediate next state is event3.  
3. C3: ""Eventually C2 holds"" (equivalent to C2 for eventualities).

5. Consider the allowed run event2 -> event1 -> event1 -> ... In that run the next state after the initial event2 is event1 (not event3), and from then on no transition to event3 ever occurs. Hence C1 never holds in that run, so C2 and C3 are false on that run.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret events as state labels (only one event true per state). So C1 = (event2 AND event3) requires both to hold in the same state — impossible. Therefore C1 is always false.

2. C2 = (C1) OR event2. Since C1 is always false, C2 simplifies to event2 (C2 holds exactly in those states where event2 holds).

3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" asks whether every state satisfies event2. Starting from the initial state event2, after event2 the system may go to event1 or event3 (by the context). Thus there are reachable states where event1 or event3 holds, so not every state has event2.

Starting from the initial state, the only forced behavior is:
event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... (they alternate forever). Event2 never appears in this trace.

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" means event3 must hold in every state. In the alternating trace, some states are event1 states, so event3 does not hold there. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also false.

2. This yields the (forced) infinite alternating trace:

   Event2 is never reached from the given initial state and rules.

3. Interpret the formulas:

   - C2: ""Event3 happens (now) and C1 holds"" i.e. current state is event3 AND the next state is event3 (two consecutive event3 states).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" i.e. there exists some state with two consecutive event3 states.

4. Check where C2 could hold on the trace:
   - At any state with event3 (s1, s3, ...), the next state is event1, so C1 is false there; thus C2 is false.
   - At any state with event1, C2 is false because current event is not event3.

   - From event2 the next state must be event1.

2. Understand the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — means every state must have event3.
   - C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" — requires the current state has event3 and globally event3 holds.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C2 is true at S1 (the state immediately after the initial state).

3. Evaluate at S1:
   - S1 is event1 (because after event3 the next state must be event1), so event3 does not hold at S1.
   - Therefore C2 is false at S1 (it requires event3 at that state).
   - Hence C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is false at the initial state.

1. Interpret the system: states represent which single event ""happened"" at that time. From the context:
   - Initially event3 is true (initial state = event3).
   - After event3, no other events can happen → event3 is a sink (next state must also be event3).
   - After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is a sink.
   - After event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3.

2. C1 = (event3 AND event2). That requires both event3 and event2 to be true in the same state. But in this model only one event can hold in a state, so C1 is always false.

1. Context transitions:
   - Initially: event1 (state e1).
   - From e1, next must be e3.
   - From e3, next is either e1 or e2 (nondeterministic choice).
   - From e2, next must be e1.

2. Interpret the claims:
   - C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — i.e., from a given state, there will be some future state where event1 holds.
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state along the run, from that state event1 will eventually happen.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2 (there is some state from which event1 does not eventually occur).

3. Check C1 from every possible state:
   - From e1: event1 already holds, so C1 is true.
   - From e2: next state must be e1, so event1 happens immediately — C1 true.
   - From e3: next is either e1 (then event1 happens next) or e2 (then e2 → e1, so event1 happens in two steps). Both choices lead to event1 within at most two steps — C1 true.

4. Therefore in any state where event1 holds, the antecedent of C2 is true but the consequent is false, so C2 is false in that state.

- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e., event3 ⇒ event2, evaluated in a single state)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of the state-level implication)
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" (C2 ∧ event1 in a single state)

Step 2 — note how states work
Only one event holds in any given state (as in the examples). The initial state has event3 true. Transition rules:
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 happens.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 happens.

Step 3 — check possibilities
- In any state where event3 is true, C1 is false (because event3 true but event2 false), so C2 is true there — but event1 is false in that state. Thus C3 (C2 ∧ event1) is false in event3 states.
- In any state where event1 is true, event3 is false, so the implication event3 ⇒ event2 is vacuously true; therefore C1 is true, C2 is false. So C3 is false in event1 states.
- In event2 states, event3 is false so C1 is true and C2 is false; also event1 is false. So C3 is false in event2 states.

There is no state where both C2 and event1 are true simultaneously.

Context rules:
- Initially: event2.
- From event2 → next must be event1.
- From event1 → next is event2 or event3.
- From event3 → next must be event1.

Interpretation of the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e., the current state is not event2 (so it's event1 or event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists a future state where event2 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — it is not true that eventually there is a state where event2 does not happen.

Trace from the initial state:
1. Initial state: event2 (so C1 is false now).
2. By the rule after event2, the next state must be event1. In that next state event2 does not happen, so C1 holds at the next state.
3. Thus C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true (it already holds in the next state).
4. Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

1. Initially event1 is true.
2. After event1, event3 must happen → next state: event3.
3. After event3, event2 must happen → next state: event2.
4. After event2, event1 must happen → next state: event1.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This would require that at some point onward event2 is true in every future state. Because the behavior is a repeating 3-state cycle containing event1 and event3, there is no suffix where event2 holds at every state. So C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is (event3 -> event2).
2. C2 is (event3 -> C1) = (event3 -> (event3 -> event2)). For any booleans p,q, p -> (p -> q) is equivalent to p -> q, so C2 is logically equivalent to C1.
3. Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is equivalent to ""C1 does not hold"".
4. From the context: initially event2. After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. So there is a reachable state where event3 occurs (the transition choosing event3).
5. In a state where event3 occurs, event2 is not true simultaneously (events are exclusive in a single state). Thus in that state event3 is true but event2 is false, so C1 (event3 -> event2) is false.
6. Since C1 is false in the model, C2 is false, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true."

1. C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreting this as ""event2 is false in the current (initial) state"" — in the initial state event1 happened, so event2 is false. Thus C1 holds in the initial state.
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ¬C1. Since C1 holds, C2 is false in the initial state.
   (Even if C1 were read as ""event2 never happens"", the context forces an alternating 1↔3 loop so event2 never occurs, making C1 true and C2 false as well.)

1. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., Event1 holds in every state).
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — equivalently, at the next state C1 (Event1 always) must be true.
3. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — equivalently, at the state one step ahead, C2 must be true (so at two steps ahead C1 must hold).

Now use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""event3 does not happen"" (¬event3).
2. C2 is ""if event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — that is event3 → ¬event3, which simplifies to ¬event3 (because event3 → ¬event3 ≡ ¬event3).
3. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"", so C3 requires that in the immediate successor state ¬event3 is true (i.e., the next state is not event3).
4. From the context: initially event2, and after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen. Thus an immediate successor may be event3 (the choice is allowed).
5. Because a next state with event3 is possible, ¬event3 need not hold in the next state on all executions. Therefore C3 is not guaranteed.

So C3 is False."
