</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, we need to determine if C3 is true or false. C3 states that C2 always holds, where C2 is defined as ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"", and C1 is ""event2 eventually happens"".

In temporal logic, ""eventually"" includes the current state. Therefore, if event2 happens at a state, then C1 is immediately true at that state because event2 has occurred. Thus, the implication ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is always true at every state: if event2 is true, C1 is true, and if event2 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Considering the event sequences from the context:
- Initially, event1 occurs.
- From event1, the system moves to either event2 or event3.
- After event2, no other events happen, so the system stays at event2.
- After event3, no other events happen, so the system stays at event3.

In both possible sequences:
- Sequence A: event1 → event2 → event2 → ...
- Sequence B: event1 → event3 → event3 → ...

At every state in both sequences, C2 is true because:
- In states where event2 occurs, C1 is true.
- In states where event2 does not occur, the implication is true since the antecedent is false.

Therefore, C2 always holds, meaning C3 is true.

- After event2, event1 must happen, so the sequence proceeds to event1.
- After event1, event3 must happen, so the sequence proceeds to event3.
- After event3, event1 must happen, leading to a cycle between event1 and event3.

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 and event3 happen. Since only one event occurs per state, C1 is always false.
- C2: C1 holds or event3 happens. Since C1 is always false, C2 simplifies to ""event3 happens"".
- C3: If event1 happens, then C2 holds. This means that whenever event1 occurs in a state, C2 must be true in that same state. Since C2 requires event3 to happen in the same state, but event1 and event3 cannot occur simultaneously in any state, C3 is false.

In the sequence, when event1 occurs (e.g., after event2 or after event3), event3 does not occur in the same state. Therefore, C3 is never satisfied.

- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events happen.

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen. This means that in the current state, event2 is false.
- C2: C1 does not hold. Since C1 is ""event2 does not happen"", C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" in the current state.
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds. This means that whenever event2 is true in a state, C2 must be true in that state.

In the sequence:
- At time t=1, event2 happens. At this state, C2 is ""event2 happens"", which is true. Thus, when event2 happens, C2 holds.
- At other states, event2 does not happen, so the implication in C3 is vacuously true.

The context specifies that initially, event1 happened. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. This means that in all possible sequences, event1 occurs repeatedly because:
- The sequence starts with event1.
- After event2, the system always returns to event1.
- After event3, the system may go to event1 or event2, but if it goes to event2, it then goes to event1.

Thus, event1 happens in every possible sequence. Therefore, the consequent of C3 (event1 happens) is always true, making the implication ""if C2 holds, then event1 happens"" always true regardless of whether C2 holds or not.

- The context states that initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

C1 is defined as ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as a state formula, C1 holds in a state if and only if event3 does not happen in that state. This is because if event3 happens, event1 cannot happen simultaneously (only one event per state), making the implication false. If event3 does not happen, the implication is true vacuously.

C2 states that ""C1 eventually holds,"" meaning there exists some future state where C1 is true, i.e., where event3 does not happen.

Initially, event3 happens, so C1 is false. However, after event3, event2 must happen. In the state where event2 happens, event3 does not happen, so C1 is true. Therefore, C1 eventually holds, making C2 true.

C3 states ""C2 holds or event3 happens."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true regardless of event3.

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

This leads to cyclic sequences: event1 → event2 → event3 → event1 → ... or event1 → event3 → event1 → ... .

Now, consider C1: event3 happens or event2 happens. C1 is true in any state where event2 or event3 occurs.

C2: C1 eventually holds, meaning that from any state, there is some future state where C1 is true.

C3: C2 always holds, meaning that from every state, C2 is true.

- From a state where event1 occurs, the next state must be event2 or event3, so C1 holds in the next state. Thus, C2 is true from event1.
- From a state where event2 occurs, C1 holds immediately since event2 occurs, so C2 is true.
- From a state where event3 occurs, C1 holds immediately since event3 occurs, so C2 is true.

Therefore, from every possible state, C2 is true, meaning C3 holds.

C1 is true when either event1 or event3 occurs. Therefore, C1 is false only when event2 occurs (since only one event happens at a time). Thus, C2 is true only when event2 occurs.

From the context, initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore, in the state following event1, event2 occurs. At this state, event2 is true, so C1 is false, meaning C2 is true.

Since C2 is true in this state, C3 (C2 eventually holds) is true.

Even if the sequence continues, event2 will occur multiple times (e.g., after event1 or after event3 followed by event1), so C2 will hold repeatedly. Thus, C3 is true.

- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

From any state, event1 eventually happens:
- If the current state is event1, then event1 has already happened, so C1 holds.
- If the current state is event2, then event1 must happen next (since after event2, event1 must happen), so event1 eventually happens.
- If the current state is event3, then either event1 or event2 must happen next. If event1 happens next, then event1 occurs. If event2 happens next, then event1 must happen after event2, so event1 eventually occurs.

Thus, from every state, event1 eventually happens, meaning C1 always holds. Therefore, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. Since C2 is true, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also true.

  - In the initial state (event2), C1 is false.
  - In state event1, C1 is true.
  - In state event3, C1 is true.
- C2: C1 eventually holds. This means that from any state, there is a future state where C1 is true.

  - From state event1, C1 is already true, so C2 holds.

- The hypothesis includes:
  - C1: Event1 does not happen.
  - C2: C1 eventually holds, meaning that eventually, event1 does not happen.
  - C3: If event1 happens, then C2 holds.

In the cycle, whenever event1 happens, the next event is event3. During event3, event1 does not happen, so C1 is true at that state. Therefore, after event1, C1 becomes true in the very next state, meaning that C2 (C1 eventually holds) is true immediately after event1.

Thus, for any state where event1 happens, C2 holds because event1 does not happen in the next state. Therefore, C3 is true.

The presence of event2 does not change this reasoning, as after event2, event3 happens, and event1 does not happen during event3, so C1 holds. But since C3 depends only on the condition when event1 happens, and event1 always leads to event3 where C1 holds, C3 remains true.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event2.

The possible sequences are:
- Sequence A: event3 → event1 → event2 → event2 → ...
- Sequence B: event3 → event2 → event2 → ...

In both sequences, event2 eventually happens from every state:
- From the initial state (event3), event2 eventually happens because either event1 or event2 follows, and event1 leads to event2.
- From the event1 state, event2 must happen next.
- From the event2 state, event2 is already true, so ""eventually happens"" is satisfied.

Therefore, C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true at every state. Since C1 is always true, C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is always true regardless of event3. Thus, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

In the event sequence, only one event occurs at a time. Thus, whenever event1 happens, event3 cannot happen simultaneously because only one event is true per state. This means that whenever event1 happens, C1 (event3 does not happen) is automatically true. Since event1 is true, C2 is also true.

The event sequences confirm that event1 occurs repeatedly (e.g., after event2, event1 happens, and after event3, event2 happens followed by event1). In every state where event1 happens, C2 holds. Therefore, the implication in C3 is always satisfied.

- C2 is defined as ""C1 eventually holds,"" and C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- The context specifies that after event3, event2 must happen, and after event2, no other events can happen.
- There are two possible sequences:
  - Sequence 1: event1 → event2 (and stops at event2).
  - Sequence 2: event1 → event3 → event2 (and stops at event2).
- In sequences where event3 never happens (Sequence 1), the implication ""if event3 happens"" is false, so C3 is vacuously true.
- In sequences where event3 happens (Sequence 2), after event3, event2 must occur. When event2 occurs, C1 is true because event2 happens, so C1 eventually holds. Thus, C2 holds when event3 happens, making the implication true.
- Therefore, in all possible sequences, C3 is true.

- If event2 happens in S1, then C2 holds at S1 because C2 requires that if event3 happens, then C1 holds. Since event2 happens, the condition ""if event3 happens"" is false, so C2 is true regardless of C1.
- If event3 happens in S1, then for C2 to hold at S1, C1 must hold at S1. C1 requires that event2 happens in the next state (S2). According to the context, after event3, event2 must happen, so in S2, event2 must happen. Thus, C1 holds at S1, and C2 holds at S1.

In both cases, C2 holds at S1. Therefore, for S0, C3 (which requires that C2 holds in the next state) is true.

- C1 states that event1 happens in the next state.
- C2 states that C1 always holds, meaning in every state, the next state must be event1.
- However, the context specifies that after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen, meaning event1 cannot be followed by event1. Additionally, after event3, event2 must happen, meaning event3 cannot be followed by event1. Therefore, it is impossible for C2 to hold because from event1 or event3, the next state cannot be event1.
- Since C2 is always false, C3 (which states that C2 does not hold) is True.

Thus, C3 is True.

C1 states that event3 and event1 happen, which is true in this sequence. Similarly, C2 states the same thing, so it is also true. C3 is a logical implication: if C1 holds, then C2 holds. Since both C1 and C2 are true, the implication is always true.

- C2 states that ""C1 always holds."" This is a temporal formula, meaning that in every state of the sequence, C1 must be true (i.e., event2 never happens).
- C3 states that ""C2 does not hold,"" meaning that it is not true that C1 always holds (i.e., event2 happens at least once).

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened, so in the initial state, event2 is true, meaning C1 is false.
- After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen. This creates a cycle where event2 occurs repeatedly.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen, and both lead to event2 occurring eventually.

Since event2 happens in the initial state and continues to occur in the cycle, C1 is false in states where event2 is true. Therefore, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 does not hold in all states.

Since C2 is false, C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. Therefore, from the initial state (where event1 occurred), the next event must be event3.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen, meaning that event3 does not happen in the next state after event3.

Thus, when we reach a state where event3 has occurred, C1 is false (because the next event is not event3), so C2 is true. Since we always reach event3 from the initial event1, C2 eventually holds in every possible sequence. Therefore, C3 is true.

- The initial state is event3.
- After event3, event2 must happen, so the next state is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so all subsequent states remain event2.
- Event1 never occurs in this sequence.

Now, consider the conditions:
- C1: Event3 happens in the next state. This means C1 is true only if the next state is event3.
- C2: C1 does not hold. So, C2 is true when C1 is false.
- C3: C2 always holds. This means C2 must be true at every state.

In the sequence:
- At state0 (event3): The next state is event2, so C1 is false. Thus, C2 is true.
- At state1 (event2): The next state is event2, so C1 is false. Thus, C2 is true.
- At all subsequent states (event2): The next state is always event2, so C1 is always false. Thus, C2 is always true.

- In all possible sequences, event2 eventually happens and the system stays at event2. However, event3 may or may not happen depending on the path: if the sequence is event1 → event2, event3 never happens; if the sequence is event1 → event3 → event2, both event3 and event2 happen.

- C2 is defined as ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since event2 always happens eventually in all sequences, the conclusion ""event2 happens"" is always true. Therefore, regardless of whether C1 is true or false, the implication ""if C1 then event2"" is always true. Thus, C2 is always true.

- C1 is defined as ""event3 happens or event3 happens"", which simplifies to ""event3 happens"". Since event3 never occurs in the cycle, C1 is always false.
- C2 is defined as ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"". This means that in any state where event1 happens, C1 must be true.

Since event2 happens initially, the first part of C3 is satisfied. Now, we need to check if C2 holds, i.e., if C1 eventually holds.

From the transitions:
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. Therefore, immediately after event2, there is a state where event1 or event3 occurs, meaning event2 does not happen in that state. Thus, C1 holds in the next state after event2.

Therefore, C2 holds because C1 eventually holds (in the very next state). Since both conditions for C3 are satisfied, C3 is true.

- If event1 happens immediately after event3, then event1 occurs.
- If event2 happens after event3, then after event2, event1 must happen, so event1 occurs eventually.
- Therefore, event1 always happens eventually in the sequence.

Now, examining the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means that event1 eventually happens, which is true as established.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means that the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" eventually holds. Since C2 is true from the point after event3, C3 is also true.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" means that event2 must be true in every state. However, since event2 only occurs initially and never again in subsequent states, C1 is false.

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means that C1 must be true in every state. Since C1 is false (as event2 does not always happen), C2 is also false.

However, from the context:

- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Therefore, after event1 occurs, event3 happens immediately, but then event2 must follow after event3.

In the given event sequences:
- Initially, event2 happened, so at time t=0, event3 has not happened, meaning both C1 and C2 hold. Thus, C3 holds at t=0.
- After event2, event3 must happen, so from t=1 onward, event3 happens, meaning both C1 and C2 are false. When C1 is false, the implication ""if C1 holds, then C2 holds"" is automatically true.

The context specifies:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

The possible event sequences are:
- Sequence 1: event3 → event1. In this sequence, event2 never happens.
- Sequence 2: event3 → event2 → event1. In this sequence, event2 happens only in the second state, but not in the first or third state.

In both sequences, event2 does not happen in every state. Therefore, C1 does not always hold, meaning C2 is false. Since C2 is false, C3 (which asserts that C2 does not hold) is true.

- The hypothesis defines C1 as ""Event3 happens in the next state"" and C2 as ""Event3 happens in the next state"". Therefore, C1 and C2 are identical statements.
- C3 is defined as ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"". Since C1 and C2 are the same, this implication is always true. In logic, if P implies P, it is a tautology, meaning it holds regardless of the actual events.
- Thus, for any state in any event sequence, if C1 holds (meaning event3 happens in the next state), then C2 necessarily holds, and if C1 does not hold, the implication is still true because the antecedent is false.

C3 requires that C2 holds in the next state. Since the system does not transition to any new state and remains at event3, the next state is identical to the current state, where C2 is true. Therefore, C2 holds in the next state, making C3 true.

Initially, event3 has happened. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. If event1 happens, then no other events occur, and both event3 and event1 have happened, so C1 holds, making C2 true and C3 false. However, if after event3, event2 happens, then event3 must happen again. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, with event2 always being chosen after event3, so event1 never happens. In this case, event1 never occurs, so C1 never holds, meaning C2 is false, and thus C3 is true.

Since there is a possible sequence where event1 never happens, C2 does not hold, so C3 is true.

Initially, event2 happened. From event2, the system must move to either event1 or event3. After event1 or event3, no other events happen, so the system remains in event1 or event3 indefinitely.

At the initial state (t=0), event2 is true. The next state (t=1) will have either event1 or event3, meaning event2 does not happen at t=1. Therefore, C1 holds at t=1, so C2 holds at t=0.

Since C2 holds at the initial state, C3 (C2 eventually holds) is true. Moreover, in all subsequent states, event2 never happens again, so C2 remains true throughout.

Thus, C3 is true.

- The initial state is event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- This creates a cycle between event1 and event2: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
- Event3 never occurs in this cycle because the only way to trigger event3 is from itself, but it never starts since the initial event is event1.

Now, evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens."" Since event3 never happens, C1 is true only in states where event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This means that in the current state, C1 must be true in the next state.
  - In states where event1 occurs, the next state is event2, and in event2, C1 is false (since event1 and event3 are false). Thus, C2 is false in event1 states.
  - In states where event2 occurs, the next state is event1, and in event1, C1 is true. Thus, C2 is true in event2 states.

Therefore, C2 is true only in states where event2 occurs.

C3 states that if C2 holds, then event3 must happen. However, in states where event2 occurs (where C2 is true), event3 does not happen. Thus, there are states where C2 is true but event3 is false, making the implication false.

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

This leads to a sequence: event2 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... and so on. Event1 occurs infinitely often in this sequence.

C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true at every state because:
- From event2, event1 occurs after event3.
- From event3, event1 occurs immediately after.
- From event1, event1 is already true or will occur again in the future.

Since C1 is true at every state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also true at every state. Therefore, when event2 happens (as in the initial state), C2 holds. Thus, C3 is true.

In this sequence, event1 always happens, so C1 (event1 happens or event2 happens) is always true because event1 happens. Thus, C2 (C1 always holds) is true for the entire sequence.

C3 requires that C2 holds in the next state. Since the next state is also event1 and C2 remains true (as C1 always holds from any state in the sequence), C3 is true.

Therefore, C3 is True.

Initially, event3 happened, so at the initial state, C1 is true because event3 is true. Since C1 is true at the initial state, C2 (which requires that C1 eventually holds) is immediately true.

No matter what sequence of events follows from the initial state, C1 holds at least at the initial state, ensuring that C2 and C3 are true.

Thus, in every state, event3 does not happen in the next state, meaning C1 and C2 are always false. However, even though C1 is always false, the implication ""if C1 holds, then C2 holds"" remains true because a false premise makes the implication true.

Therefore, C3 is always true.

- Initially, event1 happened at time t=0.
- After event1, event3 must happen, so at time t=1, event3 occurs.
- After event3, no other events can happen, so from t=1 onward, event3 remains true.

Now, evaluating C2 at each state:
- At t=0: The next state (t=1) has event3, so event1 does not happen. Thus, C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is true at t=0.
- At t=1: The next state (t=2) has event3, so event1 does not happen. Thus, C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is true at t=1.
- Similarly, for all subsequent states, the next state always has event3, so event1 never happens in any next state. Therefore, C2 is always true.

Initially, event1 happened. After event1, event3 must happen, so the next state after the initial state is event3. After event3, no other events can happen, so the system remains in event3 indefinitely. Therefore, the sequence of events is: state0 (event1) → state1 (event3) → state2 (event3) → ... 

Now, evaluate C1 for each state:
- At state0, C1 requires that event1 happens in the next state (state1). However, state1 has event3, so C1 is false.
- At state1, C1 requires that event1 happens in the next state (state2). But state2 has event3, so C1 is false.
- Similarly, for all subsequent states, C1 is false because event1 never occurs again.

Since C1 is false in every state, C2 (which requires C1 to always hold) is false. Therefore, C3 (which states that C2 does not hold) is true.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 occurs.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must occur.
- After event1, event3 must occur.
- After event2, no other events occur.

This means that whenever event1 occurs, the next event must be event3. Therefore, it is impossible for event1 to occur in two consecutive states.

- The context ensures that if C2 holds, event3 has indeed happened, making the implication true.

- The system starts with event1 true.
- After event1, event2 must happen, meaning the next state has event2 true.
- After event2, event1 must happen, meaning the next state has event1 true.
- This creates a cycle between event1 and event2. Event3 never occurs because there is no transition to it from event1 or event2.

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen. This means that in a state where event2 is false, C1 is true.
- C2: C1 eventually holds. This means that from any state, there is some future state where C1 is true.
- C3: C2 always holds. This means that in every state, C2 is true.

In the cycle:
- When event1 is true, event2 is false, so C1 is true at that state.
- When event2 is true, event1 is false, but from there, the next state has event1 true, so C1 becomes true in the next state.

Thus, from any state:
- If the current state has event1 true, then C1 is true immediately, so C2 (C1 eventually holds) is true.
- If the current state has event2 true, then in the next state, C1 is true, so C2 is true.

Therefore, C2 is true in every state, meaning C2 always holds. Hence, C3 is true.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, we need to evaluate C3: ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds.""

First, simplify C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is again ""event2 happens"".

Thus, C2 simply means ""event2 happens"" in any state.

C3 states: ""If event3 happens, then C2 holds."" This means that whenever event3 occurs in a state, C2 must hold in that same state. However, C2 holding requires event2 to happen in that state. But according to the context, only one event can happen in any state. Therefore, when event3 happens, event2 cannot happen in the same state, so C2 cannot hold. Thus, the implication ""if event3 happens, then C2 holds"" is always false because the antecedent (event3 happens) is true and the consequent (C2 holds) is false.

Therefore, C3 is false.

The context states that initially, event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore, in all possible sequences, event1 occurs immediately after the initial event2. This means that event1 eventually happens in every sequence, so C1 is always true. Since C1 is always true, C2 is always true. Thus, C3 is always true because C2 holds.

- The initial state is event1.
- From event1, either event2 or event3 can happen.
- From event2, event1 must happen.
- From event3, event2 must happen.

C1 is ""event3 does not happen"".  
C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", meaning that at some future point, event3 does not happen.  
C3 is ""C2 always holds"", meaning that from every state in the sequence, C2 is true (i.e., from every state, eventually event3 does not happen).

Now, consider the possible sequences:
- If from event1, we always go to event2, then event3 never happens. Thus, C1 is always true, so C2 is always true.
- If from event1, we go to event3, then at event3, C1 is false. However, from event3, we must go to event2, where event3 does not happen (so C1 is true). Then from event2, we go to event1, where event3 does not happen. Thus, from event3, we eventually reach a state where C1 is true, so C2 is true from event3. Similarly, from event2 or event1, C1 is true immediately or eventually.

Therefore, from every state in any sequence, C1 eventually holds. This means C2 is always true, so C3 is true.

Thus, C3 is True.

At the initial state (S0: event2), the next state (S1) must be event3, as per the context (after event2, event3 must happen).

At S1 (event3), we need C2 to hold for C3 to be true at S0. C2 at S1 means that C1 holds in the next state after S1 (i.e., at S2). C1 requires that event3 does not happen at S2.

From the context, after event3 (S1), either event1 or event2 must happen at S2. Both event1 and event2 are not event3, so event3 does not happen at S2. Therefore, C1 holds at S2, meaning C2 holds at S1.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

If event2 happens, the next event must be event1, not event3. Therefore, at the state where event2 happens, C1 is false because the next event is event1, not event3. Since C1 is false at that state, C2 cannot hold because C2 requires C1 to be true in every state. Thus, if event2 happens, C2 does not hold.

Since there are possible sequences where event2 happens (e.g., after event3, we can choose event2), and in those sequences, C2 does not hold when event2 happens, C3 is false for those sequences. Therefore, C3 is not true for all possible sequences in the system.

- C1 states that event3 does not happen. This means that in any state where C1 holds, event3 is false.
- C2 states that C1 holds and event1 happens. This means that in any state where C2 holds, event1 is true and event3 is false.
- C3 states that if event2 happens, then C2 holds. This means that whenever event2 is true in a state, C2 must be true in that same state.

In the given system, only one event can be true at a time. When event2 happens, event2 is true in that state. For C2 to hold in that state, event1 must be true and event3 must be false. However, if event2 is true, event1 cannot be true simultaneously because only one event is true per state. Therefore, when event2 happens, event1 is false, so C2 does not hold.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, we need to determine if C3 is true or false. C3 states that ""C2 does not hold,"" where C2 is ""C1 eventually holds,"" and C1 is ""Event3 always happens.""

- The initial state is event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen, and after event3, event2 must happen, leading to an alternating sequence between event2 and event3.
- Event1 never occurs in this sequence because there is no transition from event2 or event3 to event1.
- In this sequence, event3 happens intermittently but not always. From any state, there is always a future state where event3 is false (when event2 occurs).
- Therefore, C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is never true in any state.
- Since C1 is never true, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is always false.
- Since C2 is always false, C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Thus, C3 is True.

- C2 is defined as ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 is defined as ""Event1 happens and event3 happens.""
- Therefore, C2 simplifies to ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" (since C1 requires event1 and event3).

Thus, C3 means that whenever event3 occurs, event1 must also occur at the same time (i.e., in the same state).

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

The events occur sequentially, meaning only one event can happen in any state. Therefore, it is impossible for both event1 and event3 to happen simultaneously in the same state.

Additionally, from the initial state (event2), the sequence alternates between event2 and event3 indefinitely. There is no rule that allows event1 to occur from event2 or event3, so event1 never happens in any state.

Since event3 occurs (e.g., after event2) but event1 never occurs, C2 is always false. Therefore, when event3 happens, C2 does not hold, making C3 false.

Initially, event1 happened at state S0. From event1, the next state S1 must be either event2 or event3. After event2, no other events can happen, so subsequent states remain event2. After event3, event2 must happen, so from S1=event3, S2=event2, and then states remain event2.

Thus, in all possible sequences:
- Sequence A: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event2, ...
- Sequence B: S0: event1, S1: event3, S2: event2, ...

Now, evaluate C3 at S0. C3 at S0 requires that at S1, C2 holds. C2 at S1 requires that at S2, C1 holds (i.e., event1 does not happen). In both sequences, at S2, event2 happens, so event1 does not happen. Therefore, C1 holds at S2, so C2 holds at S1. Thus, C3 is true at S0.

Therefore, C3 is True.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

The possible event sequences always include states where event3 occurs. For example:
- Sequence 1: event3 → event2 → event1 → event3 → ...
- Sequence 2: event3 → event2 → event3 → ...

In any state where event3 is true, event1 and event2 are false, so C1 is false. Since event3 occurs in the initial state and repeatedly in all sequences, there are always states where C1 is false. Therefore, C1 does not always hold, meaning C2 is false.

Since C2 is false, C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Thus, C3 is True.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

When event1 happens, the next state must be event2 (as per ""after event1, event2 must happen""). In the state where event2 happens, event3 does not happen. Therefore, C1 (event3 does not happen) holds in the next state after event1. Thus, C2 holds whenever event1 happens, meaning C3 is true.

This holds for all sequences starting from event1, as the transition from event1 to event2 is deterministic and ensures event3 does not occur in the next state.

After event3, no other events happen, but event3 itself is true, so C3 remains true. Therefore, C3 is true in every possible state.

Thus, C3 is always true.

- Event1 never occurs in this sequence because the cycle starts from event3 and continues between event2 and event3.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen, meaning once event1 occurs, it remains event1 indefinitely.

Consider the sequence of events:
- Start with event3.
- After event3, event1 must happen, so we transition to event1.
- After event1, we stay at event1 forever.

Now, when event1 happens, we check C3: if event1 happens, then C2 must hold. C2 requires that in the next state, C1 holds. However, after event1, the next state is also event1. In a state where event1 happens, C1 is false because event1 implies event3, but event3 does not occur simultaneously with event1. Therefore, in the next state (which is event1), C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Thus, when event1 happens, C2 does not hold, meaning C3 is false.

No other sequences are possible from the context, as event2 never occurs. Therefore, C3 is always false in all possible sequences.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, we need to determine if C3 is true. C3 states that C2 does not hold, meaning C2 is false at every state.

- The context starts with event1, and after event1, no other events can happen. Therefore, the system remains in event1 indefinitely, and event3 never occurs.
- C1 is defined as ""event1 happens in the next state."" Since the system always transitions to event1, C1 is always true.
- C2 requires both C1 to hold and event3 to happen. However, event3 never happens, so C2 is always false.
- Since C2 is always false, C2 does not hold at any state, so C3 is true.

Thus, C3 is True.

- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events happen, so the sequence stabilizes at event3.

The event sequence is: event2 → event1 → event3 → event3 → ...

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" simplifies to ""Event3 happens or Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means that at some point in the sequence, either event1 or event3 must be true.

In the sequence:
- At the initial state (event2), event1 and event3 are false, so C2 is false.
- At the next state (after event2), event1 occurs, so C2 is true because event1 happens.

Since C2 becomes true in the state immediately after the initial state, C3 (C2 eventually holds) is true.

In the given system:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event2 indefinitely.
- There are no rules that allow transitioning to event1 from any state, as event2 is terminal and no other events can occur from event2.
- Therefore, event1 never happens in this system.

Since event1 never happens, the antecedent of C3 (""event1 happens"") is always false. In logic, an implication with a false antecedent is always true, regardless of the consequent. Thus, C3 is true vacuously.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, we need to determine if C3 is true or false. C3 states that ""C2 always holds,"" where C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds,"" and C1 is ""Event3 eventually happens.""

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

The possible sequences of events show that event3 occurs repeatedly. Specifically:
- From the initial event2, event3 occurs at the next step.
- After event3, if event1 occurs, then event3 must occur next; if event2 occurs, then event3 must occur next.
- Thus, event3 occurs at every odd time step (e.g., time 1, 3, 5, ...) after the initial state.

Therefore, from any state in the sequence, event3 eventually happens in the future. This means that C1 holds at every state.

Since C1 holds at every state, the implication ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., C2) is always true, regardless of whether event2 occurs at a state. If event2 occurs, C1 holds; if event2 does not occur, the implication is vacuously true.

Thus, C2 holds at every state, meaning C3 is true.

- C3 is defined as ""C2 eventually holds"", meaning that at some point in the sequence, C2 is true, i.e., there exists a state where the next state has event2.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events happen, so the system remains in event2.

In all possible sequences:
- If event1 transitions directly to event2, then at the initial state (event1), the next state is event2, so C2 holds immediately.
- If event1 transitions to event3, then at event3, the next state is event2, so C2 holds at event3.
- Once event2 is reached, the next state is always event2, so C2 holds continuously from that point onward.

The context specifies that initially, event2 happened, and after event2, no other events can happen. This means that the system remains in a state where only event2 occurs, and no further events, including event1 or event3, can occur. Therefore, event1 never happens in any state.

Since event1 never happens, the condition ""if event1 happens"" in C2 is always false. In logic, an implication with a false antecedent is always true. Thus, C2 holds in every state because the antecedent is never satisfied.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so if event1 occurs, it remains true.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Now, consider when event2 happens:
- After event2, event3 must occur in the next state.
- When event3 occurs, C1 is true because event3 is one of the conditions in C1 (event3 or event1).
- Therefore, after event2, event3 always happens, making C1 true in the next state. Thus, C1 eventually holds (immediately after event2), so C2 holds.

This holds true regardless of the sequence after event3. If from event3 we go to event1, C1 is true immediately. If from event3 we go to event2, then event3 will occur again after event2, keeping C1 true whenever event3 occurs. Thus, in all cases where event2 happens, C2 eventually holds.

Therefore, C3 is true.

- C3 states: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.
- C2 is defined as: C1 holds or event1 happens.
- C1 is defined as: Event2 happens and event3 happens.

Since only one event can occur in any single state, C1 is always false because event2 and event3 cannot happen simultaneously. Therefore, C2 simplifies to ""event1 happens"".

Thus, C3 simplifies to: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen in the same state. However, event1 and event2 cannot occur in the same state because events are mutually exclusive. Therefore, whenever event2 happens, event1 does not happen, so C2 is false. This means that the implication ""if event2 happens then C2 holds"" is always false.

Hence, C3 is false.

- C1 is a tautology: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"" is always true, regardless of whether event3 occurs.
- C2 states that C1 eventually holds. Since C1 is always true, C2 is always true in every state.
- C3 states that C2 holds in the next state. Given that C2 is always true, it holds in the next state from any state, including the initial state.

From the context, initially event1 happened, and after event1, no other events can happen. Thus, the system remains in a state where event1 is true for all future states. Therefore, in the next state, C2 holds because C1 is always true.

- The initial state is event3.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events happen, so the system remains at event1.

The sequence of events is: event3 → event2 → event1 → event1 → ...

Now, evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is true only in states where event1 has not occurred.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is ""event1 does not happen"", C2 is logically equivalent to ""event1 does not happen"" (because if event1 happens, then C1 would require event1 not to happen, which is false, so the implication is only true when event1 does not happen). Thus, C2 is true when event1 has not happened.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This means that at some point in the sequence, C2 is true.

In the initial state (event3), event1 has not happened, so C2 is true. Similarly, in the state where event2 occurs, event1 has not happened yet, so C2 is true. Therefore, C2 holds at the initial state and at the state after event3. Since C2 holds at these states, C3 is true.

Thus, C3 is True.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Consider a sequence where after event2, we go to event1. Since event1 is not event2 or event3, C1 is false in the event1 state. Therefore, if event2 happens and then event1 occurs, C2 does not hold from the event2 state because event1 violates C1.

- C2 is defined as ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"".

Whenever event3 happens, C1 is immediately true because event3 is one of the disjuncts in C1. Therefore, the implication in C2 is always satisfied whenever event3 occurs. Since this holds in all possible sequences derived from the context, C2 always holds, making C3 True.

The context does not affect this reasoning because event3 always implies C1 is true, regardless of the sequence of events.

- In S0: event1 is false, so the implication event1 → ¬event3 is vacuously true.
- In S1: event1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
- In S2 and beyond: event1 is true and event3 is false, so event1 → ¬event3 is true.

- After event3, event2 must happen, so when event2 is true, C2 is true, but event3 is false.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 happens. If event1 happens, C2 is true (since event1 is true), but event3 is false.
- Thus, in all states where C2 is true (i.e., when event2 or event1 is true), event3 is false. Therefore, the implication ""if C2 holds, then event3 happens"" is always false.

Hence, C3 is false.

- Event2 never occurs in any state because there is no transition that leads to event2.

Now, evaluating the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" – Since event2 never happens, C1 is always false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" – Since C1 is always false, C2 is always true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, let's analyze step by step:

- The system starts with event2 having happened initially.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event2 indefinitely.
- Therefore, event1 and event3 never occur after the initial state.

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 happens in the next state. This means that at any state S, C1 is true only if event3 occurs at state S+1.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state. This means that at any state S, C2 is true only if C1 is true at state S+1, which implies that event3 occurs at state S+2.
- C3: If C2 holds, then event2 happens. This is an implication that should hold at every state. If C2 is true at state S, then event2 must be true at state S.

In this system, event3 never occurs at any state because the system remains in event2 forever. Therefore, for any state S, event3 does not occur at S+2, so C2(S) is always false. Since C2 is always false, the implication ""if C2 holds, then event2 happens"" is vacuously true for all states.

Thus, C3 is true.

In any state, only one event can occur. Therefore, if Event2 happens in a state, Event1 and Event3 cannot happen in that same state. This means that C1 cannot be true in any state where Event2 happens, as C1 requires Event1 or Event3 to be true. Thus, C2 can never hold because it requires both Event2 and C1 to be true simultaneously.

Additionally, from the initial state (Event3) and the transitions (after Event3, Event1 must happen; after Event1, Event3 must happen), the sequence alternates between Event3 and Event1 indefinitely. Event2 never occurs in this sequence, as there is no transition from Event1 or Event3 to Event2. Therefore, Event2 never happens, further ensuring that C2 never holds.

- After event2, no other events can happen, so from t=1 onwards, event2 remains true forever.
- Event3 never occurs in this sequence because there is no transition to event3 from any event.

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" means that from the current state, event1 will be true at some future state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means that at every state, C1 is true (i.e., from every state, event1 eventually happens).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" means that C2 is false.

Evaluate C1 at each state:
- At t=0: event1 is true, so C1 is true (event1 is happening now, so it eventually happens).
- At t=1: event2 is true, and from here, only event2 occurs forever. Event1 never happens again in the future. Thus, from t=1, event1 does not eventually happen, so C1 is false.

Since C1 is false at t=1, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

The possible sequences are:

C1 (""Event1 always happens"") requires that event1 is true in every state of the sequence. However, in both sequences, there are states where event1 is not true:
- In Sequence 1, when event2 is true, event1 is false.
- In Sequence 2, after the initial event1, event3 is true, so event1 is false.

Therefore, C1 is false in all possible sequences. Since C1 is always false, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is always true. Thus, C2 always holds, meaning C3 is true.

C2 is defined as ""C1 holds in the next state,"" and C1 is defined as ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Therefore, C2 in any state S means that event2 happens in state S+2. C3 requires that for every state, event2 happens two states later.

The initial state is event1 at t=0. From event1, either event2 or event3 must happen at t=1:
- If event2 happens at t=1, then after event2, no other events occur, so event2 remains true for all t ≥ 1.
- If event3 happens at t=1, then after event3, event2 must happen at t=2, and event2 remains true for all t ≥ 2.

In both cases, event2 is true for all t ≥ 2. Therefore, for any state S, event2 is true at S+2, meaning C2 is always true. Thus, C3 is true.

- C1 states ""event2 happens and event2 happens,"" which simplifies to ""event2 happens.""
- C2 states that C1 always holds, meaning event2 must happen in every state.
- C3 states that if event1 happens, then C2 must hold.

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

This means that in any sequence, event2 does not always happen because after event2, event1 or event3 must occur. Therefore, in states where event1 or event3 happens, event2 is not happening, so C2 is false.

Since event1 can happen (e.g., from initial event2, choosing event1), and when event1 happens, C2 is false, the implication ""if event1 happens, then C2 holds"" is false. Thus, C3 is false.

In the system, when event2 happens, only event2 is true in that state, meaning event1 and event3 are both false. Since event3 is false, C1 holds (because event3 does not happen), and thus C2 holds regardless of event1.

- C2 is defined as ""C1 does not hold,"" meaning ""event1 does not happen.""

The initial state is event2, so event1 does not happen initially. Therefore, C2 holds immediately in the initial state. Since C2 holds from the start, C3 is true.

Even in sequences where event1 occurs later, such as event2 → event1 → event2, there are always states where event2 or event3 occurs, and in those states, event1 does not happen. Thus, C2 eventually holds in all possible sequences.

Initially, event3 happened, so C1 is false initially, meaning C2 is false initially. However, C3 only requires that whenever event1 occurs, C2 holds at that moment (i.e., from that state onwards, C1 always holds).

From the context:
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus, if event1 occurs, event3 never happens after that, so C1 holds for all future states. Therefore, at the state where event1 occurs, C2 holds.

The possible sequences from the initial state are:
- Sequence 1: event3 → event2 → event1 → event1 → ... (event1 occurs, and after that, event3 never happens, so C2 holds when event1 occurs).
- Sequence 2: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ... (event1 never occurs, so the condition ""if event1 happens"" is false, making C3 vacuously true).

In all sequences, whenever event1 happens, C2 holds. Thus, C3 is true.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

This leads to a cycle where event2 occurs frequently, but there are always states where event1 or event3 occurs, meaning event2 does not happen at those states. Specifically:
- From any state, within at most two steps, a state where event2 does not happen (i.e., event1 or event3) is reached.
- Therefore, from every state, C1 eventually holds (i.e., there is a future state where event2 does not happen).
- Thus, C2 is true from every state.
- Since C2 is always true, C3 (C2 always holds) is true.

Therefore, C3 is True.

Therefore, C2 is true if either event1 or event2 occurs in the current state.

Initially, event3 happened, so in the initial state, event1 and event2 are not true, meaning C2 is false. However, from the context, after event3, event1 must happen. Therefore, in the next state after the initial state, event1 occurs, making C2 true.

Even if after event1, the sequence moves to event2 or event3, C2 will be true when event1 or event2 occurs. Specifically:
- If after event1, event2 occurs, then in that state, event2 is true, so C2 is true.
- If after event1, event3 occurs, then after event3, event1 must occur again, so event1 will occur in a subsequent state, making C2 true.

Thus, in all possible sequences, C2 becomes true in the state immediately after the initial state or later. Therefore, C2 eventually holds, meaning C3 is true.

Initially, event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen, so the next state after event1 is event2. Therefore, at the initial state, C1 is false because the next state does not have event1. Thus, C2 does not hold at the initial state, meaning C2 is not always true from the start.

Furthermore, from the transitions, the sequence alternates between event1 and event2: after event1, event2 occurs; after event2, event1 occurs. At any state where event1 is true, the next state is event2, so C1 is false. At any state where event2 is true, the next state is event1, so C1 is true at that state, but at the next state (event1), C1 becomes false.

The initial state has event1 true. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. If event2 happens immediately, then event3 never occurs, so C3 cannot be true. However, if event3 happens after event1, then at the state where event3 is true (let's call this state S), we check C2. C2 requires that C1 does not hold, meaning event1 does not happen in the next state. After event3, event2 must happen, so in the next state, event2 is true and event1 is false. Thus, at state S, C1 is false, so C2 is true. Therefore, at state S, both C2 is true and event3 is true, meaning C3 is true.

Since there exists a sequence where C3 holds, C3 is true.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Considering the sequences:
- From the initial state (event1), the next state must be event2.
- From event2, the next state must be either event1 or event3.
- If the next state is event1, then from event1, event2 must happen again, leading to a cycle like event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
- If the next state is event3, then from event3, the next state must be event1 or event2. If event1, then event2 must follow; if event2, then from event2, event1 or event3 must follow.

In all possible sequences, event2 occurs frequently but not in every state. For example, in the cycle event1 → event2 → event1 → event2, event2 occurs in every other state, but not in states where event1 or event3 occurs. Therefore, event2 does not always happen in every state.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events happen, so the system remains in event3.

The sequence of events is: event2 (state0) → event1 (state1) → event3 (state2) → event3 (state3) → ...

Now, evaluate C1: ""Event3 always happens."" This means event3 must be true in every state. However, in state0 (event2) and state1 (event1), event3 is false. Therefore, C1 is false.

Since C1 is false, C2 simplifies to ""Event2 happens"" in the current state. C2 is true only if event2 is true in the current state.

- In state0, event2 is true, so C2 is true.
- In state1, event2 is false, so C2 is false.
- In state2 and beyond, event2 is false, so C2 is false.

Thus, C2 holds only in state0 but not in subsequent states. Therefore, C2 does not always hold, meaning C3 is false.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in a state where event2 is true and no subsequent events occur.
- Therefore, event1 never happens, and event3 never happens.
- Since no other events occur, there is no ""next state"" where event3 happens, so C1 is always false.
- Thus, C2 (Event1 or C1) is always false because Event1 never happens and C1 is false.

The hypothesis involves C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" From the initial state (S0), the next state is S1 (event1). C2 is defined as ""C1 always holds,"" meaning C1 must be true at every state from the point of evaluation.

At S1, C2 requires that C1 holds always from S1 onward. C1 is ""event2 happens in the next state."" However, at S1, there is no next state because after event1, no other events happen. Therefore, C1 is false at S1. Since C1 is false at S1, C2 is false at S1.

- The initial state is event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 happens and event2 happens. This requires both events to be true simultaneously in some state. However, in any state, only one event can be true. Therefore, C1 can never hold in any state.
- C2: C1 eventually holds. Since C1 never holds, C2 is always false.
- C3: Event2 happens or C2 holds. Since C2 is always false, C3 simplifies to Event2 happens.

Now, check if Event2 always happens:
- From the initial state (event3), if event1 is chosen after event3, then the sequence becomes event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... and so on. In this sequence, event2 never happens.
- Therefore, there exists a sequence where event2 does not happen, so C3 is false in that sequence.

From the initial state (event3), the sequence of events is determined: after event3, event1 must happen; after event1, event3 must happen. This creates an infinite cycle between event3 and event1. Event2 never occurs in this cycle because the transitions always lead to event1 or event3.

Now, consider each state in the cycle:
- At a state where event3 is true (e.g., the initial state), the next state is event1. Thus, event3 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false, and C2 is true.
- At a state where event1 is true, the next state is event3. Thus, event3 happens in the next state, so C1 is true, and C2 is false.

Since there exists a state (where event1 is true) where C2 is false, C2 does not always hold. Therefore, C3 is false.

The initial state is event1. From event1, the next event can be either event2 or event3. If event2 is chosen, then event2 happens immediately, satisfying C1 and C2. However, if event3 is chosen from event1, then after event3, event1 must happen (as per the context). This can lead to a sequence where event1 always transitions to event3, creating an infinite loop: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... . In this loop, event2 never happens.

Since there exists at least one sequence where event2 never happens, C1 and C2 do not hold in that sequence. Therefore, C3 does not hold.

- C1 is ""Event2 always happens."" This means event2 must be true in every state. However, in the initial state (event1), event2 is not true. Therefore, C1 is false initially. But from state 1 onward, event2 is always true, so C1 eventually holds from state 1.

- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- Thus, the sequence is: event2 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... and so on.

Now, consider the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""event1 happens"".
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" means that in any state where event1 is true, event3 must also be true in the same state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" means that C2 must be true in every state.

In the sequence, there are states where event1 is true (e.g., after event3). In these states, event3 is not true simultaneously because only one event happens per state. Therefore, in states where event1 is true, C2 is false.

Since C2 is false in some states, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

- C1 is defined as ""Event3 happens and event3 happens,"" which simplifies to ""event3 happens.""
- C2 is defined as ""Event2 happens and C1 holds,"" meaning ""event2 happens and event3 happens."" This requires both event2 and event3 to be true simultaneously in the same state.
- However, in the given context, only one event can occur in any single state. The transitions describe sequential events: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event3 must happen; after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. There is no scenario where event2 and event3 occur at the same time.
- Therefore, C2 is always false in every state.
- C3 is defined as ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is always false, it cannot hold in the next state from any state, including the initial state.
- Thus, C3 is false.

- The initial state has event3 true.

Considering the possible sequences:
- One sequence is event3 → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... where event1 occurs in some states but not in all states (e.g., after event1, event2 must happen, so event1 is not true in the state where event2 is true).

The initial state has event3 happening, so C2 holds initially. However, after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. If event1 happens, then event2 must follow, and after event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in a state where event2 is true. Similarly, if event2 happens directly after event3, the system remains in event2. In both cases, after the initial event3, event3 does not happen in subsequent states.

Therefore, event2 does not necessarily eventually happen, meaning C1 and C2 may not hold. Thus, C3 is false.

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", which simplifies to ""event2 happens"".

Thus, C2 means ""event2 happens"", and C3 means that event2 always happens in every state.

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so in the next state, event1 occurs, meaning event2 does not happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen, so in the subsequent state, event3 occurs, meaning event2 does not happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. If event2 happens, then after event2, event1 must happen again, so event2 does not persist.

Therefore, event2 only occurs in some states (e.g., initially and after event3 if event2 is chosen), but not in all states. Specifically, after event2, event1 always occurs, so event2 cannot be true in consecutive states. Hence, event2 does not always happen.

Consequently, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 does not hold from the initial state or any other state.

The initial state is event1. From event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3, as per the context.

- If the next state is event2, then after event2, no other events happen. Thus, event3 never occurs, so C1 is false. Also, event1 does not happen in this state. Therefore, C2 is false in this next state.
- If the next state is event3, then event3 occurs, so C1 is true. Thus, C2 is true in this next state.

Since there is a path (to event2) where C2 does not hold in the next state, C3 is not true for all possible paths. Therefore, C3 is false.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 occurred.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event2 indefinitely.
- After event1, event2 must happen, but event1 never occurs in the sequence starting from event3.

The event sequence is:
- State 0: event3
- State 1: event2
- State 2: event2
- State 3: event2, and so on.

Now, check C1 at each state:
- At state 0: The next state is state 1 (event2), so event3 does not happen in the next state. Thus, C1 is false.
- At state 1: The next state is state 2 (event2), so event3 does not happen in the next state. Thus, C1 is false.
- Similarly, at all subsequent states, the next state is always event2, so C1 is always false.

Since C1 is always false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is never true. Therefore, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" – This requires both events to be true simultaneously in some state, but since events are mutually exclusive per state, C1 can never be true in any state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" – Since C1 is never true, C2 is always false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" – Event1 never happens, and C2 is always false, so C3 is false.

Thus, C3 is False.

- The context states that initially, event3 happened. After event3, event1 must happen, then event2, then event1, and so on. This implies a sequence where events occur one at a time: event3 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... 
- In any single state, only one event can be true at a time, as inferred from the previous examples and the nature of event sequences.
- C1 requires both event1 and event3 to happen simultaneously in the same state. However, event3 only occurs in the initial state, and event1 occurs in subsequent states, but never simultaneously with event3. Therefore, C1 never holds.
- C2 requires event2 to happen and C1 to hold. Since C1 never holds, C2 never holds.
- C3 requires that C2 eventually holds. Since C2 never holds, C3 is false.

Thus, C3 is False.

- C2 is defined as C1 holds or event2 happens.
- C1 is defined as event3 happens in the next state.

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

The system cycles between event2 and event3, and event1 never occurs because there is no transition that leads to event1. Therefore, event1 is always false.

Now, evaluate C2:
- In states where event2 is true, C2 is true because event2 happens.
- In states where event3 is true, C2 is false because event2 does not happen and C1 is false (since from event3, the next state is event2, not event3).

Thus, C2 holds only in states where event2 is true. However, in these states, event1 is false. Therefore, when C2 holds, event1 does not happen, violating C3.

Hence, C3 is false.

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" means that at some point in the future, event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" means that event3 never happens in the future from the current state.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event3 happens"" means that at some state, both C2 is true (event3 never happens in the future) and event3 occurs at that state.

From the context, the event sequence starts with event1, and event3 must happen after event1. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen, and from event2, event3 must happen. This means that event3 occurs repeatedly in all possible sequences. Therefore, at any state, event3 will happen in the future, so C1 is always true, and thus C2 is always false.

If C2 is always false, it can never hold. Additionally, if event3 happens at a state, then from that state, event3 has already occurred, so C1 is true, making C2 false. Therefore, it is impossible for C2 to hold and event3 to happen simultaneously.

Hence, C3 is false.

- Initially, event3 happened.
- From event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2, but not event3. Therefore, in the initial state, the next state does not have event3, so C2 is false at the initial state.
- Since C2 is false at the initial state, C3 (which requires C2 to hold in every state) is false.

Additionally:
- If event1 occurs, no other events happen, so the state remains event1. Thus, from event1, the next state is event1, not event3, so C2 is false.
- From event2, the next event may be event1 or event3. If it is event1, C2 is false; even if it is event3, C2 may be true only from that state, but since C2 is already false from event3 and event1, C3 cannot hold always.

- The initial state is event1.
- The transitions are: after event3, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
- From the initial event1, the sequence alternates between event1 and event2 indefinitely, as there is no transition to event3 from event1 or event2. Thus, event3 never occurs.

Now, evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since the sequence always includes event2 (either immediately or in the next state), C1 is always true at every state.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 simplifies to ""event2 happens"" at the current state. However, in states where event1 is true, event2 is not happening, so C2 is false in those states.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false in states where event1 is true, C2 does not always hold. Therefore, C3 is false.

Thus, C3 is False.

- Initially, event2 happened (state S2).
- From state S2, the next state must be event1 (state S1), and from state S1, no other events happen, so the system remains in state S1 forever.
- In state S2, C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false because the next state is S1, where event2 is false. Therefore, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true in state S2.
- However, in state S2, event1 does not happen (event2 happens). Thus, when C2 holds in state S2, event1 does not happen, violating C3.
- In state S1, C2 holds (since C1 is false), and event1 happens, so C3 holds in state S1. But since C3 fails in state S2, C3 is not true for all states.

Therefore, C3 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen, so the system remains in event2 indefinitely.
- After event1, event3 must happen, but event1 never occurs in the sequence because the system starts at event3 and moves to event2, with no path to event1.

Now, evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 never happens, C1 is vacuously true at all times.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" C2 is true when event2 occurs and C1 holds. Since event2 occurs at t=1 and beyond, and C1 is always true, C2 is true from t=1 onwards.

From the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

The possible sequences from the initial state (event3) are:
- If from event3 we go to event1, then from event1 we go to event2. At state event1, C1 is true because the next state is event2.
- If from event3 we go to event2, then at state event3, C1 is true because the next state is event2.

Thus, in all possible sequences, C1 eventually holds (either at event3 or at event1). Therefore, C2 is true.

Since C2 is true, C3 (which states that C2 does not hold) is false.

- The context states that initially, event3 happened. After event3, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. This results in a sequence where event3 occurs only initially, followed by a cycle between event1 and event2.
- C1 is defined as ""Event3 does not happen."" Since event3 occurs only in the initial state, C1 is true in all subsequent states but false in the initial state.
- C2 is defined as ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" This requires both C1 to be true and event3 to be true simultaneously. However, if C1 is true, event3 does not happen, and if event3 happens, C1 is false. Thus, C2 is always false in every state.
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is never true, C3 cannot be true.

- C1 is defined as ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2 is defined as ""C1 holds or event2 happens.""
- C3 is defined as ""C2 does not hold.""

C2 can be rewritten logically: if we let P be ""event2 happens,"" then C1 is ¬P, and C2 is ¬P ∨ P. This is always true, regardless of the state or event sequence.

In all possible event sequences:
- Initially, event1 happened, so event2 has not happened yet. Thus, C1 is true, and C2 is true.
- If event2 occurs, then event2 happens, so C2 is true.
- If event3 occurs, leading to event1, and so on, event2 may not happen, but C1 is true, so C2 is true.

Since C2 is always true, it never does not hold. Therefore, C3, which asserts that C2 does not hold, is false.

However, from the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen, meaning that after event2, event2 cannot immediately occur again; instead, event1 or event3 must occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so event1 is always followed by event2.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

In any possible sequence, event2 cannot happen in every state because:
- After event2, event1 or event3 must occur, so in the state following event2, event2 is not true.
- Similarly, after event1, event2 must occur, but event1 itself is a state where event2 is not true.
- After event3, event1 or event2 must occur, but event3 is a state where event2 is not true.

- The initial state has event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events happen, so the system remains in event1.

The sequence of events is fixed: event2 → event3 → event1 → event1 → ...

Now, consider the conditions:
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state. This means that from the current state, the next event should be event2.
- C2: C1 always holds. This means that in every state, C1 must be true.
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.

Evaluate C1 in each state:
- From the initial state (event2), the next state is event3, so event2 does not happen next. Thus, C1 is false.
- From the state after event3, the next state is event1, so event2 does not happen next. Thus, C1 is false.
- From the state after event1, the next state is event1, so event2 does not happen next. Thus, C1 is false.

Since C1 is false in every state, C2 (which requires C1 to always hold) is false.

Now, C3 states that if event2 happens, then C2 holds. Event2 happens in the initial state, but C2 is false. Therefore, the implication is false.

- C1 is defined as ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2 is defined as ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event2 forever.

Therefore, in every state where event2 occurs, the next state will always have event2. This means that whenever event2 happens, C1 holds (since event2 happens in the next state). Thus, C2 is true in every state where event2 happens. In states where event2 does not happen, the implication ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is vacuously true. Therefore, C2 holds globally.

Since C2 holds, C3 (which claims that C2 does not hold) is false.

- C1 states that ""Event1 always happens,"" meaning event1 is true in every state. However, from the context, after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen, so event1 cannot always be true. In the cycle between event1 and event2, event1 is not true when event2 occurs, and if event3 occurs, event1 never happens again. Therefore, C1 is never true.

- C2 states that ""C1 eventually holds,"" meaning there exists a future state where C1 becomes true and remains true. Since C1 is never true, C2 is always false.

- C3 states that ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is always false, it cannot hold in the next state. Therefore, C3 is false.

From the initial state (event2), the next state must be event3 because after event2, event3 must happen. Thus, at state S1, event3 occurs.

After event3, no other events can happen, so all subsequent states (S2, S3, etc.) have event3.

Now, C3 at the initial state S0 requires that at S1, C2 holds. However, C2 at S1 requires that at S2, C1 holds. C1 at S2 requires that at S3, event2 happens. But since S3 has event3 (and event2 never occurs after event3), C1 at S2 is false. Therefore, C2 at S1 is false, meaning C3 at S0 is false.

- Initially, event3 happened at time t=0.
- After event3, event2 must happen, so at time t=1, event2 occurs.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so from t=1 onwards, event2 remains true.

Now, consider the conditions:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" means event3 must be true in every state. However, after t=0, event3 is false from t=1 onwards, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" requires both event3 to be true and C1 to be true. Since C1 is false, C2 is always false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" checks if C2 is true in the state following the current one. At t=0, the next state is t=1, where C2 is false. Since C2 is always false, C3 is false.

- Initially, event1 happened, so in the initial state, event1 is true, meaning C1 (event1 does not happen) is false.
- From event1, the system must transition to either event2 or event3.

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" Since event3 never happens, C1 is false from the initial state and all subsequent states.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means that at every point in time, C1 must be true. However, since C1 is false at the initial state and remains false, C2 is false.

If event1 occurs, there is no next event, so C1 (event2 in the next state) is false at the state where event1 occurs.

C2 itself states that ""C1 holds in the next state,"" so for C2 to be true in the next state, C1 must be true in the state after that.

C1 requires both event2 and event3 to happen simultaneously in the same state. However, from the initial state (event2), the next state must have event1 (as after event2, event1 must happen). After event1, no other events can happen, so the system remains in event1 indefinitely. Event3 never occurs in this sequence. Therefore, in no state do both event2 and event3 occur simultaneously, so C1 is never true.

- The initial state is event2 (at time t=0).
- After event2, event3 must happen, so at time t=1, event3 occurs.
- After event3, event1 must happen, so at time t=2, event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events happen, so for all t ≥ 2, event1 remains true.

Now, consider C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" C1 holds at time t if at time t+1, event3 occurs.
- At t=0, the next state (t=1) has event3, so C1 holds at t=0.
- At t=1, the next state (t=2) has event1, so C1 does not hold.
- At t=2 and beyond, the next state always has event1, so C1 never holds.

C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds at t=0, C2 is true.

C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

From the initial state (event1 happened), we derive the sequence of events:
- After event1, event3 must happen, so we move to a state where event3 is true.
- After event3, event2 must happen, so we move to a state where event2 is true.
- After event2, event3 must happen, so we move back to a state where event3 is true, and so on.

Evaluating C2 in each state:
- In the initial state (event1 true, event2 false, event3 false): C1 is true (since event2 is false), but event3 is false, so C2 is false.
- In the state where event3 is true and event2 is false: C1 is true (event2 false), and event3 is true, so C2 is true.
- In the state where event2 is true and event3 is false: C1 is false (since event2 true but event3 false), and event3 is false, so C2 is false.

Since C2 is false in the initial state and in the state where event2 is true, C2 does not always hold. Therefore, C3 is false.

In the system, only one event can be true in any state. Therefore, when event2 happens, event3 cannot happen in the same state, so C1 is always true when event2 is true.

- The initial state is event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen, creating an infinite cycle between event1 and event2.
- Event3 is not reachable from event1 or event2, as there are no transitions to event3 from these events.

In this cycle, event1 occurs in every other state but not in every state. Therefore, for any state where event1 is true, there is a future state where event1 is false (because event2 occurs). This means that C1 (""Event1 always happens"") never holds in any state, as event1 does not hold in all future states from any point.

- C1 is defined as ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology and always true.

- The context defines a sequence of events starting with event2. After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event3 must happen; after event3, event2 must happen. This creates a cycle: event2 → event1 → event3 → event2 → ...
- C1 states ""Event1 does not happen,"" meaning in the current state, event1 is false.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold,"" meaning C1 is false, so event1 must happen in the current state. Thus, C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C3 states ""C2 always holds,"" meaning in every state, C2 is true, so event1 must happen in every state.

However, from the event sequence:
- Initially, event2 happens, so event1 does not happen. Thus, C2 is false at the initial state.
- In subsequent states, event1 happens only at certain points (e.g., after event2), but not in all states (e.g., when event2 or event3 happens). Therefore, C2 is not true in every state.

- C2 is defined as ""C1 does not hold,"" meaning ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C3 states that ""C2 always holds,"" meaning ""Event2 never happens.""

However, from the context:

- After event1, event2 must happen.

- The initial state has event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so the next state has event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so the state after event1 has event2.
- This creates a cycle: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...
- Event3 is not triggered in this cycle, but if it were, after event3, event2 must happen, meaning event3 would be followed by event2, but during event3, event2 is not happening.

Now, examining the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means event2 happens in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" means that C2 is true in every state, which again requires event2 in every state.

However, from the event sequence, event1 occurs after event2, so there are states where event1 happens and event2 does not. Therefore, event2 does not happen in every state, so C1 is false in those states, meaning C2 is false. Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

The event sequence is fixed due to the context:
- Initially, event2 occurred at state s0.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so at state s1, event1 occurs.
- After event1, event3 must happen, so at state s2, event3 occurs.
- After event3, no other events can happen, so from state s2 onwards, event3 remains true.

Now, evaluate C1, C2, and C3 at each state:
- At s0 (event2): C1 is true because the next state (s1) has event1. Since C1 is true at s0, C2 is true at s0.
- At s1 (event1): C1 is false because the next state (s2) has event3, not event1. C2 requires that C1 eventually holds, but from s1 onwards, all future states have event3, so the next state never has event1. Thus, C1 never holds in the future, so C2 is false at s1.
- At s2 and beyond (event3): C1 is false because the next state always has event3, not event1. C2 is false because C1 never holds in the future.

Since C2 is false at s1 and all subsequent states, C2 does not always hold. Therefore, C3 is false.

This leads to the sequence: event1 → event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... and so on.

C1 claims that event1 always happens, meaning in every state, event1 is true. However, after the initial state, event1 never occurs again (only event2 and event3 repeat). Thus, C1 is false in all states after the initial state, meaning C1 does not hold.

Since C1 is false, C2 simplifies to ""Event3 happens"" in each state. But event3 only happens in every other state (specifically, in states where event3 occurs, such as state 2, state 4, etc.). In states where event2 occurs (state 1, state 3, etc.) or event1 occurs (state 0), event3 does not happen. Therefore, C2 is false in those states.

Since C2 does not hold in all states, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

The initial state has event1 at time 0. From event1, the next event can be either event2 or event3.

- C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology and always true.
- C2 states: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is always true regardless of the state.
- C3 states: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Since C2 is always true, C3 simplifies to ""event1 happens.""

Now, from the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event2 indefinitely.
- There is no transition that leads to event1 from any state in the sequence. Specifically, from initial event3, the system moves to event2 and stays there, so event1 never occurs.

Therefore, since event1 never happens, C3 is false.

- After event3, no other events can happen, so from t=2 onwards, event3 remains true.

- C3: C2 always holds, meaning C2 is true in every state.

At t=0, the next state (t=1) has event2, not event1, so C1 is false at t=0. Therefore, C2 is false at t=0. Since C2 is false at t=0, C2 does not always hold. Thus, C3 is false.

Similarly, at other states (t=1, t=2, etc.), event1 never happens in the next state, so C1 is always false, meaning C2 is always false. Therefore, C3 is false.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event3 indefinitely.
- After event1, event2 must happen, but event1 never occurs in the sequence because the initial state is event2, and from there, the system moves to event3 and stays there.

The only possible event sequence is: event2 → event3 → event3 → ... 

Now, evaluating C2: C2 requires that in the next state, C1 holds (i.e., event1 or event2 happens). However, after event2, the next state is event3, and after event3, all subsequent states are event3. Since event3 is neither event1 nor event2, C1 is never true in any next state. Therefore, C2 never holds.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in event2 indefinitely.
- Event3 never occurs in any state because the sequence always transitions from event1 to event2 and then stays at event2.

Since only one event can be true in any state, it is impossible for both event1 and event3 to be true simultaneously. Additionally, event3 never occurs at all in the sequence. Therefore, C1 and C2 are always false.

Thus, C3, which requires both C1 and C2 to hold, is false.

- The initial state is event2.

- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

- Event1 never occurs in any state because there is no transition to event1.

- C1 requires both event3 and event1 to happen simultaneously in the same state. However, in the given context, only one event can occur per state. Therefore, C1 can never be true.
- C2 requires event3 to happen and C1 to hold, which again requires both event3 and event1 in the same state. Since C1 is never true, C2 is also never true.
- C3 states that C2 holds in the next state. Since C2 is never true in any state, it cannot hold in the next state from any state, including the initial state.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen, so the sequence remains at event3 forever.
- The sequence is: event2 (initial) → event3 → event3 → ... 

Now, evaluate C1 (◇ event2) at each state:
- At the initial state (event2), event2 has just happened, so ◇ event2 is true.
- At all subsequent states (event3), event2 never happens again, so ◇ event2 is false.

C2 is □ ◇ event2, meaning that from every state, event2 eventually happens. However:
- From the initial state, at the next state (event3), ◇ event2 is false, so □ ◇ event2 is false.
- From any state after event3, ◇ event2 is false, so □ ◇ event2 is false.

Thus, C2 is always false. Therefore, C3 (◇ C2) is false because C2 never holds.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

The possible sequences are:
1. event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... (cycling between event2 and event1).
2. event2 → event1 → event3 → event3 → ... (stuck at event3).

In both sequences, event2 does not always happen:
- In sequence 1, event1 occurs alternately with event2, so event2 is not true in every state.
- In sequence 2, after event3, event2 is false.

Thus, C1 is false. Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. Then C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false, because C2 holds.

- C2 states that C1 eventually holds. Since C1 is true from the start, C2 is also true immediately.
- C3 states that if C2 holds, then event2 happens. However, event2 never occurs in the system because after event3, no events change, and event1 never occurs to trigger event2. Thus, event2 does not happen.

Since C2 holds but event2 does not happen, the implication in C3 is false. Therefore, C3 is false.

From the context, initially event2 happened, and after event2, event1 must happen. This means that whenever event2 occurs, the next event is always event1.

In this sequential event model, only one event can be true in any given state. Therefore, C1 requires both event2 and event3 to be true simultaneously in a state, which is impossible. Thus, C1 is always false.

Since C1 is always false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also always false. Consequently, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false because C2 never holds in any state.

Additionally, from the context, the initial event is event1, and the rules dictate that after event1, event2 must happen, and after event2, event1 must happen.

- The context states that initially, event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. This creates a cycle where event1 and event2 alternate continuously. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen, but since the sequence starts with event1 and cycles between event1 and event2, event3 never occurs in this sequence.

- Now, examining the hypothesis:
  - C1: Event2 does not happen.
  - C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. Since C1 is ""event2 does not happen"", C2 is equivalent to ""event2 does not happen"" because if event2 happens, it would imply that event2 does not happen, which is a contradiction. Thus, C2 holds only if event2 does not happen.
  - C3: C2 does not hold. This means that C2 is false, which occurs only if event2 happens.

- From the context, event2 must happen because after event1, event2 must occur. Since the initial state is event1, event2 will occur in the next state, and the cycle ensures event2 continues to occur. Therefore, event2 happens, so C2 does not hold, meaning C3 is true.

- Initially, event2 happened, so C2 (which is equivalent to event2 or event3) is true.
- After event2, event3 must happen, so in all subsequent states, event3 is true, making C2 true.
- Since event1 never occurs in the sequence, there is no state where both event2 and event3 are false.

Therefore, C2 holds in every state, meaning that C3 (C2 does not hold) is false.

- C3 is defined as ""Event1 happens and C2 holds,"" which means ""Event1 happens and Event1 does not happen."" This is a logical contradiction and can never be true.

From the context, the initial state is event2, and the events cycle between event2 and event3. Event1 never occurs in this cycle, so Event1 does not happen. Therefore, C3 cannot hold because it requires Event1 to happen, which is false.

Even if Event1 were to occur, C2 would be false (since Event1 happens), so C3 would still be false. Thus, C3 is always false.

- From the context, initially event2 happened, and after event2, event3 must happen. After event3, no other events can happen, meaning the sequence proceeds to event3 and remains there.
- In any state, only one event can be true at a time, so C1 (which requires both event2 and event3 to be true simultaneously) is always false.
- Since C1 is always false, C2 (which requires C1 to be true in the next state) is always false.
- C3 requires event2 to happen and C2 to hold. Although event2 happens in the initial state, C2 is false in that state because C1 is false in the next state (where event3 happens alone).
- Therefore, C3 is never true.

Thus, C3 is False.

From the initial state, event1 occurred. After event1, event3 must happen, and after event3, no other events can happen. Thus, the only possible sequence is: event1 followed by event3, then event3 indefinitely. Event2 never occurs in this sequence.

Now, evaluate C2 in each state:
- In the initial state (event1 true), C2 is true because event1 happens.
- In all subsequent states (event3 true), event1 is false. C1 requires that event2 always happens from that state onward, but since event2 never occurs, C1 is false. Thus, C2 is false in these states.

Since C2 is false in states after the initial state, C2 does not always hold. Therefore, C3 is false.

- After event3, no other events can happen, but event3 never occurs in the sequence since the system alternates between event2 and event1.

In every state where event2 happens, the next state always has event1 due to the transitions. Therefore, C2 always holds because whenever event2 is true, C1 (event1 in the next state) is true.

Since C2 always holds, C3 (which claims that C2 does not hold) is false.

Thus, C3 is False.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

This means that from any point in the sequence, event1 will eventually occur. For example:
- At the initial state (event1), event1 has already occurred, so C1 is true.
- After event1, event3 occurs, and from event3, event1 or event2 occurs. If event1 occurs, C1 is true; if event2 occurs, event1 must follow, so C1 is true.
- Thus, at every point, C1 is true, meaning C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Since C2 is true, C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

Therefore, C3 is False.

- C1 is defined as ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2 is defined as ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is ""event3 does not happen,"" C2 simplifies to ""event3 does not happen"" because if event3 happens, C1 must hold, but C1 requires event3 not to happen, leading to a contradiction. Thus, C2 is logically equivalent to ¬event3.

The initial state is event2. After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen in the next state.

- If the next state is event1, then event3 does not happen, so C2 holds.
- If the next state is event3, then event3 happens, so C2 does not hold.

Since there is a possible next state where event3 happens, C2 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore, C3 is not always true and is false.

Answer: False"
