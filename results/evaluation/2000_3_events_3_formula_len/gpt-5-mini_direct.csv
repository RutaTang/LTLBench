Explanation: From initial event1 the next state must be event2 or event3, so C1 is false at the initial state. There is a valid run 1,3,2,3,2,3,... that never produces event1 again (from 2 one can always choose 3), so C1 never holds on that run. Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is not guaranteed, and therefore C3 is false."
