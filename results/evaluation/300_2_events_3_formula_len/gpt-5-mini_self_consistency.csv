Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis is asking
- C3 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" (i.e. C1 → C2).

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 always happens.""
They are the identical proposition.

Step 3 — logical reasoning
- An implication P → P is a tautology: any statement implies itself, so C1 → C2 is always true.
- (Independently, from the context: starting with event1 and the rules that event1 forces event2 and event2 forces event1, event2 does occur repeatedly, so C1/C2 would hold; either way C1 → C2 holds.)

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The hypothesis asks about C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""
2. C1 and C2 are the same statement (""Event2 always happens"").
3. An implication of the form P → P is a tautology — it is always true.
4. Independently, the context (event1 initially, and the rule that event1→event2 and event2→event1) guarantees event2 will occur repeatedly, so C1 and C2 are true anyway.
5. Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 and C2 are the same claim: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C3 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" (i.e. C1 ⇒ C2).

Step 2 — examine the logic:
- An implication of the form p ⇒ p (a statement implying itself) is a tautology — it is always true regardless of whether p is true or false.

Step 3 — relation to the context (optional check):
- The context describes alternating events starting with event1, so whether ""Event2 always happens"" is true in a temporal sense is irrelevant to the logical form of C3.

Conclusion:
- C3 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C3 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened and after event2 no other events can happen, so no future event1 can occur.
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false (event1 cannot happen).
- C2 (""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is an implication whose antecedent never holds, so C2 is vacuously true in the current (and only) reachable state.
- Therefore C2 already holds, so ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is true.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether there is some future state in which C2 (the implication ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Initially event2 happened (call that state S0).
- After event2, no other events can happen. So from S0 onward there are no occurrences of event1 or event2.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (This is false at S0 because the next state has no events.)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is an implication; at any state where event1 does not occur the antecedent is false, so the implication is vacuously true there.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no events can occur, event1 never occurs at any state in the run.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
Since event1 never occurs, C2 is true at every state (vacuously). Therefore C2 already holds (hence it eventually holds). So C3 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C3 says “C2 eventually holds.” We must decide whether, given the context, there is some (possibly current or future) state in which C2 is true.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means from the initial state onward no events occur in any future state.
- “After event1, event2 must happen” only matters if event1 ever occurs; but since after the initial event2 no events occur, event1 cannot occur later.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “If event1 happens (now), then C1 holds” — i.e. event1 -> next(event1).
- In any state where event1 does not occur, C2 is vacuously true (the antecedent is false).
- Because after the initial state no events occur, in every future state event1 does not occur, so C2 is true in every future state. Even if event1 happened simultaneously with event2 in the initial state, C2 might be false in that initial state, but it becomes true in the next state (where no events occur).

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- Since there is a state (indeed the next state, and all subsequent states) where C2 holds, “eventually C2” is satisfied.

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events occur in any state following the initial one.
- Therefore in the next state event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; thus C2 is true.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold; since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning:

- Initially event1 has happened.
- The context says: after event1, no other events can happen. That means there can be no events in the next state after the initial one (the trace stops).
- C1 asserts: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the stop after the initial event1, C1 is false.
- C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3 asserts: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold (it is true), so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the question: C3 is ""C2 does not hold"". So we need truth values of C1 and C2 to decide C3.

1) C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.”  
- Context: initially event1 already happened, and “after event1, no other events can happen” (i.e. no events occur after the initial event1). Therefore event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is False.

2) C2: “C1 does not hold.”  
- Since C1 is False, C2 is True.

3) C3: “C2 does not hold.”  
- C2 is True, so its negation C3 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts that ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and conditions
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After any event1, event2 must eventually occur.
- After any event2, event1 must eventually occur.
These force an alternating chain of occurrences starting from the initial event1, so event2 will occur (and they will continue to alternate).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is a global truth (event2 does eventually happen), so the implication is true. Also, if event2 happens at some time, then trivially event2 has happened (so ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied), so C2 holds whenever evaluated.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true (for the reasons above) at every point, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step by step:

1. What is being asked: C3 asserts that C2 ""always holds"" (i.e., at every time point the implication in C2 is true). We must decide whether that is true given the context.

2. Understand each condition:
- Context: initially event1 occurred. Also whenever event1 occurs, event2 must eventually occur; and whenever event2 occurs, event1 must eventually occur.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", C1 is entailed by the context (so C1 is true).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Read as: whenever event2 happens, it implies that event2 will eventually happen. If event2 happens at some time, then trivially event2 has happened (so ""event2 eventually happens"" is true from that time). If event2 does not happen at a time, the implication is vacuously true. So C2 is true at every time point.

3. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true: C2 is true at every time, so C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 states: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and consequences
- Initially event1 has happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so sometime after any event1, event2 will occur).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so after any event2, event1 will occur).

From these, starting from the initial event1, event2 will occur, then event1 again, and so on indefinitely (an alternating sequence event1, event2, event1, event2,...).

Step 3 — check C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because the initial event1 forces an event2 later.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Whenever event2 happens at some time t, C1 (event2 eventually happens) is satisfied from that time onward: either because event2 has just occurred (so “eventually” is already met) and, by the cycle, event2 will occur again later as well. Hence the implication is true at every time it could be tested.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 (""C2 always holds"")
- C2 is true at all times: before any event2 the antecedent is false (implication true vacuously); at times when event2 occurs the antecedent is true and, as noted, C1 holds then as well. Therefore C2 holds at every moment, so ""C2 always holds"" is true.

True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"".
- C1 and C2 are both the same claim: ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has already occurred).
- After event2 no other events can happen (the system becomes terminal).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 does not need to occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event2 already happened initially, the claim ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied (standard “eventually” semantics allow the current/initial time).
- Thus C1 is true and C2 is true, so their disjunction C3 is true.

(If one used a nonstandard meaning of “eventually” requiring a strictly later occurrence, then C1/C2 would be false because no events occur after event2; under that reading C3 would be false. Under the usual interpretation, however:)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — logically equivalent to ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. That means event2 has already occurred at the initial time.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen"" do not prevent event2 from having occurred initially; they place constraints on what can happen afterward but do not negate the past occurrence.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- Since event2 already happened initially, the statement ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (the eventuality is satisfied by the initial occurrence).
- Therefore C1 is true, C2 is true, and consequently C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 says ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Both C1 and C2 state the same fact: ""Event2 eventually happens."" So C3 is true exactly when ""Event2 eventually happens"" is true.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. That means event2 occurs at the initial moment (it has already happened at or by the current time).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" only restricts future events but does not prevent event2 from having happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 need not occur; moreover event2 already occurred initially.

Step 3 — reason about ""eventually happens"":
- If event2 has happened already at the initial moment, then there exists some time (the initial time) at which event2 occurs, so ""eventually event2 happens"" is satisfied.

Conclusion:
- C1 is true (and therefore C2 is also true), so their disjunction C3 is true.

- After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore, since event1 has occurred, event2 will (eventually) occur.
- The clause ""after event2, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event2 from occurring; it only makes event2 terminal once it occurs.

- After event2 no other events can happen — irrelevant to whether event2 occurs, only constrains what follows it.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds""): false, since C1 never becomes true.
- C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens""): true, because event1 happens (the disjunction is true if either disjunct is true).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 = (C2 holds) OR (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can ever happen after that.
- Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

Step 3 — check C1 and C2 (intermediate conditions):
- C1 = ""event1 happens AND event2 happens."" Since event2 does not happen, C1 is false.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Because C1 is never true, C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 = (C2) OR (event1 happens). C2 is false, but ""event1 happens"" is true (it happened initially).
- A disjunction with one true disjunct is true.

Final answer: True
---
C3 is True.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 (and after event2) no further events can occur. So event1 does occur, and event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- C1 (""event1 happens and event2 happens"") is false because event2 never happens.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false because C1 never becomes true.
- C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is true because event1 does happen (the disjunction is true even though C2 is false)."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 (globally C1) is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is true in every state, it is certainly true in the next state as well.

Step 3 — trace and temporal considerations
The context enforces an infinite alternating sequence (event1, event2, event1, ...), so ""next state"" exists and the global truth of C1 persists into every next state.

Conclusion
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true.
2. C1 is ""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
3. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true (globally).
4. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — because C2 holds in every state, it certainly holds in the next state.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must determine whether that is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (p → p). It is true in any state regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology and thus true in every state, the claim that C1 always holds is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is a global claim that C1 holds in all states; if C2 is true, it is true in every state of the run, including the next state.

Step 3 — effect of the event alternation
- The context (events alternating starting with event1) does not invalidate C1, which is state-local and tautological, so it does not affect the truth of C2 or C3.

- C3 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", where C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens"" and C2 = the same.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has already occurred at the initial time).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing happens after that point).

Step 3 — interpret ""eventually happens"" and evaluate:
- Standard interpretation of ""eventually"" (sometime at or after now) is satisfied by an event that has already occurred. Since event2 already happened initially, both C1 and C2 are true.

Step 4 — conclude for C3:
- C1 is true and C2 is true, so C3 (their disjunction) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 eventually happens.
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds (i.e., ""Event2 eventually happens or Event2 eventually happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 eventually happens"").

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes event2 terminal, but does not contradict that it happened initially.
- The rule about event1 is irrelevant to whether event2 happened, since event2 already happened initially.

Step 3 — reason about the hypothesis:
- Because event2 has occurred (initially), the statement ""event2 eventually happens"" is true.
- Thus C1 is true and C2 is true, so their disjunction C3 is true.

Final answer: True

What the hypothesis asks:
- C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". Both C1 and C2 state ""Event2 eventually happens"", so C3 asks whether Event2 eventually happens.

Examine the context:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means Event2 has already occurred at the initial time.
- The other facts about ""after event1/after event2 no other events can happen"" are irrelevant to whether Event2 ever occurs, since it already has.

Reasoning:
- Because Event2 has occurred initially, the statement ""Event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied (an event that has happened already counts as having eventually happened).
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true, and thus their disjunction C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What’s being asked
C3 is the statement ""C2 always holds"", where
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"",
- C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state"".

We must decide whether C3 is true given the three context facts.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
- After event2, event1 must happen (a rule triggered only if event2 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it occurs, no further events occur in any later state).

Step 3 — Evaluate C1, C2, C3
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", there are no further events in the next state. Thus in the next state event1 does not occur. So C1 is false at the initial state.
- C2 asserts C1 always holds (i.e., C1 holds in every state). Since C1 is already false at the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3 asserts C2 always holds. Since C2 is false at the initial state, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C3 states: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and C1–C2
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- Context: After event1, no other events can happen.
- Context: After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 ever occurs).

C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and event1 has already happened initially, no events (including another event1) can occur in the next state. So C1 is false (event1 does not necessarily happen in the next state).

C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 is already false in the scenario above, C2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
C3 asserts that C2 always holds. Since C2 is false in the given situation, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" C2 is ""C1 always holds."" C1 is ""event1 happens in the next state."" So C3 is equivalent to saying: in every state, it is true that in the next state event1 happens (i.e. G X(event1)).

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially event1 happened (the initial state has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen — once event1 occurs the run stops (there is no later state with any event).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs (event1 happened initially and blocks any further events).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- In the initial state there is no next state (because after event1 no other events can happen), so ""event1 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false in the initial state.
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" is therefore false (it fails at the initial state).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" is also false.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 has already happened.
- After event1, no other events can occur, so event2 never occurs.
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false.
- C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true because event1 has happened.
- Therefore C2 already holds (hence it will hold at some future point), so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C2 becomes true at some time (now or later).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the initial moment.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no other events can occur at any later time (in particular, event2 cannot occur later).
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This constraint is irrelevant once we see event2 cannot occur.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given that event1 happened initially and no events can happen afterward, event2 cannot occur at any time. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Event1 already happens (initially), so C2 is true immediately.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is already true at the initial moment, C2 does eventually hold (indeed it holds now).

Conclusion
C3 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- The question: is C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") true given the context and definitions?
- Context facts:
  - Initially event1 happened (so event1 is already true at the start).
  - After event1 no other events can happen (so no event2 can occur after that point).
  - Also: if event2 happens then event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 does not occur).
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") cannot be true in this situation because event1 has already occurred and no other events (including event2) can happen afterward.
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". Since event1 has already happened, C2 is true immediately.
- C3 says C2 eventually holds. Because C2 is true right away (at the initial time), C3 is true.

Therefore C3 is True."

Sample responses:

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C1).
- C3: ""C2 ∨ event2"" (i.e., ¬C1 ∨ event2).
- Context additionally states that event2 happened initially (so event2 is true in the scenario).

Step 3 — reason by cases
- Case A: C1 is true. Then event2 indeed happens (since C1 says event2 always happens), so event2 is true and thus C3 (¬C1 ∨ event2) is true.
- Case B: C1 is false. Then C2 (¬C1) is true, so C3 (¬C1 ∨ event2) is true regardless of event2.

Either way C3 is true. The context also directly provides event2 happened, which makes C3 true as well.

Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 ever happened, event2 would have to happen afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the context, event2 does happen (it happened initially). So C1 is true in this scenario.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" This is a disjunction. Since event2 does happen (from the context), the disjunction is true regardless of C2.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does not always happen).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" (C2 ∨ event2).

Step 3 — reason about the situation
- The context explicitly states that event2 happened initially. So the atomic proposition ""event2 happens"" is true (at least at the initial point).
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since ""event2 happens"" is true, C3 is true regardless of whether C2 (that event2 does not always happen) is true or false.

Sample responses:

Reasoning step-by-step (with the usual interpretation that the ""next"" operator requires a successor state):

- Initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means there are no successor states after the initial state (the execution ends at the state where event1 happened).
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Since there is only the initial state and event1 holds there, C1 is true at the initial state (the ""always"" condition is satisfied on the single state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state, so the next-state formula is false (the X operator requires a successor).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false in the initial state, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
First identify what's being asked: C3 is the statement ""C2 always holds"" where
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state""
- C3 = ""C2 always holds""

Now reason through the situation.

1) From the context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal). After event2 no other events can happen as well, but event2 never occurs because the initial event is event1.

2) Evaluate C1: ""Event1 always happens."" On the only possible execution (the initial state where event1 happened and then no further states), every state that exists (just the initial one) has event1 true, so C1 is true in the model.

3) Evaluate C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This requires a successor state. But there is no next state after the initial one (event1 is terminal), so the ""next"" claim fails. Under the standard interpretation of the next operator, Xφ is false at a terminal state. Thus C2 is false in the initial state.

4) Evaluate C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false in the initial state, C3 is false.

Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, C2 is true).
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
- C1 says: ""Event1 always happens.""

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the run reaches a state with no further events).
- (The ""after event2 ..."" clause is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs in the given initial run.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 requires event1 to hold at all future states. But event1 only happened initially and does not reoccur afterward. In the successor/terminal state there is no occurrence of event1, so C1 is false (event1 does not ""always"" happen).

Step 4 — evaluate C2 in the initial state
- C2 requires that in the next state C1 holds. The next state is the terminal state where event1 does not occur, so C1 is false there, hence C2 is false in the initial state.

Step 5 — evaluate C3
- C3 requires C2 to hold in every state. We already found a state (the initial state) where C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C3 asserts “C2 always holds.” We must decide whether C2 is true in every (reachable) state given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
  => Once event2 has happened (which is the initial state), no further events can occur; that is the (only) reachable state.
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. Formally: event2 → event1.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. Formally: (C1) → event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 in the actual system
- In the initial/only state event2 has happened, but event1 does not (there is no way for event1 to happen after event2, and the context does not state event1 occurred). Thus the antecedent of C1 (event2) is true while its consequent (event1) is false, so C1 is false in the reachable state.
- C2 is the implication “if C1 holds then event2 happens.” Since C1 is false in the reachable state, the implication is vacuously true there.
- There are no other reachable states (no further events can occur), so C2 holds in all reachable states.

Conclusion
- C3 (“C2 always holds”) is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true (hence C3 true, since ""always"" here means it holds given the described situation).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (event2 → event1)
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. (C1 → event2)
- C3: C2 always holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
Event2 does happen (initially). Given ""after event2, no other events can happen"" and that event2 is the initial event, event1 does not happen. So the antecedent of C1 is true but the consequent is false, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Because C1 is false, the implication C1 → event2 is true (vacuously true). So C2 holds in the given situation.

Step 5 — conclude about C3
C3 claims C2 always holds. Given the situation, C2 is true, so C3 is True.

Sample responses:
We want to evaluate C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens.""

1) From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen → event1 does not occur in the actual scenario. So C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.

2) C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" That implication is true: if C1 were true it would imply event1, and in the actual model the antecedent C1 is false so the implication is vacuously true. Therefore C2 holds.

3) C3 = (C2 holds) OR (event1 happens). Since C2 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the context says:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
So event1 does not occur at any time (there is no opportunity for it to happen).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false, because event1 never happens in the given scenario.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" As a material implication, this is true: the antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" We have C2 true and event1 false, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is true or false in the given context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 cannot occur later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event2 happened initially and is terminal, event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" As a material implication, this is true in the actual situation because the antecedent C1 is false (vacuous truth). It is also conceptually true: if event1 always happens, then in particular event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Since C2 is true, the disjunction C3 is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
They are syntactically identical conditionals. Any formula of the form P -> P is a logical tautology (it is always true).

Step 3 — use the context (consistency check)
- The context states event2 happened initially and that after event2 no other events can happen. That does not contradict either C1 or C2; in fact event2 did occur, so the antecedent and consequent of each hold in the actual sequence. In any case, P -> P holds regardless of whether P is true or false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- Since C1 is true and C2 is the same statement, ""If C1 holds then C2 holds"" is true. More generally, C1 -> C2 is a tautology because C1 and C2 are identical.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 states: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p) and is always true.
- C2 is identical to C1, so it is also always true.

Step 3 — combine:
- Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" has a true antecedent and a true consequent, so the implication itself is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""  
C2: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""  
Both C1 and C2 are the same tautological statement (P → P). Such implications are always true in any scenario.

Step 3 — consequence for C3:
C3 says ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true (a tautology) and C2 is true (the same tautology), the implication C1 → C2 is true. In fact, because C1 and C2 are identical tautologies, C3 is necessarily true.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p); it is always true.
- C2 is the same tautology, so it is also always true.

Step 3 — relate to the context (optional)
- The context implies event2 happens initially and then event1 must happen; that only reinforces that event1 does occur, but it isn't needed because C1 and C2 are already tautologically true.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- Since C1 is true (and C2 is true), the disjunction C3 (""C1 or C2"") is true.

Final answer:

C3 is True.

Brief reasoning: C1 and C2 are both instances of the tautology ""event1 → event1"", so each holds. Their disjunction C3 therefore holds. Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
C3 asserts ""C1 holds or C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine each condition:
C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication P → P, which is always true.
C2: identical to C1, so also always true.

Step 3 — trace events (consistency check):
From the context, event2 happens initially and forces event1 to happen afterward; event1 is terminal. That makes event1 true in the actual scenario, but that is unnecessary: C1 and C2 are already true as logical tautologies regardless of whether event1 occurs.

Step 4 — determine C3:
Since at least one of C1 or C2 holds (in fact both do), the disjunction C3 is true.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:

They are the same proposition.

Step 3 — reason about the implication:
An implication P → Q is always true when P and Q are the same proposition (P → P is a tautology). Also, from the context we know event1 did happen initially, so both C1 and C2 are true in the given scenario, making the implication true as well.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
They are the same formula.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate C1 and C2
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 also happens.
- So both event1 and event2 happen, hence C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- Since C1 and C2 are identical, C1 → C2 is a tautology (P → P).
- Concretely here, antecedent is true and consequent is true, so the implication is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"", where C1 and C2 are both ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine each condition under the context:
- Context says event1 happened initially.
- Context also says after event1, event2 must happen — so event2 happens as well.
- Therefore ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition. An implication p → p is always true; here both C1 and C2 are true, so the implication holds.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says ""C2 always holds."" We must decide if, given the context, C2 is true at all times (i.e., C3 is true).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So ""event2 happens"" is true in the run.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 will occur later.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So the run is: event2 (initial), then event1, then nothing else.)

Step 3 — examine C2
- C2 = ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" C1 = ""Event1 always happens.""
- In the run described, event2 does happen (initially). Therefore the disjunction ""event2 happens or C1 holds"" is true.

Step 4 — does C2 always hold?
- The fact that event2 happened at the start is a persistent fact about the run; it does not cease to be true later. Thus C2 remains true at all times in the run.
- Whether or not C1 is true is irrelevant to C2 here because event2 already makes C2 true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
You ask whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs in the model/run).
- Whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterwards.
- After event1 happens no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event2 happened initially and event2 implies event1 must happen, event1 does indeed occur in this run. Since the context fixes that initial event2 happened and forces event1, C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), and C1 holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C1 is a global consequence of the context (event1 is guaranteed), so C2 (which is event2 or C1) is true in all states/runs; therefore C2 always holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred in the run).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after that initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs the run ends).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 does occur in the run. There is no allowed run in which event1 does not happen. So C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since event2 did happen initially, C2 is true; also C1 holds, so C2 is true regardless.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 (""C2 always holds"")
- C3 asserts that C2 is true in all runs (i.e., always). We have established C1 holds in all runs (because event2 initially forces event1), and C2 is true whenever C1 holds. Therefore C2 holds in all runs. Hence C3 is true.

Sample responses:
You ask whether C3 is true or false. Step-by-step:

1. Identify the question: C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" We need to determine whether C2 is false (so C3 is true) or C2 is true (so C3 is false).

2. Understand the conditions:
   - Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial state, event1 is true.
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after the initial one will have event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3. Examine the hypothesis components:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" So C1 is true in the initial state (because event1 happened initially).
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state (after the initial event1) must be one where event2 has happened. In that next state event1 does not happen, so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Conclusion: True.
---
Step 1 — parse the context
- Initial state S0: event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so in the next state S1 event2 occurs.
- After event2, no other events can happen → S1 is terminal (no event1 in S1).

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means: in S0, C2 asserts that event1 holds in S1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" is the negation of C2.

Step 3 — evaluate on the timeline
- In S1 event2 happens and, by the context, no other events (so event1 does not happen in S1).
- Therefore C1 is false in S1, so C2 is false in S0.
- Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true in S0.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and set up states
- Initially (state s0) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so in the next state (s1) event2 occurs.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so s1 is terminal.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event1 happens."" At s0 this is true (event1 happened). At s1 this is false (s1 is the event2 state; event1 does not happen there).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C1 is true in s1. As just noted, C1 is false in s1, so C2 is false (in the initial state s0).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- We must evaluate C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Decide whether that disjunction is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After any event1, event2 must happen. After any event2, event1 must happen. This forces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There is some future time at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (At every point in time, it is true that event2 will eventually happen.)
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" (Either event2 happens (now/at some point) or the global property C2 holds.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
- From the initial event1 and the rules, the next event must be event2. So event2 does occur; C1 is true.
- Because events alternate indefinitely (every event2 is followed by an event1 and vice versa), from any point in time there will be a future event2. Thus ""event2 eventually happens"" is true at every time point, so C2 is true.
- C3 is a disjunction; since C2 is true, C3 is true regardless of the other disjunct.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Starting from the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will indeed occur. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" From any point in the execution, because the rules force alternation (after event2 comes event1 and after event1 comes event2), no matter the current state there will always be a future event2. Thus C1 is true at every point, so C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" We have already shown C2 holds (and event2 does happen as well), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the statement: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the given rules
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
These rules force an infinite alternation: ... event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

Step 3 — check C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True: immediately after the initial event1, the rule requires event2 to happen.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True: at every future point in the alternating sequence, there will be another event2 in the future (after any event1 comes event2, and after any event2 comes event1 and then again event2), so from every time point C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is a disjunction: either event2 happens (at some time) or C2 holds. Since we established C2 holds, the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen. So C1 is True.
2. C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" That is: (event1 does not happen) → (event1 happens). Since C1 is True and event1 is False, the implication is False. So C2 does not hold.
3. C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false, given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen.
Taken together, since event2 has already happened at the initial moment and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time (neither before the initial moment is available, nor after).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context (event2 already happened and no events can happen afterward), event1 indeed does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a conditional with antecedent C1. Since C1 is true, the conditional asserts that event1 happens. But we have established event1 does not happen. Therefore the conditional is false (true antecedent, false consequent).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" We found C2 to be false, so the statement that C2 does not hold is true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
The question is whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C2.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore, once the initial event2 has occurred, event1 cannot happen at any time.
- (The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur.)

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, this is true (event1 cannot happen because event2 already occurred and is terminal).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 requires event1 to happen. But event1 does not happen, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- C3 states ""C2 does not hold."" We have determined C2 is false, so C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: C1 and C2 (so C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 does not happen"").

Step 2 — Use the context rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 does happen (it is required to occur after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → implies alternating occurrences but does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions:
- Because event1 must happen, the statement ""Event1 does not happen"" is false. So C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 (C1 and C2) is false as well.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C3 (which says ""Event1 does not happen"" AND ""Event1 does not happen"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 is required to occur at some point after the initial event2.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This creates an alternating requirement, but irrelevant once event1 is required to occur.)

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. This contradicts ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" because event2 did happen initially, so event1 must occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is C1 AND C2. Since both C1 and C2 are false, their conjunction C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

- The context says: after event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 did happen initially, event1 must occur afterward.
- Therefore Event1 does happen (and indeed the constraints force alternating occurrences of event1 and event2).

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide the truth of C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds.""

- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not always happen).
- C3: ""Event2 happens OR C2 holds.""

Step 3 — trace events and evaluate:
- The context explicitly states event2 happened (initially). Therefore the proposition ""Event2 happens"" is true.
- An OR statement is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since ""Event2 happens"" is true, C3 is true regardless of whether C2 holds or not.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify: C3 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine conditions: The context states that initially event2 happened (so ""Event2 happens"" is true in this scenario). C1 and C2 are about whether event2 always happens; those do not need to be resolved for the disjunction once one disjunct is true.

Step 3 — trace events: The sequence is event2 then event1 then stop, so event2 does indeed happen.

Conclusion: Because the first disjunct (""Event2 happens"") is true, C3 is true.

Identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Examine each condition
- Context: Initially, event2 happened. Also: after event1, no other events can happen; after event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the context, after event2 no other events can happen, so if event2 happened initially, event1 cannot happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (it does not hold in the next state), C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" The disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. The context states that event2 happened initially, so the first disjunct is true.

Conclusion
- C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
We are asked whether C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

1) Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and after event1 likewise). So from the initial state there is no successor state with any further event.

2) C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (because event2 occurred and no further events can happen), so C1 is false.

3) C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false in the initial (and only) state, C2 is false.

4) C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Event2 does happen (it happened initially), so the disjunction is true regardless of C2.

Therefore C3 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts ""C1 holds and C2 holds"". Since C1 and C2 are the same statement (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""), C3 is equivalent to the single claim ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — what the context says
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 definitely occurs (in the history).
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (following the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1/C2 given the context
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the context, event2 has already happened initially, so any occurrence of event1 will have event2 occurring as well (it happened beforehand). Therefore the implication is true.
- C2 is identical to C1, so it is also true.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- Both C1 and C2 hold, so their conjunction C3 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 and C2 are both ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — so C3 is true iff that implication holds (it’s the same implication twice).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence(s):
- The only allowed sequence consistent with the constraints is: event2 (initial) → event1 → stop.

Step 4 — evaluate the implication:
- In the only possible sequence, whenever event1 happens, event2 has already happened. So ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is true.

Conclusion:
C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds (i.e., both identical conditionals hold).

Step 2 — Examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true at the start).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — Reason about the conditionals
- Because event2 happened initially, in every allowed run event2 is true.
- Therefore any occurrence of event1 (which in fact must occur after the initial event2) will have event2 having happened. So the conditional “if event1 happens, then event2 happens” is satisfied.
- Both C1 and C2 are true (they are the same statement), hence their conjunction C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 is the claim ""C2 always holds"". You must decide whether, given the scenario, C3 is true or false.

Step 2 — understand the conditions and timeline
- Initial state S0: event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur in the next state S1.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means that once event2 has occurred (in S1), there will be no future occurrences of any events (and in particular no further event2).

Step 3 — examine C1, C2, C3 at relevant states
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - At S0, C1 is true (S1 has event2).
  - At S1, C1 is false (the next state cannot have event2 because no events happen after event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point C1 is true).
  - At S0, C2 is true (C1 already holds at S0).
  - At S1, C2 is false — there is no future state where C1 becomes true, because no further event2 can occur.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, eventually C1 holds).
  - Since C2 is false at S1, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future state C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, C2 is true).
You ask whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — the system trace from the context
- State0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By the requirement ""after event1, event2 must happen"", State1: event2 happens.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"", so from State2 onward there are no events.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at relevant states
- At State0: C1 is true (event2 occurs in the next state). Hence C2 holds at State0 (C1 already holds).
- At State1: C1 is false (the next state has no events, so event2 does not happen next). C2 is false at State1 because there is no future state where C1 becomes true (no further events will occur).
- Since C2 is false at State1, C2 does not hold at every state.

Conclusion
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" So we must decide whether in every state along the execution, the formula C2 is true.

Step 2 — clarify the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened (call that state S0).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — so in the state immediately after the state where event1 occurred (S1) event2 occurs.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — once event2 has occurred (in S1), later states have no further events.

Step 3 — interpret the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — holds in a state if the immediate successor state contains event2.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — from the current state there exists some future state where C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — in every state along the run, C2 is true.

Step 4 — trace the states
- S0: initially event1 occurred. By the rule, S1 contains event2. So at S0, C1 is true (because the next state S1 has event2). Hence C2 is true at S0 (C1 already holds).
- S1: contains event2. By the rule, after event2 no other events happen, so S2 and later contain no event2. At S1, C1 (""event2 in the next state"") is false (S2 does not have event2). Are there any future states where C1 is true? No — once event2 has happened no future state will have event2 in its successor, so C1 never becomes true later. Thus C2 is false at S1.
- Because C2 is false at S1, C2 is not true in every state.

Conclusion
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False."

Sample responses:
First, what’s being asked: is C3 (""Event2 happens and C2 holds"") true given the context?

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. Also, if event1 happens then event2 must happen.
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this naturally as “from now on, at every moment/event step event2 holds” (i.e., a persistent/always property). The single initial occurrence of event2 does not make C1 true, because after that point no further events occur and event2 does not continuously hold at subsequent moments.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" For C2 to be true there must be some future point from which C1 holds forever. But since after the initial event2 no events can occur, there is no way for the system to start satisfying “event2 always happens” at any later point. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: requires both “Event2 happens” and C2. While the first part (“Event2 happens”) is true (it happened initially), the second part C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning step‑by‑step:

- “Initially, event2 happened.” So event2 has occurred in the initial state (event2 happens is true).
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” That means from the moment after that occurrence there is no future action that could falsify any property that depends on “event2 has happened.” In particular, there is no possible future in which event2 has not happened.
- Interpreting C1 (“Event2 always happens”) as the invariant “event2 has happened” holds in all future states: once event2 has happened and no further events can occur, that invariant is true from that point onward. So C1 holds.
- C2 is “C1 eventually holds.” Since C1 already holds (immediately after the initial event2), C2 is true.
- C3 is the conjunction “Event2 happens and C2 holds.” Both conjuncts are true, so C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 has occurred. The rules force an alternation: after event1, event2 must occur; after event2, event1 must occur. So the very next state after the initial one must have event2 (not event1).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state""): False (the next state has event2).
- C2 (""C1 does not hold""): True (since C1 is false).
- C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens""): True, because C2 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the claim ""C2 holds or event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. event1 does not happen in the next state).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces that in the next state event2 occurs (so event1 does not occur in the next state).
- The further rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" affects the state after that, not the immediate next state.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 is true.
- C3 is ""C2 or event1 happens"" — since C2 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must decide the truth of C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens.""

Step 2 — formalize the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens in the next state. Call this p.
- C2: C1 does not hold = ¬p.
- C3: C2 holds or event1 happens = (¬p) ∨ p.

Step 3 — logical evaluation:
- (¬p) ∨ p is a tautology (always true).

Step 4 — check against the given event sequence:
- From the context, starting with event1 then event2 then event1, the next state after the initial event1 actually has event2, so p is false and ¬p is true; C3 is therefore true. If instead p were true, C3 would still be true because of the p disjunct.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., at every state from that point on, C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., there is some future state where, from that state onward, C1 is true in every state.

Step 3 — trace the possible states from the context
- Initially (state S0) event1 has happened.
- The context says: after event1, no other events can happen. So the next state S1 exists (after S0) but no events occur there (and it is a dead-end).
- Event2 never occurs on this path, so the ""after event2"" clause is irrelevant.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions on this trace
- At S0: C1 requires that event1 happen in the next state (S1). But in S1 no events happen, so event1 does not happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false at S0.
- Since C1 is already false at S0, ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false at S0. In S1 there is no next state with event1, so C1 is false there too, so C2 is false at S1 as well.
- Therefore there is no state at which C2 becomes true. Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences in any future state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the previous line).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, event1 happens in the next state).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future state, from that state onward C1 holds in every state).

Step 3 — reason about the timeline:
- Since event1 already happened initially and no events can happen afterward, in the next state there are no events — in particular, event1 does not occur in that next state. So C1 is false at the initial state (and at every state, because no future event1 occurrences ever happen).
- Because C1 is false everywhere, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Since C2 never becomes true at any future state, C3 (""eventually C2 holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That asks whether at some future point (possibly the current one) it becomes true that C2 holds from that point onward.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" C2 is true at a state iff in every state from that point onward C1 is true.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" C1 is true at a state iff the immediate successor state has event1 occur.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen — so the run is terminal after that occurrence (there is no future event occurrence after the state where event1 happened).
- (The clause about event2 also being terminal is irrelevant because event2 does not occur here.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- At the initial state event1 has happened, but there is no successor state in which event1 can happen (after event1 no events happen). So C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false at the initial state.
- Since C1 is false at the initial state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false at the initial state (and there are no later states where C1 could start holding).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 requires that at some point in the future C2 becomes true. But C2 is never true (it fails at the initial state and can never become true later because there are no further events/states where C1 could begin to hold always).
- Therefore C3 is false.

False"

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
C3 asks whether ""C2 eventually holds"" is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 has occurred at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur at any later time).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (and there is no time before the initial moment to consider).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 has happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" The antecedent (event1 happens) is true and the consequent (C1) is true, so C2 is true now.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds already at the initial moment, it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually). So C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C3 says “C2 eventually holds.” We must decide whether that is true given the context and definitions.

Step 2 — understand the facts
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 already occurred and no future events occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 is true now.
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” Event1 did happen and C1 is true, so C2 is true now.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Because C2 holds already (immediately), it certainly holds at some time in the future (eventually).

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C3 states: ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions and the C-claims
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened. (So at time 0, event1 is true.)
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterward.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal; once it occurs nothing further happens.)
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event1 → (event2 ∨ event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 given the context
- Because event1 has happened initially, the right-hand side of C1 (event1) is true. Thus C1 is true at that time.
- Therefore the implication event1 → (event2 ∨ event1) is true at that time (indeed it is true because the consequent is true whenever event1 holds).
- So C2 holds immediately (at the initial time).

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- Since C2 holds already at the initial time, ""C2 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- Determine truth of C3 under the given scenario.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event1 happens and event2 happens. From the context both events do occur, so C1 is True.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. In the actual scenario event2 happens only after event1, and C1 (both events happened) is true; so the implication in this scenario is True.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3: If event1 happens, then C2 holds. Event1 does happen (initially). Given event1, event2 must happen, and as noted above C2 is true in that situation. Therefore the conditional in C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 also happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (No effect on the two above.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Both happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Event2 does happen and C1 is true, so the implication is true (true antecedent and true consequent).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, and we have just shown C2 is true, so the implication is true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.

We are asked whether C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 1 — facts from context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Given event1 did happen, event2 will (and therefore does) happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (No effect on the conditionals beyond fixing the sequence.)

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — true, since both occur in the timeline.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" In the actual timeline event2 does happen; C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, and we just saw C2 holds, so C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the hypothesis
- C1 says ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"" in the current state.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event2 happens in the next state.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event2 happens two steps ahead.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- The context also says ""after event2, no other events can happen."" That forbids event2 from occurring in any state after the initial one (and likewise ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C3
- Because no events can happen after event2, event2 does not happen in the next state, so C1 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is false.
- If C2 is false in the next state, then C2 cannot hold in the following state either, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened. Also we are told that after event2 no other events can happen (so the initial state has no successor state).
- C1 (""event2 happens and event2 happens"") is true in the initial state (it just asserts event2 happened).
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state (because after event2 no events can occur), and under the standard semantics of the next operator, Xϕ is false when there is no successor. So C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3 asserts ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since there is no next state, there is no state in which C2 can hold; therefore C3 is false.

Thus C3 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step by step:

1. What is being asked: C3 is the statement ""C2 holds in the next state"" evaluated from the initial situation.

2. Evaluate C1: C1 says ""event2 happens and event2 happens."" Since initially event2 happened, C1 is true in the initial state.

3. Evaluate C2: C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C1). But the context says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes the current state terminal — there is no next state. In standard “next” semantics, if there is no successor state then a next-stated formula is false. Therefore C2 is false in the initial state.

4. Evaluate C3: C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C2). Again there is no next state from the initial state, so any ""next"" formula is false. Hence C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. event1 will occur sometime after event2).
  - After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Given the context that after event2 event1 must happen, and C1 is true, C2 is true (in fact event1 will happen).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now (it is true immediately), so there certainly is a time at which C2 holds — hence C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" The context says event2 happened initially, so C1 is true.

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is true and the context requires that after event2 event1 must happen, event1 will indeed occur. Thus C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is already true (hence it holds now), so it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually). Therefore C3 is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide if C3 is true.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened → C1 is true (event2 does happen).
- The context also says ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → given C1, event1 will happen, so C2 is true now.
- ""C2 eventually holds"" means C2 is true at some time (now counts as ""eventually"").

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. C1 is false)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (i.e. C2 is false)

Step 2 — use the context about events:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never actually occurs. That doesn't change the truth of C1: an implication P → P is true whether P actually occurs (both sides true) or not (vacuously true when P is false).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 is true (tautology).
- C2 asserts C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 asserts C2 is false; since C2 is indeed false, C3 is true.

Conclusion:
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not happen (there is no time when event1 occurs given the initial event2 and the ""no further events"" conditions).

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P) and is always true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, the statement that C2 does not hold is true.

Therefore C3 is True.

True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Goal: decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

2. Interpret the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, the run ends).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so any occurrence of event1 would also terminate the run).

3. Examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 happens initially and that prevents any further events; there is no opportunity for event1 to occur (and there is no earlier time before the initial event2). Thus C1 is false in the actual system.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (not even true in the single possible initial run), C2 is false.

4. Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true because C2 is false.

Thus the correct answer is True.
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 happens, nothing can happen afterwards.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 happens, nothing can happen afterwards.)
- Hypothesis:
  - C1: event1 happens and event2 happens.
  - C2: C1 always holds. (i.e., C1 is true in all relevant cases / at all times)
  - C3: C2 does not hold.

Step 3 — Reason about possible event sequences
- Because event2 happened initially, it occurs at the start. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no event can occur at any later time once event2 has occurred.
- Could event1 also have happened? For C1 to be true both events must happen. There are two possibilities:
  1. event1 happened before event2 — impossible here because event2 is stated to have happened initially (at the start); there is no prior time for event1 to have occurred.
  2. event1 happened after event2 — forbidden by ""after event2, no other events can happen.""
  3. event1 happened exactly simultaneously with event2 — the context only states ""Initially, event2 happened"" and does not state event1 happened initially; the natural reading is that only event2 is given as having happened initially. Even if simultaneity were allowed, the context does not assert event1 happened, so we cannot conclude both happened.
- Therefore C1 (both event1 and event2 happen) does not hold under the given context.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2 and C3
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") requires C1 to be true; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Event2 has happened initially, and because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur (there is no time after event2 when event1 could happen). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, it does not always hold. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" That is true, because C2 is false.

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, event1 happens in the next state).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point, from then on C1 is always true).

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once we are in the initial state (where event1 has happened), there are no further events in subsequent states.
- The clause ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (we already have event1 and nothing can happen after it).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- C1 is false: in the next state no events occur, so event1 does not ""happen in the next state.""
- C2 is false: since C1 is already false now, it is not true that C1 holds at every state.
- C3 is false: there is no future point at which C2 becomes true (nothing changes after the initial state), so C2 will never eventually hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G X event1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F G X event1).
So the question is whether there is some point in every trace after which, in every future state, event1 holds in the next state.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any later states).
- After event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (no events occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- At the initial state: C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false, because after the initial event1 no events (including event1) happen in the next state.
- C2 (""always C1"") is therefore false (C1 is already false at the initial state).
- C3 (""eventually C2"") would require that at some future point C1 holds in every subsequent state. But since after the initial event1 no events ever occur, C1 never becomes true at any state, so C2 never becomes true at any point.

Final answer:
False
---
Let's name the initial state S0.

1) From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred in S0.
2) ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened in S0, no further events can occur in any future state. In particular, there is no future state in which a new event occurs.
3) C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" In the next state after S0 there are no events (by 2), so event1 does not happen in that next state. Therefore C1 is false at S0.
4) C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 is already false at S0, C2 does not hold (it fails immediately).
5) C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 never holds (it is false now and nothing can change because no events can happen), C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
C3 asserts that C2 always holds (i.e., C2 is true in the given scenario at all times).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
  - After event1, event2 must happen. (This is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs in the given timeline.)
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens (event2 ∨ event1).
  Since event2 has happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens (C1 ∨ event1). This simplifies to (event2 ∨ event1), i.e. C2 is equivalent to C1, so C2 is true initially.

Step 3 — trace possible evolutions
Because after event2 no other events can happen, there is no future point at which event1 could occur and no future point at which event2 could cease to have happened. The fact that event2 happened remains true, so (event2 ∨ event1) remains true at all times.

Conclusion
C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, there are no further states with new events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" In the initial state event2 happened, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" We must check whether C2 holds in every reachable state.

Step 4 — trace possible sequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, there are no other reachable states beyond the initial one. The only relevant state is the initial state where event2 (and thus C1 and C2) hold.

Conclusion
- C2 holds in the only reachable state, so C2 always holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no future events occur after that initial moment).
- After event1, event2 must happen (a conditional, vacuously satisfied if event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 has happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is true, so the disjunction is true; C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" We check whether C2 holds at all times in the scenario. At the initial moment C2 is true. Because no events can happen after event2, the situation cannot change, so C2 remains true at all future times. (Also, the conditional about event1 does not force any violation: event1 cannot occur after event2, and if event1 never occurs the conditional is vacuously satisfied.)

Step 4 — conclusion
C2 is true now and remains true forever under the given constraints, so C3 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: Initially, event1 happened.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (because event1 did happen initially).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (C2 says C1 is false, i.e. event1 happens).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds at the initial moment (event1 has happened), so C2 holds now and therefore holds at some time ≥ now — so ""eventually"" is satisfied.

Step 3 — check consistency with other context rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" do not contradict the above: event1 happening makes C2 true and does not prevent C2 from holding.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true or false given the event constraints.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial moment event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any further events after that point, but does not change the fact that event1 already happened.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the initial fact, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is true (already true at the initial moment).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some time (including the present) at which C2 is true.

Step 3 — trace and conclude
- C2 holds immediately (at the initial moment) because event1 did happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.
- Therefore C2 does indeed ""eventually"" hold (it already holds), so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C2 will be true at some point (including now).

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is false (event1 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (immediately).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is already true at the initial moment, it certainly holds at some time (now), so it ""eventually"" holds.

Step 1 — identify the question
C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 occurs later).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Because C1 is true, C2 requires event1 to happen. But event1 cannot happen: event2 has already occurred initially and no events can happen after event2, and nothing can have happened before the initial event2. Therefore event1 is false, so the implication C2 (true -> false) is false.

Step 4 — conclude C3
C2 does not hold, so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what's asked:
C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event2 happened → E2 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → if E1 then E2.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once E2 has occurred, no further events (including E1) can occur afterward.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- C1: E2 or E1. Since E2 is true initially, C1 is true.
- C2: If C1 holds, then E1 happens. That would require E1 to be true whenever C1 is true.
  Here C1 is true (because E2 happened), but E1 need not be true: given E2 happened initially and no events can occur after E2, there is no basis to conclude E1 occurred. So C2 does not hold.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 does happen.)
  2. After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 must follow.)
  3. After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given (1), event2 does happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is C1 ⇒ event1. Since C1 is True, C2 requires that event1 happens.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence and check C2
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- There is no information that event1 occurred before the initial event2. So event1 does not occur in the allowed sequence.
- Therefore the consequent of C2 (""event1 happens"") is false while its antecedent C1 is true, so C2 is false (does not hold).

Step 4 — Conclusion about C3
- C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" Since we found C2 to be false, C3 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The question asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"". Since event1 happened initially, C1 is true (at the initial moment).
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"". That reduces to ""event1 happens"", so C2 is true at the initial moment as well.
- C3 requires C2 to hold at all times. But events are occurrences, and only event1 happened (initially); after event1 no other events occur. Event1 does not keep occurring at every time point, so C2 does not hold at times after the initial moment.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 never gets to happen because event1 already happened and blocks further events.)
- C1: ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (redundant conjuncts).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. at every time point / always, C2 is true.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- event1 happens initially, so C1 and C2 are true at that initial moment.
- After that moment no further events occur, so at later times ""event1 happens"" is not happening again (event occurrences are instantaneous). Thus C2 is not true at those later times.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because C2 is true only at the initial instant and not at all times, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial moment, event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So nothing new happens after the initial moment.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given the context, C1 is true at the initial moment.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" That is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" So C2 is true at the initial moment.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires C2 to be true at every time point (i.e., at the initial moment and at all times after).

Step 4 — reason about truth over time
C2 asserts that event1 happens. The occurrence of an event is true at the moment it happens but not at arbitrary later times. Although no other events occur after the initial moment, that does not make the occurrence of event1 true at all later times; event1 happened once at the start but does not ""keep happening"" forever. Therefore C2 is not true at all future times, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C3 is the statement: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- The context says event1 happened initially, so C1 is true (the disjunction is satisfied by event1).

Step 3 — examine C2
- C2: ""C1 always holds.""
- Since C1 is already true (because event1 happened), the disjunction remains true at all times (the fact that event1 happened is a persistent fact about the run). Therefore C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is an implication: if event2 happens then C2 holds.
- C2 is true regardless of whether event2 happens, so the implication is true whenever its antecedent is true.
- Thus C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- What’s asked: Is C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") true given the context?

- Examine C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" In the context, event1 happens initially (and event2 must happen afterwards), so C1 is true.

- Examine C2: ""C1 always holds."" The context fixes the sequence: event1 happens, then event2, and no other sequences are allowed. There is no permitted situation in which neither event1 nor event2 happens, so C1 holds in every permitted situation — hence C2 is true.

- Examine C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 does happen in the actual (and required) sequence, and we have just established C2 holds. Thus the implication is true.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the claim: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether that claim is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So the only allowed sequence is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, then nothing else.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the context, at least event1 happens (and in fact event2 also happens), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because event1 has happened initially, the disjunction in C1 is true from the start and remains true in every state of the execution (event1 has happened already, and event2 will also happen). Thus C1 holds in every state, so C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 says: if event2 happens, then C2 holds. We have established that C2 is true in the given context. An implication whose consequent is true is true; moreover, in every possible execution consistent with the context event2 does happen and C2 still holds. Therefore the implication is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in every allowed timeline).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does occur in every allowed timeline).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to the implication).

Step 3 — reason about the implication:
- In every timeline consistent with the context, event1 has already happened (initially). Therefore whenever event2 happens, event1 has (already) happened. So ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C3:
- C1 is true (and C2 is identical, so true), so the disjunction C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 asserts (C1 holds) OR (C2 holds). We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true in every timeline.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 does occur (and occurs after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.
  (C1 and C2 are the same statement.)

Step 4 — reason about truth:
- In every possible timeline from the context, event1 happened initially and event2 (when it happens) comes after that. Therefore whenever event2 happens, event1 has already happened. So the implication ""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is true.
- Thus C1 is true (and so is C2), so C1 ∨ C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 says ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" C1 and C2 are identical: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" So C3 is true exactly when that implication holds.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 occurs in every allowed execution (at the start).
- After event1, event2 must happen. So in every allowed execution, event2 occurs at some point after the initial event1.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to the implication except that event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 is true initially and event2 must occur after event1, any occurrence of event2 in any allowed execution is preceded (or at least accompanied by) the initial event1.
- Therefore it is impossible, under the given context, for event2 to occur without event1 having happened.

Conclusion
- C1 (""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"") is true; C2 is the same, so it is also true. Hence C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

True

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 does not and cannot occur at any later point.

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.

3. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true (true ∨ anything = true). So C2 holds.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C1 is a tautology and therefore holds at every time/state, C2 (which depends on C1) also holds at every time/state. Thus C3 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts: ""C2 always holds.""

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the formula event2 → event2, which is a tautology (always true).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is always true, the disjunction (C1 ∨ event2) is always true as well — C2 is true in every state regardless of whether event2 occurs.

Step 3 — trace the event sequences / global truth:
- The context about event1 and event2 does not change the logical status above: C2 is true in every reachable state (and thus ""always holds"") because it contains a tautology.

Conclusion:
- C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The question asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is always true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is always true, the disjunction is always true regardless of whether event2 ever occurs.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is always true (by C1 being a tautology), C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and the formulas
- Context: initially event1 happens. After event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen. So event1 happens at the initial state and event2 never happens at any state.
- C1: (event2 → event1) — at a given state, if event2 happens then event1 happens.
- C2: Eventually C1 holds (there is some future state where C1 is true).
- C3: In the next state, C2 holds (i.e., at the successor state, eventually C1 holds).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- Since event2 never happens in any state, the implication event2 → event1 is true in every state (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- Therefore C1 is true immediately (and everywhere).
- If C1 is already true now, then ""eventually C1"" is true now (it holds immediately). So C2 is true in every state.
- In particular, in the next state C2 holds (because C1 holds there), so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis formulas mean (reading in standard linear temporal logic style)
- C1 is the state formula: (event2 → event1).
- C2 is: F C1 (C1 eventually holds).
- C3 is: X C2 (C2 holds in the next state).

Step 2 — consequences of the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at the current/initial state event1 is true).
- “After event1, no other events can happen” (and also “after event2, no other events can happen”): once event1 has occurred, no future state can have event2 (nor any other new event). We therefore never see event2 at any future state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1 (event2 → event1): since event2 never occurs in any state, the implication is true in every state (vacuously true).
- C2 (F C1): C1 already holds now (indeed at every state), so “eventually C1” is true immediately.
- C3 (X C2): in the next state C1 still holds (and hence C2 holds there), so X C2 is true.

Conclusion
C3 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never occurs in any reachable future (once event1 has happened it prevents any further events, including event2).

- C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens""): because event2 never occurs, this implication is vacuously true in every reachable state. So C1 holds now.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds""): since C1 already holds in the initial state, there is a (trivial) future point where C1 holds (indeed it holds immediately), so C2 is true in the initial state.

- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): the next state after the initial one still has event1 in its history and still forbids any further events, so the situation is unchanged — C1 continues to hold, hence C2 continues to hold at the next state.

Therefore C3 is True."

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

- Interpret the conditions:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction repeats the same atomic claim).
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. event1 does not happen.
  - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the immediate successor state, event1 does not happen.

- From the context: initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 can never occur (it cannot occur initially and cannot occur afterwards).

- Hence C1 is false (event1 does not happen), so C2 is true now. Because event1 can never happen in any future state, C2 remains true in the next state as well.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" (equivalent to ""Event1 happens"").
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event1 does not happen"".
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" = ""In the next state, Event1 does not happen"".

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → no events (including event1) can ever happen after the initial state.
- The obligation ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- C1 is false (event1 never happens).
- C2 is true (¬C1).
- In the next state event1 still does not happen, so C2 is true there as well.

Therefore C3 is True. 

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 occurred, and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" prevents any further events ever occurring.  
- Therefore event1 cannot happen at any time. So C1 (event1 happens) is false, and C2 (C1 does not hold) is true in the initial state.  
- Since no events can happen after the initial state, event1 still does not happen in the next state, so C2 also holds in the next state. Hence C3 is true."

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event1 has happened and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will (at least) happen following that initial event1.
- After that event2, the rule forces event1 again, and then again event2, and so on. Thus event2 occurs (indeed infinitely often).

- C2 is true (same statement).
- Therefore C3 (both C1 and C2) is true.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., event2 will occur after that event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate indefinitely).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- We start with event1 (given).
- By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will (eventually) occur.
- Therefore C1 is satisfied; since C2 is the same, C2 is satisfied.
- Thus C3 (C1 AND C2) is satisfied.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
- We must decide whether C3 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine the conditions with the context:
- Context says event1 happened initially. So ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.

(Constraints about events after event1 or after event2 do not contradict the above: event1 already happened initially, so C1 is satisfied and C2 is false.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., not C2). Logically, C3 = not(C2) = not(not(C1)) = C1, so C3 is equivalent to C1.

Step 3 — use the context about events
- The context explicitly says ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means event1 has occurred (so ""event1 eventually happens"" is true).
- The other rules (""after event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"") don't force any contradiction or prevent event1 from having occurred initially.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C1 is true (event1 happened initially), C2 (not C1) is false, and C3 (not C2) is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event1 does not eventually happen).
- C3: C2 does not hold (i.e., C2 is false).

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has happened from the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- After event2, event1 must happen. This is irrelevant to changing the fact that event1 already happened initially; it only constrains sequences where event2 occurs before event1.

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 is true because event1 already happened initially (so “event1 eventually happens” holds).
- C2 asserts the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold — that is, C3 is true (since C2 is false).

Sample responses:
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 says ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" So we must decide whether that conditional is true given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 always happens.""
  These are the same proposition (call it P).

Trace the event constraints:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has happened the run terminates.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened and blocks further events). All executions therefore contain event1 (it happens initially) and then stop.

Two ways to see C3 is true:
1. Logical/tautological view: C3 is P → P. Any proposition implies itself, so P → P is always true.
2. Model view (using the context): C1 (P) is true in this system (event1 occurs in every execution), so C2 (the same P) is also true; thus the implication C1 → C2 holds.

Conclusion: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 always happens.""
  They are the same statement.

Step 3 — trace the event sequences from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs in the given system).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there are no alternative traces where event1 does not occur).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1 (nothing can), so it does not create a counterexample to event1 always happening.

Step 4 — conclude about C3:
- Since C1 and C2 are identical, the implication ""if C1 then C2"" is trivially true (A → A).
- Given the context, C1 and C2 are satisfied, so C3 holds.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: initially event1 happens. After event1 no other events can happen, so the only possible run is the one where event1 happened initially and nothing else happens. Event2 can never occur in any run.
- Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is true in every possible run (it happened initially), and C2 is the same statement so it is also true.
- C3 says ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same (and both true), the implication holds. More generally, an implication from a statement to itself is always true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
The question asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context implies event1 occurs initially and then event2 must occur; after event2 nothing else happens. So event2 does occur at some point on the actual timeline.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the formula p → p, which is a logical tautology; in particular, given event2 does occur its antecedent and consequent are both true, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 holds (indeed C1 is tautologically true), C2 holds. Even if we consider times after event1, C1 still holds, so C2 holds at all times.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C1 is true (tautologically) and thus C2 is always true, C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context and the clauses C1–C2.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication of a proposition by itself) and therefore is true in every state/time.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, the disjunction is always true regardless of whether event1 holds at a given time.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is true at every time (as just shown), C3 is true.

The context about event1 and event2 is irrelevant to this logical chain because C1 is a tautology that guarantees C2 at all times.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s being asked
You are asked whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in every state/point in time.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, the disjunction is always true regardless of whether event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is always true (as shown), C3 is true.

Step 3 — trace vs. context
The context (event1 initially, event2 must follow event1, and event2 is terminal) implies event2 does occur, but that fact is unnecessary here because C1 is a tautology already ensuring C2 holds everywhere.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A). It is always true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true unconditionally, the implication (event2 → C1) is true regardless of whether event2 occurs. So C2 holds.
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" Therefore ""event2 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — combine for C3

Final answer:

We are asked whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false.

1. From the context, event2 happened initially — so ""event2 happens"" is true.
2. C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — a tautology, hence C1 is true.
3. C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen and C1 is true, C2 is true.
4. C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both conjuncts are true, so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis C3 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and event2 happens"". We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P); it is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true unconditionally, the implication (event2 → C1) is true as well (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen.

Step 3 — combine facts for C3
- We have shown C2 holds.
- The context gives that event2 happens.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C3 states: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" We must decide if that implication is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
  So C1 and C2 are the same proposition.

Step 3 — trace the event constraints
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur after that initial event2 (and there is no earlier time before ""initially""). Thus C1 and C2 are both not satisfied in the scenario (event1 does not happen, event2 does).
- Regardless, even if they were both true, they are identical.

Step 4 — evaluate the implication
- An implication ""If C1 then C2"" is true whenever C1 is false (vacuously true), and it is certainly true if C1 and C2 are identical and true. Therefore C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition.

Step 3 — logical implication
- An implication of the form P → P is always true (tautologically true). Whether P actually holds or not is irrelevant: if P holds then P holds; if P doesn't hold the implication still holds vacuously.

Step 4 — relation to the context
- The context about event ordering doesn't change the logical identity C1 = C2, so it doesn't affect the truth of C3.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The hypothesis C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

2. C1 and C2 are the same proposition: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""

3. A conditional ""If P then Q"" is true whenever P and Q are identical (or whenever P is false). Even under the scenario constraints (initially event2 happens and after event2 no other events can occur, which in fact makes ""Event1 and Event2"" impossible), C1 would be false, and a false antecedent makes the implication true.

4. Therefore C3 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis pieces
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (call this ¬p where p = ""event1 happens"")
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally (¬p) → p.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Use the context
- The context says: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So p is true (event1 does happen).
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen, so the scenario is fixed: event1 happens and then nothing else.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false because event1 did happen.
- C2 is the implication (¬p) → p. An implication with a false antecedent is true, and logically (¬p) → p is equivalent to p. Since p is true in the given context, C2 is true.

Step 4 — Does C2 ""always hold""?
- In the given scenario p is true (event1 happened initially) and that fact does not change, so C2 is true in the scenario. Thus C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts that C2 always holds.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially, event1 happened. Also, after event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen.
- Because event1 happened initially, the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false in the actual run.
- A conditional ""If C1 then event1"" is true whenever C1 is false (vacuously true).

Step 3 — trace event sequences:
- The run is determined: event1 occurred initially; no further events can occur. There is no reachable state in which C1 (event1 does not happen) is true in the sense of “event1 never happens” in that run.
- At the initial (and only relevant) state, C1 is false, so C2 holds. There are no other states where C2 could fail.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C2 holds in all relevant states (vacuously true because C1 is false).
- Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing can happen after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs given the previous point).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false in the given context because event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a conditional with an antecedent (C1) that is impossible/false in the system. A conditional with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C2 is true in the given scenario.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true (the antecedent C1 can never hold under the context), C2 holds at all times/points in the model; therefore C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- C3 is the claim ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide if that claim is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after that initial state — at least it cannot be omitted).
- After event1, no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 must happen after event2, and event2 already happened), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means ""in the next state, Event1 does not happen."" Since event1 must happen (following event2), C2 is also false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — this asserts that C2 is false. We have just determined C2 is false, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First, what each claim says:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event1 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e., it is not the case that (event1 does not happen in the next state).

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 happened initially, event1 must happen (in the next state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant to the truth of C2/C3 beyond confirming event1 does occur).

Evaluate the claims:
- C1 is false (event1 does happen).
- C2 asserts C1 is true in the next state. But event1 must happen in the next state, so C1 does not hold there; therefore C2 is false.
- C3 says C2 does not hold. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis pieces
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state, Event1 does not happen).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not the case that in the next state Event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur following the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant for C1/C2 except that event1 does indeed occur).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Because event1 must happen after event2, the statement ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 says ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e., C2 is false. We found C2 is false, so C3 is true.

Sample responses:
First, identify what's being asked:
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P) and is always true, regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.
- C2: identical to C1, so it is also always true.

Trace the events (context) briefly:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen — so event1 does occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen — they alternate. This confirms event1 does occur, but that fact is unnecessary because C1 and C2 are tautologies.

Determine C3:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 is true (and C2 is also true), the disjunction C3 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""  
C2: same as C1.

In classical logic, any formula of the form A → A is a tautology (always true), regardless of whether A actually occurs. So both C1 and C2 are true.

Step 3 — combine into C3
C3 is ""C1 or C2"". Since at least one (indeed both) disjuncts is true, C3 is true.

- C2: same as C1, also a tautology, always true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the statements
- Context:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
  3. After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- Hypotheses:
  - C1: Event1 eventually happens.
  - C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event2 occurs, then event1 will eventually occur).
  - C3: C2 always holds (C2 is a universal/global property).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
- Since event2 happened initially and the context mandates ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will indeed occur at some later time. After that no further events occur. So the run is: event2 → event1 → stop.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims
- C1 is true in this run (event1 does eventually happen).
- C2 matches the given constraint (""after event2, event1 must happen""), so C2 is true.
- C3 asserts that this implication (if event2 then event1 eventually) holds universally — this is exactly the given global constraint. Therefore C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 will eventually occur).
- C3: C2 always holds (i.e., the implication in C2 is true in all executions / at all times).

Step 2 — understand the context rules:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This enforces that whenever event2 occurs, event1 will follow.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)

Step 3 — reason through event sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially and the rule says after event2 event1 must happen, event1 will indeed occur. So C1 is true in the given execution.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is a general constraint: whenever event2 happens, event1 is forced to occur afterwards. That exactly makes C2 true.
- Since that constraint always applies in the system, the implication in C2 holds in every reachable situation — therefore C2 always holds, i.e., C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether the implication C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true at all times given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any run where event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
  3. After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given (1) and (2), event1 does indeed eventually happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This restates (2) (if event2 occurs then event1 will eventually occur), so C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 asserts that C2 holds always. The rules guarantee that whenever event2 occurs, event1 will follow, so the implication in C2 is globally satisfied. There is no allowed behavior in the context that makes ""event2 and not event1 eventually"" true, so C2 holds at all times.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the claim ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", where C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"" and C2 = ""Event1 eventually happens"" (they are the same claim).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.  
- Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" These just restrict what can happen after those events, they do not prevent the initial event1 from having occurred.

Step 3 — reason about the conditions
- Since event1 has already happened initially, the statement ""Event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied (there exists a time at which event1 occurs).
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 = C1 or C2. With C1 true (and C2 true), the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (which is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Context says: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred at the start.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — an OR of two true statements.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event1 already happened, both C1 and C2 hold; the other context constraints (that no events can happen after event1 or event2) do not contradict this.

Conclusion:
- C3 is true.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" The question: is C3 true or false given the context?

Step 2 — examine the context
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred (at the start).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, the trace contains event1 and then nothing else.
- The statement about event2 is irrelevant because event2 does not occur (event1 already occurred initially and prevents further events).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event1 has occurred (initially), the claim ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied. Therefore C1 is true. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is ""C1 or C2"". With C1 true (and C2 true), the disjunction is true.

Sample responses:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" From the next state, event2 must occur (because it must follow event1), and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore from that next state there will be no future occurrence of event1, so ""event1 eventually happens"" does not hold there. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
---
We are asked whether C3 is true.

1) What is being asked: C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" So we must decide whether C2 is false.

2) Examine the conditions:
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since event1 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether, from the next state onward, event1 will eventually happen. The future after the initial event is: event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else can happen. There is no requirement (and in fact no room) for event1 to reoccur in the future. So from the next state perspective, event1 does not eventually happen; C1 is false in the next state. Therefore C2 is false.

3) C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true because the context states that event1 happened initially.
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. from the next state onward event1 will eventually happen. But after the initial event1, the context forces event2 to happen, and after event2 no further events can occur. Thus from the next state there is no guaranteed future occurrence of event1 (it cannot occur after the required event2). Therefore C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true at the start.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after that, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 happens (true), so the disjunction is true regardless of C2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C3 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true (it already occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen. So nothing happens after that initial event.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (see next point).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is false because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after it, so event2 cannot occur at any time.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 happens is true, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Since event1 happens is true, the disjunction is true regardless of C2.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the background facts
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events—including event2—can occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (an implication that does not force event2 to occur).

Step 3 — evaluate the components
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 happens is true, but C1 is false, so C2 (a conjunction) is false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 happens is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of C2.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- Context: After event1, event2 must happen. Since event1 did happen, event2 must (therefore) happen.
- Context: After event2, no other events can happen. (This doesn't prevent event2 from happening.)

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context requirement that event2 must happen, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" is true — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 is true, so ""C2 does not hold"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C3 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 did happen, event2 must occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to truth of occurrence, only forbids later events).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 does not happen (¬E2).
- C2: C1 does not hold → ¬(¬E2) → E2 (so C2 says event2 happens).
- C3: C2 does not hold → ¬(E2) → ¬E2 (so C3 is equivalent to C1: event2 does not happen).

Step 4 — reason through events
- Since event1 happened and the context requires that after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does indeed happen. Therefore E2 is true, ¬E2 is false.

Step 5 — conclude
- C1 (¬E2) is false.
- C2 (E2) is true.
- C3 (¬E2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (this only limits events after event2, doesn't prevent event2 itself).

Therefore, event2 does happen.

Step 2 — Translate the conditions
- C1: Event2 does not happen. → This is false (because event2 does happen).
- C2: C1 does not hold. → This is true (it asserts that C1 is false).
- C3: C2 does not hold. → This asserts that C2 is false; but C2 is true, so C3 is false.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A); it is true whenever interpreted as a standard implication.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology and therefore true.

Step 3 — trace the events (context)
- Initially event1 happened. Also, ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" so no further events (including event2) occur. This factual sequence does not contradict C1 or C2 (both are logical tautologies independent of other events).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 states: if C1 holds then C2 holds. Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication ""C1 → C2"" is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is p → p, a tautology; it holds in every situation (and certainly in the given context where event1 indeed happens).
- C2: identical to C1, so it is also a tautology and holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true (indeed they are the same tautology), the implication C1 → C2 is true.

Context about other events (no events after event1, etc.) does not conflict with these tautologies.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what is asked:

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""
C2: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""
They are the same formula (P → P). P → P is a tautology (always true), and in the given context event1 indeed happens initially, so both C1 and C2 hold.

Step 3 — conclude about C3:
Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication ""if C1 then C2"" is true. (More generally, C1 and C2 are identical tautologies, so C3 is necessarily true.)

- C3 is an implication with antecedent C2. Since C2 is false, the implication ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" is vacuously true.

Final answer:

---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context and C1–C2.

Step 2 — understand C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""  
- From the context, event1 did happen initially, so C1 is true (at least at the initial time).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Whether C2 is actually true or false isn’t needed for the final evaluation (see below), but it asserts C1 holds at all times.

Step 3 — what the context says about event2
- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen (following the initial event1). Also after event2 nothing else happens.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- If C2 is true (i.e., C1 always holds), then by the context event2 does happen (because event1 happened and event2 must follow). So the implication's consequent holds, making the implication true in this case.
- If C2 is false, the implication ""If C2 then event2"" is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

In both cases the implication is true. Therefore C3 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The hypothesis names:
  - C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
  - C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (F (F event1)).
  - C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" (F (F (F event1))).

- From the context: event1 has already happened initially. Under the standard interpretation of ""eventually"" (the temporal operator F, which is true if the proposition holds now or at some future time), C1 is true immediately because event1 holds at the initial moment.

- If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true — there exists a time (the current time) at which C1 holds. By the same reasoning, if C2 is true now then ""eventually C2"" (C3) is true now as well.

- More generally, nested F operators collapse: F p, F(F p), F(F(F p)), ... are all equivalent in this setting if p holds at some time (including now).

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true under the given scenario.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1 = ""event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time C1 is true).
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time C2 is true).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- Since event1 happens initially, C1 is already true at the initial time (event1 has happened).
- Because C1 holds immediately, there exists a time (the initial time) at which C1 is true, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
- Because C2 holds immediately, there exists a time (the initial time) at which C2 is true, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (event2 → event1)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (always(C1))
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (always(always(C1)))

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So from the initial point onward no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Also: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — which enforces event2 → event1 whenever event2 occurs.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 → event1. Given the context, event2 never occurs (because event1 happened and then no other events can happen), so C1 is vacuously true in all reachable states; it is also explicitly required by the context clause about event2.
- C2: always(C1). Since C1 holds at every time point (because event2 never occurs and the context enforces the implication), C2 holds.
- C3: always(always(C1)). The temporal ""always"" operator is idempotent (always(always φ) ≡ always φ), and since C2 holds at every time, C3 holds.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the statements:
- Context: (a) Initially event1 happened. (b) After event1, no other events can happen. (c) After event2, event1 must happen.
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Equivalent to (c).)
- C2: C1 always holds. (Globally: at all times, if event2 happens then event1 happens.)
- C3: C2 always holds. (Globally: at all times, C1 always holds.)

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences:
- event1 occurs initially, and after event1 no other events can occur. Therefore event2 can never occur at any time (there is no time before the initial event1).
- Because event2 never occurs, the implication ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" (C1) is vacuously true in every possible execution.
- Hence C1 holds at all times, so C2 (that C1 always holds) is true.
- Since C2 is true at all times and there is no way for it to become false, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The hypothesis asks whether C3 is true or false.

2. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur afterwards).
   - Also: after event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 happens, event1 must occur).

3. Examine C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the given rule ""after event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 holds.

4. Because event1 already happened initially and no other events can happen afterward, event2 cannot occur at any time. Therefore the implication ""if event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is vacuously true in every possible continuation—C1 always holds.

5. C2 states ""C1 always holds."" From (4), C2 is true.

6. C3 states ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true in the given scenario, C3 is also true.

Therefore C3 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once the initial event1 has occurred, no future event (including event2) can occur.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (given the second rule).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that after the initial event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means at some future point C1 will be true. But since C1 is false now and can never become true (event2 can never happen), C2 is also false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event1 has occurred, and after event1 no other events can happen. Thus once we start, no further events (including event2) can ever happen.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, event2 cannot happen at any future time, so C1 is false.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" In temporal logic, ""eventually C1"" is equivalent to ""C1"" when C1 itself is an eventuality (eventually eventually P = eventually P). More simply: C2 asserts that at some future point C1 will be true — but C1 is never true, so C2 is false.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future time it will become true that event2 eventually happens)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (negation of C2)

Step 2 — examine the context rules
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 has already happened initially, no further events can ever occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 can never occur (no events can occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — reason about the conditions
- Because no events can happen after the initial event1, event2 cannot ever happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- If C1 is false, then C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false.
- C3 is the statement that C2 does not hold; since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Brief, non-sensitive reasoning:
- From the context: event2 happened (so ""event2 happens"" is true), and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" gives the implication event1 → event2.
- C1 asserts event1 and event2. C2 asserts (if event1 then C1), which is equivalent to event1 → event2; this follows directly from the context, so C2 is true.
- C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both conjuncts are true, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events can occur after that initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 happens then event2 happens).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 did happen, but no events can happen after that initial event2, so event1 does not occur. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Written formally, this is p -> (p and q), which is logically equivalent to p -> q (if event1 then event2). That matches the context statement ""after event1, event2 must happen."" So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have C2 true (just above) and event2 true (initially). Therefore C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 is true.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
  - event2 does happen (initially). But event1 cannot occur at any time consistent with the context: it cannot occur after event2 because no events can occur after event2, and it cannot occur before the initial event2 because event2 happened initially. So event1 does not occur. Therefore C1 is false.

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., event1 → (event1 ∧ event2))
  - This is equivalent to requiring event1 → event2 (since event1 → event1 is automatic). The context already says ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" so whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur, satisfying C1 in that case. If event1 never occurs, the implication is vacuously true. Thus C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens.""
  - We have just established C2 is true, and the context gives event2 happened initially. Therefore C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Both C1 and C2 state the same thing: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes event2 terminal: once it has happened, no events occur afterward.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Since event2 already happened initially, by the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no event (including event2 again) can occur in the next state.

Step 4 — Evaluate C1, C2, and C3:
- C1 (event2 happens in the next state): False.
- C2 (same): False.
- C3 = C1 or C2: False or False = False.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" (Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens in the next state"".)

Step 2 — Understand the context:
- Initially (in the initial state) event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means in any state following a state where event2 has occurred, no events can occur in that subsequent state.
- (The ""after event1..."" clause is irrelevant because event1 did not occur initially.)

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Initial state S0: event2 occurred.
- Next state S1: because after event2 no other events can happen, S1 has no events occurring. Therefore event2 does not occur in S1.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- C1 is false, C2 is false, so C3 (C1 or C2) is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event2 happens in the next state.
- C3: C1 or C2 (so C3 is true iff event2 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — Understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 already occurred in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially and “after event2 no other events can happen,” there can be no events in the next state. In particular, event2 cannot also occur in the next state.

Step 4 — Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C2 is false (same as C1).
- Therefore C3 (C1 or C2) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts ""C1 holds and C2 holds"".
- C1 and C2 are the same claim: ""Event1 happens in the next state"".
- So C3 is true exactly when Event1 happens in the next state.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially (at the current/initial state) event1 has happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no events occur in any subsequent state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This is irrelevant unless event2 actually occurs; but because no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur later.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event1 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any events (including another occurrence of event1) in the next state.
- Therefore event1 does NOT happen in the next state.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, C2 is false, so C3 (C1 and C2) is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C1 holds and C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: identical to C1.
- So C3 is true iff event1 happens in the next state.

Step 3 — use the context to determine what can happen next
- Initially, event1 already happened (in the current/initial state).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events occur after that point (so nothing can happen in the next state).
- Therefore event1 does not (re)occur in the next state.

Step 4 — conclude
- C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state), so C2 is also false, hence C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the initial state).
- The statement ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means that once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in subsequent states. Therefore nothing (including event1 again) happens in the next state.
- C1 and C2 both assert ""Event1 happens in the next state""; given the context this is false.
- C3 is the conjunction of C1 and C2, so it is also false."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- We are asked whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

- Interpret the conditions in the natural way:
  - C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., event1 never occurs in the run).
  - C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" (there is some future point at which C1 is true).
  - C3: ""Eventually C2 holds"" (there is some future point at which C2 is true).

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Since event2 already happened initially, event1 is required to occur at some point in the run. Thus event1 does occur, so C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false.

- If C1 is false (event1 does happen), then C1 never becomes true, so C2 (""eventually C1"") is false. Consequently C3 (""eventually C2"") is also false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 asserts that ""C2 always holds.""

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event1 happens"" — which is just logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. ""It is always true that Event1 does not happen.""

Step 3 — trace the event sequence given the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later point.
- (The statement ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs here.)

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (Event1 happens) is false.
- C2 (Event1 does not happen) is true, and since event1 cannot ever happen after the initial event2, C2 holds at all times.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event1 does not happen"".
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = ""It is always the case that Event1 does not happen"".

- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 did not happen initially.)

Step 3 — trace the sequences and evaluate conditions
- Since event2 happens initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot happen at any time.
- Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- Because no further events can occur, C2 remains true at all times, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Final answer: True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 = ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is just ""Event1 happens.""
2. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event1 does not happen.""
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" = ""Always (Event1 does not happen)"" — i.e., in all (future) states, Event1 does not occur.
4. From the context: initially Event2 happened, and after Event2 no other events can happen. Therefore no event (including Event1) can happen now or in the future.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So once event1 has occurred, event2 will follow, then event1 again, and so on (an alternating chain).
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context rule ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Given the context rule is general, C1 does indeed always hold, so C2 is true.

Step 3 — Evaluate C3
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" We have C2 true. From the context, since initially event1 happened and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 does happen. Therefore the consequent of C3 is true in this situation.
- An implication with a true antecedent and a true consequent is true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 is the statement: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" We must determine whether C3 is true given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the system forces an alternating sequence starting from event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context rule ""after event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Given the context rule, C1 holds at all times, so C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" We have established C2 is true. Independently, from the context (initial event1 and the rule that after event1 event2 must happen), event2 does indeed happen (at least once, immediately after the initial event1). Therefore the implication ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" is true in this situation (antecedent true and consequent true).

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" The context explicitly says ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Given the context rule (after every event2, event1 must happen), C1 does hold at all times, so C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
C3 says: if C2 holds, then event2 happens. In our context C2 does hold, and independently the context also says ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Therefore event2 will occur. So the antecedent of C3 (C2) is true and the consequent (event2 happens) is also true, so the implication C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: Determine whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the event constraints.

2. Examine each condition:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology and holds in any state.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This requires there to be a next state; if there is one, C1 would indeed hold there (since C1 is a tautology).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires C2 to be true in every state along the execution.

3. Use the event constraints and trace:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).

4. Evaluate C2 at the initial (terminal) state: C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, but there is no next state, so C2 is false at the initial state (under standard semantics where X φ is false in a final state).

5. Since C2 is false at the initial state, C3 (""always C2"") is false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1) What C3 asks
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, C2 is true).

2) Examine C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p -> p), so C1 is true in any state.

3) Examine C2
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asserts that in the immediate successor state, C1 is true.
- Since C1 is true in every state, whenever a next state exists, C2 will be true at the current state. But C2 requires the existence of a next state.

4) Use the context / trace
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means the initial state is terminal: there is no next state after the initial state.
- At a terminal state the next-state assertion (C2) is not satisfied (the ""next"" is absent), so C2 is false at the initial (and only) state.

5) Conclusion for C3
- C3 requires C2 to hold at every state. Because C2 is false at the initial (terminal) state, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds.""
- C1 and C2 are each ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""

Step 2 — evaluate conditions against the context:
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- ""After Event1, no other events can happen"" implies no events occur after Event1; therefore Event2 does not happen later.
- Whether Event2 could have happened before Event1 is ruled out by ""initially Event1 happened"" (Event1 occurs at the initial point), so Event2 did not happen at any time.

Step 3 — truth of C1 and C2:
- C1 = (Event2 happens) or (Event1 happens). Since Event1 happened, C1 is true.
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.

Step 4 — truth of C3:
- C3 = C1 or C2. Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: Decide if C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is True or False.

1) What is being asked: C3 is true if at least one of C1 or C2 is true.

2) Understand each condition:
- C1: Event2 happens or Event1 happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or Event1 happens. (same as C1)
- Context facts:
  - Initially, Event1 happened.
  - After Event1, no other events can happen (so Event2 cannot happen after Event1).
  - After Event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant since Event2 did not occur).

3) Trace events:
- Event1 did occur (initially).
- Given Event1 occurred and it prevents any further events, Event2 did not occur.
- Therefore C1 evaluates to True because Event1 happened (Event2 false but disjunction satisfied). Same for C2.

4) Conclusion:
- At least one of C1 or C2 holds (in fact both hold), so C3 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — Interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur later.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" makes event2 terminal too, but that doesn't change the fact that event1 already happened initially.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 did happen, C1 is true.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C3
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 is true (and C2 is true), the disjunction C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (so the initial state is a state in which event2 has just occurred).
- “After event2, no other events can happen” and “After event1, no other events can happen” mean any state where event1 or event2 has happened is terminal (it has no successor states).

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” In the actual initial (terminal) state event1 did not happen, so C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” The initial state is terminal (no next state). Under the standard next-state semantics (X φ is false if there is no successor), C2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 is the implication “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.”
- An implication with a false antecedent is true. Since C2 is false in the given situation, the implication C3 is true (vacuously).

Conclusion: True.
---
Step 1 — Understand the setup:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal, but it does not occur initially).

Step 2 — Evaluate C1 and C2 in the initial state:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false, because event1 does not happen (event2 already happened and no further events can occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so the temporal ""next"" claim is false (in standard temporal semantics Xφ is false if there is no next state).

Step 3 — Evaluate C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens.""
- C3 is an implication. Its antecedent C2 is false in the initial state, so the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen. (So the initial state is terminal.)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" — this asserts event1 happens (in every relevant sense).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" — this asserts that in the next state, event1 always happens.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" — a conditional from C2 to event1 happening.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false: since initially event2 has happened and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not (and cannot) happen.
- C2 is false: there is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false (under standard next-state semantics).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is an implication ""if C2 then event1"". Because C2 is false (it never holds), the implication is true by standard (material) implication semantics — a conditional with a false antecedent is true. There is no state where C2 holds and would force event1, so C3 is vacuously true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" So C2 asserts that in the immediate successor state, event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C3 asserts that at every state along the run, C2 is true (i.e., in every state the next state satisfies C1).

Step 3 — use the context / trace possible executions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state C1 is true).
- The context also says: after event2, no other events can happen. That means the state where event2 has happened is terminal — there is no next state.
- (The clause about event1 is irrelevant because event1 does not occur in this execution.)

Step 4 — evaluate C2 and C3
- C2 requires a next state where C1 holds. But because the event2 state is terminal (no next state exists), ""C1 holds in the next state"" is not satisfied at the initial state (standard next-state semantics require a successor for X φ to be true).
- Therefore C2 is false at the initial state.
- Since C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is being asked: C3 is the claim ""C2 always holds"" (i.e. at every state along the execution). We must decide whether that claim is true given the context.

2. Understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen. (So the execution stops after that state.)
- After event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur).

3. Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just equivalent to ""event2 happens."" That is true at the initial state because event2 did happen.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (the run ends right after event2). Under the usual temporal semantics (the next operator requires an actual next state), ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false at the initial state because there is no next state in which C1 could hold.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" would require C2 to be true at every state. But C2 is false at the initial state (see previous point), so C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (event2 or event2 is the same).
- C1 is true initially because the context says ""Initially, event2 happened.""
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state — i.e. that event2 happens in the state immediately after the current one.
- But the context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" so no event (including event2) occurs in the next state. Therefore C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3 says C2 always holds; since C2 is false at least in the initial (and next) state, C3 is not true.

Thus C3 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event2 occurred (at the initial state).
- The context says that after event2 no other events can happen, so from that initial point onward no event1 can ever occur.
- There is no “before” initial where event1 could have happened, so event1 never happens in the whole execution — C1 is true.
- Since event1 never happens at any time, the proposition ""event1 does not happen"" holds at every state — C2 (always C1) is true.
- If C2 holds at every state, it in particular holds in the next state — C3 is true.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 has happened and the system state after that allows no further events. So event1 can never happen. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true in the initial (and only reachable) state.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also true because in every reachable state (there is only the initial one) C1 holds.
- C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). But there is no next state (no successor) after the initial state, so the ""next"" requirement cannot be satisfied. Under the standard semantics of the next operator (it is true only if a successor exists and satisfies the formula), C3 is false.

(If one used a nonstandard semantics that implicitly extends terminal states by stuttering successors, C3 could be true, but under the usual interpretation C3 is False.)
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true given the three context sentences about events.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context:
  1. Initially, event2 happened. So in the initial state event2 is true.
  2. After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, there are no further state transitions that produce other events.
  3. After event1, event2 must happen. So if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur later.

- Hypothesis components:
  - C1: Event1 does not happen (in the execution/run).
  - C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every state/event1 does not happen).
  - C3: C2 holds in the next state (i.e., in the immediate successor state C2 is true).

Step 3 — trace and reason through possible sequences
- The initial state already has event2. By (2) there can be no further events after that initial state (no successor states that introduce events).
- Because no further events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any later point. There is no place in the run for event1 to occur.
- Therefore C1 is true (event1 does not happen anywhere in the run).
- From that, C2 (""always C1"") is true: C1 holds in the initial and in every reachable state (there are no later states that would violate it).
- Regarding C3: asking whether C2 holds in the next state. There are two common semantic readings:
  - If ""next"" quantifies over all successors (universal), then since there are no successors after the initial state, the universal condition is vacuously true.
  - If ""next"" requires an actual successor to exist, there is no successor, but because C2 already holds globally and there are no states that could violate it, it is still satisfied in any (nonexistent) next state.
In either reading, nothing in the context allows a successor state that would falsify C2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and C1–C2.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — read as: C1 is true at all times (an invariant over the timeline).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e., it is not the case that C1 always holds.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence and truth of C1 over time
- At the initial moment, event2 happened, so C1 is true at that moment.
- After event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no further events occur. At times after the initial moment (e.g., after event1), ""event2 happens"" is no longer true (the occurrence of event2 was at the initial moment only).
- Therefore C1 is not true at all times; it holds at the initial moment but not always thereafter.

Step 4 — conclude about C2 and C3
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False given the event context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just the same as ""Event2 happens."" So C1 is true at the time(s) when event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" asserts that C1 is true at all times (i.e., event2 happens at every relevant time).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" asserts that it is not the case that C1 always holds.

Step 3 — trace the events
- The context says: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 does occur (once, initially), then event1 occurs, and then nothing else happens.

Step 4 — evaluate truth values
- C1 is true at the initial time (because event2 happened), but it does not hold at later times (event2 does not keep happening).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") therefore is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (i.e., that event2 occurs at the relevant moment).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — requires that C1 be true at all times (every relevant state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — asserts that it is not the case that C1 always holds.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 is true at the initial moment.
- After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. Thus there are later moments (after event1) where event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims
- C1 is true at the initial moment but is not true at all later moments (there are moments after event1 with no event2).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore true.

Identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs in the next state).
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, this is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is true and event1 did happen initially, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, and C2 also holds, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 states: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide if that statement is true or false given the definitions of C1 and C2 (and the context).

Step 2 — restate C1 and C2
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens. In logical form, C2 ≡ (C1 ∧ event1).

Step 3 — analyze C3 logically
- C3 is the implication (C2 → event1).
- Substituting C2, C3 is ((C1 ∧ event1) → event1).
- An implication of the form (A ∧ B) → B is a tautology: whenever A ∧ B is true, B is true (and if A ∧ B is false the implication is vacuously true).

Step 4 — role of the context
- The given event-sequence context (event1 then event2 etc.) does not affect the logical truth of the implication ((C1 ∧ event1) → event1).

Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the definitions.

- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is C1 ∧ event1.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" So C3 is (C1 ∧ event1) → event1.

From propositional logic, (A ∧ B) → B is a tautology: if the conjunction holds then its conjunct B holds. Thus C3 is logically true. The background about events (initial event1, event2 must follow, etc.) is irrelevant to this logical implication.

True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
C3 states: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether that conditional is true given the definitions of C1 and C2 (and the context).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (Not entailed by the context—context only says event1 happened initially.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is the conjunction (C1 ∧ event1).

Step 3 — logical relationship
C2 explicitly includes ""event1 happens"" as part of the conjunction. Logically, (C1 ∧ event1) → event1 is a tautology: if a conjunction holds then each conjunct holds.

Conclusion
C3 is therefore true (it follows directly from the structure of C2).

Sample responses:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false.

2. C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" and C2 is the same. Each simplifies to the single proposition P = ""Event1 happens"" (P or P ≡ P). So C1 and C2 are identical.

3. C3 is therefore P → P. In propositional logic, any formula of the form P → P is a tautology (always true): it is true whether P is true or false.

4. The context also makes P true (event1 happened initially), so C1 and C2 hold, and the implication certainly holds.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must evaluate C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — understand C1 and C2
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also ""Event1 happens.""

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate C1 and C2
- Context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""Event1 happens"" is true in the given context.
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is ""If C1 then C2."" With C1 true and C2 true, the implication is true (true implies true).

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same atom).
- C2 is ""Event1 happens"" (same).
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"", i.e. ""If Event1 happens then Event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So ""Event1 happens"" is true at the initial point.)
- The other context sentences (""After event2, event1 must happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen"") do not contradict the fact that event1 happened; they are irrelevant to the truth of C3 here.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C3 is a tautological implication (P → P), which is true whenever P is true — and the context gives P true (event1 happened). Even if P were false, P → P would still be true; in either case the implication holds.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 asserts: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So we must decide whether the formula X(C2) is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially event2 happened, so in the initial state C1 := (event1 or event2) is true (because event2 happened).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means the state reached after event2 is terminal: there is no further state with any events occurring.
- We read ""happens"" as an instantaneous fact true only in the state where the event occurs; ""always"" (globally) means true in every current and future state; ""next"" (X) requires the existence of a next state and asks whether the property holds there.

Step 3 — reason about C2 and C3
- C2 = ""C1 always holds."" In the current (initial) state C1 is true. Since there are no future states after the terminal state reached by event2, C1 holds in all states of the trace (the single state), so C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state (the state after event2 is terminal), so X(C2) is false (the next-state assertion fails when no next state exists).

Conclusion
- C3 is False.
---
Let's go step by step.

1. Interpret the context:
   - Initially, event2 happens.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so the run ends at the initial state).
   - (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event1 did not occur initially.)

2. Evaluate C1 at the initial state:
   - C1 = ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event2 happens initially, C1 is true at the initial state.

3. Evaluate C2 at the initial state:
   - C2 = ""C1 always holds."" The system has no future states after the initial state (because after event2 no events can happen), so along the trace C1 is true in every state (there is only the initial state). Hence C2 is true at the initial state.

4. Evaluate C3:
   - C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (the run ends after the initial state). Under the usual interpretation of ""in the next state"" (which requires an actual successor state), a property requiring the next state cannot be satisfied when no next state exists. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initial state S0: event2 happened, so C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") is true at S0.
- The context says that after event2 no other events can happen, so there is a following state S1 in which no events occur. At S1 neither event1 nor event2 happens, so C1 is false at S1.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") asserts C1 at every state. Because C1 is false at S1, C2 is false.
- C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state (i.e., C2 is true at S1). But we just saw C2 is false at S1.

Therefore C3 is False. (If there were no next state at all, the ""next"" claim would also fail.)"

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

- Examine each condition:
  - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (vacuously true) in any state.
  - C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is tautologically true, C2 holds in every state (including the initial one).
  - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This requires there to be a next state in which C2 is true.

- Trace the event sequence from the context:
  - Initially event1 happened.
  - After event1, no other events can happen — so there is no successor/next state after the initial state.
  - (Event2 never occurs in any reachable state, so C1 remains vacuously true everywhere.)

- Because there is no next state, the statement ""C2 holds in the next state"" is not satisfied under the usual semantics of the next operator (which is false when no next state exists). Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterwards).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs after the initial event1).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in any state whether event2 holds or not.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true globally (in every state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Given C2 holds in every state, it in particular holds in the next state (assuming a next state exists — if the model allows a next state with no events, C1 still holds there).

Conclusion
- C3 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C3 is the statement ""C2 holds in the next state.""
- C2 is ""C1 always holds.""
- C1 is ""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. event2 → event2).

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1 (event2 → event2) is a tautology: it is true in every state.
- Therefore C2 (""always C1"", i.e. globally C1) is true in every state as well.

Step 3 — trace the timeline from the context:
- Initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal: there is no next state.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 requires that C2 hold in the next state. But there is no next state. Under the usual temporal semantics (the ""next"" operator requires a successor state), ""next φ"" is false in a terminal state.
- Therefore C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just event2 (a tautology collapse).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event2 holds in the immediate successor state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 must be true in every state (including the initial state).

Step 2 — Use the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen — there is no successor state after the initial state.

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1 is true in the initial state (event2 is true).
- C2 requires a next state where C1 holds. But there is no next state, so C2 is false in the initial state (under the standard semantics where ""next"" is false when no successor exists).
- Since C2 is false at the initial state, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- Initially event2 did happen, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event2 holds in the immediate successor state. But the context says ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" so there is no next state after the initial state. With standard next-state semantics, ""next φ"" is not satisfied when no successor exists, so C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3 requires C2 to hold in every state; since C2 is already false in the initial state, C3 is false.

- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C3 says C2 holds in every state (always).

Step 3 — trace the events
- Initially event2 happened.
- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. That means the state reached after the initial event2 has no successor state (no next state).

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 is true in the initial state (event2 did happen).
- C2 requires that C1 hold in the next state. But there is no next state after the initial state (because after event2 nothing else can happen), so C2 is false in the initial state under the standard interpretation that ""next"" requires a successor state.
- Since C2 is false in the initial state, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs after event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs after event2).
- Thus the system ensures both event1 and event2 occur (indeed repeatedly, starting with event1).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 states C1 ⇒ C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C1 ⇒ C2 is logically true (a proposition implies itself), and here both are true in the context.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C1 and C2 are identical statements.

Step 3 — use the context to see if C1/C2 hold
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Therefore both events do happen (at least event1 then event2, and the pattern continues). So C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is ""If C1 then C2"". Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is a tautology (P → P), and with C1 true and C2 true the implication holds.

Final answer:
True

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- From the context, C1 is true (both events happen).
- C2 is the same statement, so it is also true.
- More generally, ""If P then P"" is always true for any proposition P (a tautology).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Let t0 be the initial moment when event2 happened.
2. The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. So at the next moment t1 there are no events occurring.
3. C1 says “event2 always happens.” For C1 to be true it must hold at t1 as well; but at t1 no event2 happens, so C1 is false.
4. C2 is “C1 holds or event2 happens.” At t1, neither C1 nor event2 holds, so C2 is false at t1.
5. C3 asserts “C2 always holds.” Because we found a moment (t1) where C2 is false, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The context forces the following: event2 happens in the initial state, and once event2 has happened no further events can occur. So every allowed execution has event2 at the start and then terminates (no later states with other events).

2. C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Even if C1 (event2 always happens) is false, C2 is true in the initial state because event2 happens there.

3. Because no further states exist after that initial state (no events can happen after event2), there are no future states where C2 could fail. Thus C2 holds in every state of every allowed execution.

4. Therefore ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is true.
---
Step 1 — read the context
- At the initial moment event2 happened (so event2 is true at time t0).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing happens at any t>t0).
- The rule “after event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant because event1 can never occur (event1 would have to occur after t0 but no events can occur after t0).

Step 2 — examine C1 (""Event2 always happens"")
- “Always happens” means event2 must hold at every time instant. We only know event2 holds at t0; there is no information that event2 holds at later times. In fact, because no events occur after t0, event2 need not hold at those later times. So C1 is not guaranteed (it can be false).

Step 3 — examine C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"")
- At t0 this disjunction is true because event2 happens at t0. But at later times (t>t0) event2 does not happen, and C1 need not hold, so C2 can be false at those times.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 (""C2 always holds"")
- For C3 to be true, C2 must hold at every time. Because we can have times after t0 where neither C1 holds nor event2 happens, C2 can fail there. Therefore C3 is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C3 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" We must decide if that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true (it occurred).
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 is true, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Logically, p → (p ∨ q) is always true; and here, even directly, because C1 is already true, the implication holds. Thus C2 is true.

Step 3 — trace sequences / consistency with temporal facts:
- The context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" which prevents event2 from happening later, but that doesn't invalidate any of the above facts. Event1 already happened initially, and C2 is satisfied regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Event1 is true and C2 is true, so their conjunction C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
First identify what’s being asked:
- C3 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Examine the context and each condition:
1. Context facts:
   - Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. Thus no event can occur after that initial event1 (in particular, event2 cannot occur later).
   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" only constrains sequences where event2 occurs; it does not force event2 to occur.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
   - Since event1 already happened, C1 is true.

3. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""
   - This implication is true in all cases:
     - If event2 does not happen, the implication is vacuously true.
     - If event2 does happen, C1 would be true because ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" is true whenever event2 happens.
   - So C2 holds.

4. C3 = ""event1 happens and C2 holds.""
   - We have established event1 happens (from the context) and C2 holds. Therefore C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C3 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"". We must decide if that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has happened, no further events occur.)

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 happens (from the context), C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Because C1 is true regardless (due to event1), the implication in C2 is true whether or not event2 actually occurs. (There is no possible case consistent with the context where event2 happens and C1 is false.)

Step 4 — combine for C3:
- We have ""event1 happens"" true, and we have shown C2 holds. Therefore C3 (their conjunction) is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 (and after event1) no further events can occur.
- C1 is the proposition ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 has already happened initially, C1 is true at the initial moment.
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" In standard temporal semantics ""eventually"" includes the current moment (there exists a time ≥ now where the proposition holds). Because C1 holds now, C2 is true.
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" For the same reason, C2 already holds now, so C3 is true. (More generally, eventually(eventually p) is equivalent to eventually p.)

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"", i.e. eventually(C2)) is True or False given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Hypotheses:
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. eventually(C1)).
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e. eventually(C2)).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true at the initial moment.
- ""Eventually"" (◇) is standardly interpreted as ""at some time ≥ now"" (it may be satisfied by the current moment). Because C1 is already true now, eventually(C1) is true. Thus C2 is true now.
- By the same reasoning, eventually(C2) is true (C2 holds now), so C3 is true. Note also that ◇◇φ is equivalent to ◇φ, so nesting doesn't change truth.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the facts
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2 (and likewise after event1) no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true at the initial moment.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Because C1 is already true now, C2 is true (the “eventually” operator is satisfied by the current moment).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is true now, C3 is also true (again, “eventually” is satisfied immediately).

Conclusion
- True

(If one used a nonstandard semantics where ""eventually"" requires a strictly later time and cannot be satisfied by the current moment, then C2 and C3 would be false because no further events can occur. Under the usual semantics where ""eventually"" allows the present, C3 is True.)"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happens; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So event2 and event1 both occur (in a repeating sequence).
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" — given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""event2 happens and C1 holds"" — since C1 is true and event2 happens, C2 is true (and in fact C2 is logically equivalent to C1).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — this is the implication C2 → event2.

Step 3 — reasoning about C3
- C2 explicitly contains ""event2 happens"" as a conjunct. Therefore whenever C2 is true, event2 is true. So C2 → event2 is logically valid.
- In the given context C2 is true and event2 is true, so the implication holds. Even vacuously, if C2 were false the implication would still be true; but here it's true non-vacuously.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the statements.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (so C1 asserts event2 and event1)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (so C2 explicitly asserts event2 and also that C1 is true)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" (an implication from C2 to event2)

Step 3 — logical tracing
- C2 explicitly includes ""Event2 happens"" as part of its conjunction. Any statement that asserts ""A and B"" implies A.
- Therefore, from C2 it follows immediately that event2 happens. The temporal context (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...) is consistent with this, but not needed: C2 already contains event2.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
You ask whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context: event2 happens initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So both event2 and event1 occur (possibly repeatedly).  
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This follows from the context, so C1 is true.  
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 already asserts event2 happens and event1 happens, C2 is true (it’s just event2 ∧ C1).  

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is the implication (C2 → event2). But C2 is a conjunction whose first conjunct is ""event2 happens."" So whenever C2 holds, event2 is already true by definition. Therefore the implication C2 → event2 is logically valid.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""  
- C2: ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""  
  (C1 and C2 are the same proposition.)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" i.e. C1 → C2.

Step 3 — Use the context about events
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen. After Event1, Event2 must happen. So Event2 and Event1 both occur (in fact they alternate indefinitely).
- Therefore the proposition ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens"" is true in the scenario, so C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C3
- Because C1 and C2 are identical propositions, the implication C1 → C2 is a tautology (P → P is always true). In this scenario C1 is true and C2 is true, so the implication certainly holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: Event1 happens or event2 happens. (A ∨ B)
- C2: Event1 happens or event2 happens. (A ∨ B)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. That is (A ∨ B) → (A ∨ B).

Note C1 and C2 are the same formula.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context (""Initially, event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen"") implies at least one of event1 or event2 happens (indeed event2 already happened), so C1 is true and C2 is true as well.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- Since C1 and C2 are identical, the implication (C1 → C2) is a tautology (true in all cases). Given the context both C1 and C2 hold anyway, so C3 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the question:

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
  They are the same statement.
- From the context: initially event2 happened, so ""event2 happens"" is true; therefore both C1 and C2 are true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is the implication C1 → C2. Since C1 and C2 are identical, the implication is a tautology (A → A) and is true. Also, in this specific case true → true is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — settle the temporal meanings (standard reading)
- ""always"" = globally (holds at every time/state).
- ""eventually"" = at some future time.
- Events are occurrences at points in time (not persistent true states unless explicitly stated).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means G(event1) — event1 is true at every state. From the context, initially event2 happened, so at the initial state event1 is not true. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means G(C1). But since C1 is already false at the start, C2 is also false at the start. (In LTL G(G(event1)) is equivalent to G(event1), so C2 is equivalent to C1 and is false.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means there exists a future state where C2 is true (some time from which C1 holds at all times). For C2 to become true at some point, from that point onward event1 would need to be true at every state. But the context says event1 occurs after event2 and after event1 no other events can happen — that describes a single occurrence of event1 and then termination, not that event1 is true at all subsequent states. Therefore there is no future point from which event1 is globally true, so C2 never becomes true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says “C2 eventually holds.” We must decide whether that is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Since C1 is true in every state, it certainly holds in the next state, so C2 is true now.
- The context (initially event1; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen) guarantees a next state exists and events alternate, but that’s not even needed because C1 is globally true.

Step 3 — conclude about C3
Because C2 already holds (indeed it holds immediately), “eventually C2” is satisfied. Even under stricter readings of “eventually” that require a future step, the alternating behavior ensures C2 holds at the next state anyway.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event2 -> event2).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state.
- C3: C2 eventually holds.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1 is a tautology (A -> A). It is true in any state where truth-values are defined.
- Therefore, in any state the next-state formula ""C1 holds in the next state"" (C2) is true whenever a next state exists, because C1 will be true in that next state.
- Since in the given system there is an infinite alternating sequence (initially event1, then event2, then event1, ...), every state has a next state, and C2 holds in every state.
- If C2 holds in every state, then ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is true (it already holds now).

Conclusion: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (formally: event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (next C1)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (F next C1)
We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1 is a tautology: p → p is always true, so C1 holds in every state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is true in every state, C1 is true in every next state as well; therefore C2 is true in every state that has a next state.
- The context forces an alternation of events (initially event1, after event1 event2, after event2 event1, ...), so every state with an event1 or event2 has a next state according to the given rules (producing an infinite sequence of states).

Step 3 — trace and conclude
- Because C1 holds everywhere, C2 holds at every state that has a next state (in particular it holds from the start in the given alternating sequence).
- Thus ""eventually C2"" is satisfied (indeed C2 holds immediately), so C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the propositions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ ""Event2 does not eventually happen.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ ""Eventually (event2 does not eventually happen).""

Given the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

From that, no further events can ever occur (event2 cannot occur). Therefore:
- C1 is false (event2 does not eventually happen).
- C2 is true (C1 does not hold).
- C2 is already true at the initial moment, so C2 holds now and hence ""eventually C2 holds"" is true.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 does not eventually happen).
- C3: C2 eventually holds (i.e., at some time C1 is false).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no subsequent events can ever occur.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (any occurrence of event2 would have to be after the initial event1, which is forbidden).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Event2 can never occur, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true right now (and will remain true).
- C3 asserts that C2 will hold at some time; because C2 already holds (and persists), C3 is satisfied.

Final answer:
True

You ask whether C3 is true or false.

1) What the hypothesis asks
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" So we must decide whether the proposition C2 becomes true at some point (including now).

2) Examine each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no events can happen now or in the future.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (no events can occur after the initial event1).

3) Evaluate the claims
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is false because no events can occur after the initial event1.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (and true already at the initial moment).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some time (immediately), so C3 is true.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C3 is the claim “If C1 holds, then C2 holds” (i.e., C1 → C2).

Step 2 — examine each condition:
C1: “Event1 eventually happens.”
C2: “Event1 eventually happens.”
They are the same statement.

Step 3 — trace the context:
The context says event2 happened initially and then event1 must happen, so event1 does indeed eventually happen. Thus both C1 and C2 are true in the given scenario. Independently, any statement implies itself (P → P is always true).

Conclusion:
True

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether this implication is true given the context.

- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C1 and C2 are the same statement.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate C1 and C2
- Initially event2 happened.
- The context states: after event2, event1 must happen — so event1 does eventually happen.
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication ""If C1 then C2"" is true.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no possible next state after the initial state (event2 is terminal), and in any case C1 is false, so C2 is false.

- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once the initial event2 occurs, the trace ends there and event1 cannot occur anywhere (neither now nor later).
- Also: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false, because event1 does not occur in the initial (and terminal) state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (and even if there were, C1 is false globally), so C2 is false.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event2 happened, and ""after event2 no other events can happen"" — so from the initial state no event1 can occur now or later.
2. Hence C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false (there is at least the initial state where event1 does not happen).
3. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false: either there is no next state (so X C1 is false) or, if a next state exists, event1 still does not hold there.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 states: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 is true.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is also true.

Step 3 — trace event context (consistency check)
- The context says event2 happened initially, so the antecedent of C1/C2 is true and the consequent is true; that reinforces that both C1 and C2 hold. The other context rules do not conflict with these tautological implications.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" is true (true → true is true). Also C1 and C2 are logically equivalent, so C1 → C2 is valid.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the form p → p, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- C2: identical to C1, likewise a tautology (always true).

Step 3 — trace with the context (for completeness):
- The context states event2 happened initially, so the antecedent of C1/C2 is actually true in the scenario; but this is unnecessary because p → p is true in all cases.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- Since C1 is true and C2 is true (in fact they are the same tautology), the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" is true.
- More generally, (p → p) → (p → p) is also a tautology.

- C2: same as C1, likewise true.
- The context (event2 happened initially, etc.) also implies event2 occurs, which makes both C1 and C2 true in the scenario, but they are already logically true regardless.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, event1 must happen.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires C2 to be true at every time point, not just initially.

- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no further events (including further occurrences of event1) can occur after that initial moment.
- C2 requires ""event1 happens"" to be true at the time of evaluation. C2 is true at the initial time but is not true at later times (there are no event occurrences later).
- Therefore C2 does not hold at all times, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology and so holds.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 holds exactly at those times when event1 happens.
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So C2 is true at the initial moment. ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That prevents any further events but does not make the occurrence ""event1 happens"" true at all later times (events are occurrences at times). ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur once event1 has occurred.

Trace: C2 is true at the initial time (because event1 happened and C1 holds), but at later times event1 does not ""happen"" (no new events occur), so C2 does not hold at those times.

Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False. Final answer: False
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the context:
   - Initially, event1 happened. So in the initial (and reachable) state we have the fact ""event1 happened.""
   - After event1, no other events can happen. That makes the state reached after event1 terminal: nothing can change afterwards.
   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened and prevents any further events).

2. Examine the conditions:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (always true).
   - C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since event1 happened initially and C1 is true, C2 is true in the initial state.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because no events can occur after event1, nothing can change the truth of the facts. The fact ""event1 happened"" and the tautology C1 continue to hold in every reachable state, so C2 holds in all states.

3. Conclusion:
   - C3 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Both C1 and C2 are ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Therefore no event after event1 can occur, including event2.)
- The clause ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur given the previous line.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence and evaluate C1/C2:
- Since event1 happened initially and it prevents any further events, event2 does not happen. So C1 is true. C2 is identical, so C2 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is ""C1 or C2."" At least one (in fact both) of C1/C2 is true, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts ""C1 holds or C2 holds,"" where C1 and C2 are each ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the premises:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This last fact is irrelevant once we know event1 occurred.)

Step 3 — reason about event sequences:
- Since event1 already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""Event2 does not happen"") is also true (same statement).
- Therefore C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event2 does not happen. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds (i.e., ""Event2 does not happen"" OR ""Event2 does not happen"").

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" → event2 would also be terminal if it occurred, but that is irrelevant if it never occurs.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event1 happened initially and it prevents any subsequent events, event2 cannot happen after that point. There is no indication event2 happened before the initial event1, and the natural reading is that event1 happened at the start, so event2 does not occur at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 is true (event2 does not happen).
- C2 is the same and therefore true.
- C3 is the disjunction of two true statements, so C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (at the start).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 requires a later event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — once it has occurred, no further events can occur).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just “event2 happens” (redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., event2 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., at all times, event2 does not happen (event2 never occurs).

Step 4 — reason about possible sequences
Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no event (including event2) can occur at any later time. Could event2 have happened before the initial event1? No — event1 happened initially, so there is no earlier time when event2 could have occurred. Therefore event2 never happens.

Step 5 — conclude
C1 is false, so C2 is true. Since event2 never happens at any time, C2 holds at all times, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" So the question is whether, given the context, C2 is true at all times.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This just reduces to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 means ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" So C3 claims ""Event2 never happens (at any time).""

Step 3 — use the context to trace possible event sequences
- Initially, event1 happened.
- The context also says: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has happened (and it has happened initially), no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1 (""event2 happens"") is false.
- C2 (""event2 does not happen"") is true, and because event2 is impossible after the initial event1, C2 remains true at all times.
- Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction is just the same literal twice).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = ""Event2 never happens (at any time).""

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once the initial event1 has occurred, no event2 can ever occur later.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time in the timeline.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 is true (event2 does not happen).
- C2 holds at all times (there are no possible later events to make it false), so C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Answer being asked: is C3 true or false?

Step-by-step:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — thus C2 is false (because C1 is true).
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of a false statement, so C3 is true.

No other context constraint contradicts this (the rules about events only restrict other events after event1; they don't make C1 false).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
You ask whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen.
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen.
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does not happen).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., C2 is false).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- The context explicitly states event1 happened initially, so C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the three conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — just means event1 happens (redundant).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. event1 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. it is not the case that event1 does not happen, so equivalently event1 does happen. (C3 is logically equivalent to C1.)

Step 3 — use the context
- The context states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen.
- The other context constraints (""after event1 no other events can happen"" and ""after event2 event1 must happen"") do not contradict the fact that event1 happened.

Step 4 — conclude
- Since event1 happened, C1 is true, so C2 is false, and C3 (not C2) is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked:
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen (at least initially).
- (The rules ""after event1 event2 must happen"" and ""after event2 event1 must happen"" only reinforce that event2 occurs; they don't make event2 false.)

Step 3 — Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is False.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is False, the implication is vacuously true — C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have C2 = True and event2 happens = True, so C3 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (the conjunction ""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition with the context
- Context: event2 happened initially. Also rules: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" In classical logic a conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- The second conjunct of C3, ""event2 happens"", is true (given by the context).

Step 3 — combine
- C2 is true and event2 happens is true, so C3 (C2 ∧ event2) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify what's asked
You ask whether C3 (the conjunction ""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: Initially, event2 happened. Also there are rules: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. The important factual point: event2 did happen (at least initially).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is false (because event2 did happen).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a material implication. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have C2 true (from above) and event2 does happen (given by the context), so the conjunction is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterward (and since event1 is initial, there is no time for event2 to occur).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 happened, C1 is true.
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" At least one of C1 or C2 is true (in fact both), so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C3 is true given the context. C3 is defined as (C1 holds) or (C2 holds). C1 and C2 are both ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur after that.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" only matters if event2 occurs; but given the first two facts, event2 cannot occur (it cannot occur after event1, and it cannot have occurred before the initial event1 without violating the ""after event2, event1 must happen"" requirement), so event2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- C1 = (event2 or event1) = (False or True) = True.
- C2 = same = True.
- C3 = (C1 or C2) = (True or True) = True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: E2 or E1.
- C2: E2 or E1.
- C3: C1 or C2, so C3 ≡ (E2 or E1) or (E2 or E1) ≡ (E2 or E1). In other words, C3 is true iff E1 or E2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened → E1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only restricts events after that moment; it does not make E1 false.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" imposes that if E2 occurs then E1 must also occur afterward, but we already have E1 true initially.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since E1 is true (it happened initially), the disjunction E2 or E1 is true regardless of E2.
- Therefore C1 is true, C2 is true, and thus C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the statement “C2 always holds” (i.e., at every point in time, C2 is true). We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context facts:
  - Initially event1 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 would be followed by event1).
  - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event1 happens.” This is the tautological formula p → p (where p is “event1 happens”), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Since C1 is true already in every state, “eventually C1” is satisfied immediately (and therefore at any state).
- C3: “C2 always holds.” This requires that at every state, C2 is true. Because C2 is true at every state (C1 is always true), C3 holds.

Step 3 — trace/consistency check with the context
- The context’s constraints (event1 happens initially and is terminal) do not invalidate C1 or C2: C1 is a tautology and remains true even if no further events occur. Thus C2 holds at all times, and so C3 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
You are asked whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the two preceding conditions C1 and C2.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in any state (whether event1 occurs there or not).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds right now (indeed everywhere), the eventuality is satisfied immediately; C2 is true at every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is true at every state, C3 is true.

Step 3 — Check consistency with the context
The context (event1 happened initially; after event1 no events can happen) does not contradict any of the above: C1 is tautologically true, so C2 and hence C3 hold.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context:
  - Initially event1 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication with the same antecedent and consequent) — it is true in any state where the formula is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true whenever evaluated, there is certainly some (in fact every) time at which C1 holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires that at every time point from now on, C2 is true.

Step 3 — trace event sequences and evaluate
- Initially event1 has happened. Because after event1 no other events can happen, no future event2 can occur; the system is in a state where event1 has occurred and no new events occur thereafter.
- C1 is true in the initial state (and, being a tautology, in any state).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true in the initial state and in every subsequent state.
- Hence C2 holds at all times — C3 is true.

- Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition and that proposition is true in the context, the implication ""if C1 then C2"" holds.
- More generally, P → P is always true (tautology).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must determine whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the statement that event2 happens (repeated).
- C2: same as C1.

Step 3 — use the context:
- Context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen.
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is ""If C1 then C2."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: same as C1, also equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""

Step 3 — use the context:
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 did happen. (The additional statements about no other events happening don't contradict this.)

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C1 is true (event2 happened).
- C2 is true (same fact).
- An implication ""If C1 then C2"" with true antecedent and true consequent is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is simply ""event1 happens"" (since ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" is the same).
- C2 is ""always C1"", i.e. at every time point event1 happens.
- C3 is ""eventually C2"", i.e. there is some time from which onward event1 happens at every time point.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened (event1 occurs at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there are no further occurrences of any events after that initial event).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs (no events after event1).

Step 3 — reason about C2 and C3
- C2 (""always event1"") would require event1 to occur at every time point. Only the initial moment has event1; later times have no events, so event1 does not occur at those times. Thus C2 is false at every time.
- C3 (""eventually C2"") would require that at some time we reach a point from which event1 holds at all future times. Since C2 never becomes true, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is just the (redundant) statement “Event1 happens” (same disjunct twice).
- C2 says “C1 always holds.”
- C3 says “C2 eventually holds.”

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened, so C1 is true at the start.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so the fact “event1 has happened” cannot be undone; it remains true at all future times.
- Therefore C2 (that C1 always holds) is true from the start.
- If C2 holds always, then C2 certainly holds at some time (indeed immediately), so C3 (“C2 eventually holds”) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the statement ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the future C2 will be true). We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just ""Event1 happens"" (a tautological repetition).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means ""Event1 happens"" holds at all times.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means ""at some time in the future, 'Event1 happens' will hold at all times from then on"" (or simply that C2 becomes true at some time).

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially, event1 happened, so C1 is true at the initial moment.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred the system remains in that situation (no further events), so the fact ""event1 happened"" persists from the initial moment onward.
- Therefore C1 holds at every time point (it holds initially and continues to hold), so C2 is already true.
- If C2 is already true, then it certainly ""eventually holds"" (it holds now), so C3 is true.

True

Brief justification: C1 and C2 assert the same proposition (""Event2 does not happen""), so C3 is P -> P, which is always true under standard material implication (even if P is false in the given scenario).
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine each condition using the context:
- Context: event1 happened; after event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C2 is also false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is ""If C1 then C2"" i.e. ""If (event2 does not happen) then (event2 does not happen)."" This implication is true because the antecedent is false (an implication with a false antecedent is true), and also because the antecedent and consequent are identical.

Final answer:
True

First: the hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- Context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen. So C1 is false and C2 is false.

Reasoning about C3:
- C3 is the implication C1 -> C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C1 -> C2 is a tautology (P -> P) and is always true. Also, in this situation the antecedent C1 is false, and an implication with a false antecedent is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked:
- C3 says ""C2 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.""
  - Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no events at all can occur after the start; in particular event2 cannot occur at any time.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is true (event2 is impossible).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial moment (and forever after), C2 is true (it holds immediately, hence eventually).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" We must check that at every time point along the execution, C2 holds. Because from the initial state onward C1 is true, at every time point it is still true that eventually C1 holds (indeed it already holds). Therefore C2 holds at every time, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is asked:
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Thus once event1 has occurred, no future event occurs, including event2.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Redundant here, since event2 never gets the chance once event1 has occurred.)

Step 3 — Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Since event1 has already happened and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds at the initial time, so there is (indeed) a time at which C1 holds; therefore C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C1 holds at all times (event2 never happens), C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at every time point. Thus C2 holds always, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — understand the setup
- Initially event1 has happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no events can happen at any later time.
- (Separately) ""After event2, no other events can happen."" This is irrelevant because event2 cannot happen given the previous point.

Step 2 — examine C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given that event1 occurred initially and that prevents any further events, event2 can never occur. So C1 is true (holds now and at every time).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately, C2 is true (eventually includes the present).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because the situation never changes (no further events), C1 remains true at all times, hence C2 remains true at all times. Therefore C3 is true.

True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (i.e. if Event2 happens next, then Event2 happens next)

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the very next state after the initial state is event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 would occur after that).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Given the rules, the next state after the initial event2 is event1, not event2. So C1 is false. C2 is the same claim, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 (""If C1 then C2""):
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C1 is false, the implication ""if C1 then C2"" is true regardless of C2's truth value.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
They are the same proposition.

Step 3 — trace the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rules say: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- So immediately after the initial event2, the next state must have event1 (not event2). Therefore C1 is false in the next state, and so is C2.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- Because C1 and C2 are the same proposition, the implication ""if C1 then C2"" is logically valid (P → P is always true). Also, in this model both C1 and C2 are false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (i.e. C1 → C2)

Step 2 — examine the background/context:
- Initially event2 happened (call that state s0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state s1, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so s2 has event2), and so on alternating.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Relative to the initial state s0, the next state s1 has event1, not event2. So C1 is false in s0. C2 is the same statement as C1, so C2 is also false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 (C1 → C2):
- An implication P → Q is true whenever P is false (and is also true when P and Q are both true). Here P and Q are identical (C1 and C2), so P → P is a tautology. Concretely, since C1 is false, C1 → C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has occurred, there is no successor state with further events.
- After event2, event1 must happen — not needed for the core conclusion here.

Step 3 — evaluate the formulas
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (always true) in any state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is true in any state where C1 is evaluated.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This requires there to be a next state after the current one in which C2 is true.

Step 4 — apply the context to C3
Because initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, there is no next state after the initial state. With no next state to evaluate, the statement ""C2 holds in the next state"" is not satisfied.

Final answer
False
---
Answer: False.

Reasoning (step by step):
- C1 is the tautology ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"", so C1 is true in any state.
- Therefore C2 = ""event2 happens or C1"" is true in any state (since C1 is true).
- C3 asserts ""C2 holds in the next state"" (the next-state operator X C2).
- From the context: initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen — the initial state is a terminal state with no successor. Under the usual semantics for the next operator (X φ is false at a state that has no successor), X C2 is false at the initial state because there is no next state.
- Hence C3 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start state S0: event1 has happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means S0 has no successor (no next state).
- C1 (""if event2 happens then event2 happens"") is a tautology, so C1 is true at S0.
- C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds"") is therefore true at S0 (because C1 holds).
- C3 asserts ""C2 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state after S0, so the next-state proposition fails (the next-state operator requires an actual successor to evaluate).
Therefore C3 is False."

- C2 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C3 = C1 OR C2 (so C3 is equivalent to the same disjunction).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" That makes ""event1 happens"" true.
- The other rules (""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"") impose future relationships but do not negate that event1 already happened.

- Since ""event1 happens"" is true, C1 is true and C2 is true.
- Therefore C3 = C1 OR C2 is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. So if event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. So if event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 (and C2) is true, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked:
C3 is the statement ""(C1 holds) or (C2 holds)"". We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 implies a later event1).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 implies a later event2).
- Hypothesis parts: C1 = (event2 happens) or (event1 happens). C2 is identical to C1. C3 = C1 or C2.

Step 3 — trace the events:
- Initially event1 has already happened, so ""event1 happens"" is true.
- From Rule B, that initial event1 requires that event2 happens afterward, so event2 will happen as well; then by Rule A event1 will happen again, and so on. But already we have at least one true occurrence of event1.

Step 4 — conclude:
Since event1 happens, C1 is true (and so is C2). Therefore C3 = C1 or C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" is ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 ∨ event2).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state, (event1 ∨ event2) should hold.

2. Use the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Also after event1, no other events can happen. Both events are terminal: once event2 has happened, no further occurrences of event1 or event2 occur in later states.

3. Evaluate C2 in the next state
- In the next state after the initial one, no events occur (because event2 already happened and it blocks further events).
- Therefore in that next state neither ""event2 happens"" nor ""event1 happens"" is true.
- So C2 is false in the next state.

4. Conclusion
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is just ""event1 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same clause).
- C2 is ""event2 happens or C1 holds"".
- Initially event2 happened, so C2 is true in the initial state (because event2 holds there).
- The problem states that after event2 no other events can happen. That means in the next state after the initial one neither event1 nor event2 happens.
- Therefore in that next state both disjuncts of C2 are false, so C2 does not hold there.
- C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state, which is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked:
   - C3 asserts that ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just ""Event1 happens.""
   - C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — so C2 is true whenever Event2 happens or Event1 happens.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""

3. Use the context:
   - Initially, Event2 happened. So in the initial state Event2 is true → C2 is true in the initial state.
   - After Event2, no other events can happen. Thus there is no later state in which Event1 or Event2 occurs. In particular, Event1 never occurs (it did not happen initially and cannot occur after Event2), and Event2 does not occur in any subsequent state.

4. Evaluate C3:
   - In the next state (if any), neither Event2 nor Event1 holds, so C2 is false there.
   - Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- C3 asserts: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide if C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event1 happened. (event1 is a fact)
  2. After event1, event2 must happen. (every occurrence of event1 is followed by event2)
  3. After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal)
- Hypothesis components:
  - C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (matches context fact 2) → C1 is true.
  - C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds. Since event1 is given initially and C1 holds, C2 is true.
  - C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds. We must evaluate this.

Step 3 — trace event sequences and implications
- Because event1 happened initially and C1 (the rule) holds, event2 must occur at some point after the initial event1.
- C1 holds globally from the context. Event1 already happened (initially), so the conjunct ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" (C2) is true in the actual history.
- Therefore, whenever event2 occurs in this scenario, C2 is already true (event1 already happened and C1 holds).

Conclusion
- C3 is true.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 is the claim ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and C1/C2
- Context states: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") — so C1 is true.
- Since event1 did happen initially and C1 is true, C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 is the conditional ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""
- In the actual timeline event2 does happen (it follows event1), and we already established C2 is true.
- A conditional with a true consequent is true; in this case both antecedent and consequent are true, so the implication holds.

Conclusion
True
---
Step-by-step:

1. Context gives: initially event1 happened.
2. Context also gives: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That is exactly C1, so C1 is true.
3. Since event1 happened and C1 holds, C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true.
4. C3 is ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is already true in the given context, so any conditional with C2 as consequent is true. Also, event2 does indeed happen (by C1), and in that run C2 holds, so the implication is satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- The question asks whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" i.e. C2 -> event2) is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (event2 -> event2). This is a logical tautology, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" (C1 ∨ event2). Since C1 holds, C2 holds regardless of whether event2 happens.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" (C2 -> event2). We must check this implication under the context.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context states that initially event2 happened. So event2 is true in the given situation.
- C2 is true (because C1 is true). With both antecedent (C2) true and consequent (event2) true, the implication C2 -> event2 is true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You ask whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
The context states: initially event2 happened. So event2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (disjunction with a true disjunct).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent (C2) is true and the consequent (event2) is true (from the context), so the implication C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — facts from the context:
- event2 happened (true).
- After event2 no other events can happen; after event1 no other events can happen. (These only constrain future events; they do not negate the fact that event2 happened.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true (from step 2), C2 is true (the disjunction is true).

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C2 is true (step 3) and the consequent event2 is true (step 1), so the implication is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
C3 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event2 happened (call that state 0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any state with event1 has a successor with event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any state with event2 has a successor with event1).

Thus the execution alternates: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, … (an infinite alternation).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At state0 (where event2 holds), the next state (state1) has event1, so C1 holds at state0. More generally, C1 holds at any state whose successor has event1 (i.e., at any state where event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at state0 (and will hold at every state with event2), C2 is true (there will be — indeed already is — a future state where C1 holds).

Step 4 — evaluate C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds""
Take any state S where event1 happens. By the context, the successor S+1 must have event2. At S+1 (where event2 holds) the next state S+2 must have event1, so C1 holds at S+1 (because its next state has event1). Therefore from S there exists a future state (S+1) where C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at S. Hence whenever event1 happens, C2 holds.

Conclusion
C3 is True.
---
First identify the intended meaning:
- The context: initially event2 has just happened. After any event1, event2 must happen next. After any event2, event1 must happen next. So the system alternates: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Interpret C1, C2, C3 as state formulas with temporal operators:
  - C1: ""event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the current state, next-state has event1).
  - C2: ""eventually C1 holds"" (there exists some future state where C1 is true).
  - C3: ""if event1 happens (now), then C2 holds (eventually C1 in the future of now).""

Examine each condition and trace sequences:
- At the initial state event2 has happened. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state must have event1. So C1 is true at the initial state.
- Since C1 is already true at the initial state, ""eventually C1"" holds as well. So C2 is true (it holds already, not just eventually).
- Now consider C3: suppose at some state s event1 happens. By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", at state s+1 event2 happens. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", at state s+2 event1 happens. Therefore at state s+1 the next state (s+2) has event1, so C1 is true at s+1. Thus from s there exists a future state (s+1) where C1 holds, so ""eventually C1"" holds from s. Hence the implication ""if event1 happens then C2 holds"" is true for any state where event1 occurs.

Conclusion: C3 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Let time 0 be the initial state. By the context, event2 happened at time 0.
- The two rules force alternation: after any event1 the next state has event2, and after any event2 the next state has event1. Starting from event2 at time 0 this yields the infinite alternating sequence: time 0: event2, time 1: event1, time 2: event2, time 3: event1, ... .
- C1 is ""event1 happens in the next state."" C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there is some future state where the next state has event1).
- Take any state t where event1 happens. By the rules, t+1 has event2 and then t+2 has event1. Therefore at state t+1, the next state (t+2) has event1, so C1 holds at t+1.
- Hence from state t (where event1 holds) there is a future state (t+1) at which C1 holds, so C2 holds at t.
- Therefore ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" is true in this system."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 happened initially, event2 will happen).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — examine the hypothesis components
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts Rule A combined with the initial event1, so C1 is false in the given context.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true in classical logic; moreover, event1 already happened initially, so C2 is true anyway.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Since event2 does indeed happen (from the context) and C2 is also true, the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — understand the context and implications
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means because event1 happened, event2 must (and therefore does) happen.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" makes event1 and event2 mutually forcing, but we only need the fact that event2 does happen (from the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the components
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 does happen (as deduced above).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" As a conditional, C2 is true: either because the antecedent C1 is false (making the implication vacuously true) or because event1 in fact did happen anyway.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Since event2 happens, C3 is true (indeed both disjuncts are true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the scenario and timeline
- State 0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By the rule “after event1, event2 must happen”, state 1: event2 happens.
- By the rule “after event2, no other events can happen”, there are no further event occurrences after state 1 (state 2 has no event2).

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens” — this is just equivalent to “event2 happens” at the current state.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — means at every state on the timeline (from the evaluated state forward), event2 happens.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — means at state 1, it should be true that C2 (i.e., event2 holds at every state from state 1 onward).

Step 3 — evaluate
- C1 is true at state 1 (event2 happens), false at state 0 and false at any later state with no events.
- C2 is false at the initial state because C1 is not true at state 0. C2 is also false at state 1 because although C1 is true at state 1, it does not hold at the subsequent (event-less) state.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalently, event2 holds in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — from the point of evaluation, in every (current and future) state C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — at the state immediately after the initial state, C2 is true.

Step 2 — model the scenario
- S0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", the next state S1 must have event2.
- By ""after event2, no other events can happen"", S1 is terminal (no further states after S1).

Step 3 — evaluate
- At S1, event2 holds, so C1 is true at S1.
- C2 (""always C1"") evaluated at S1 requires C1 at S1 and at all future states. There are no future states after S1, so C1 holds at all states from S1 onward (true at S1 and vacuously true for nonexistent future states). Therefore C2 is true at S1.
- C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state (S1). That is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Let's label states and events:

- State s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- Because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", the next state s1 has event2 happen.
- Because ""after event2, no other events can happen"", any later state s2 and onward have no events.

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". True in s1, false in s0 and s2.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — means C1 must be true in every state along the timeline. But C1 is false in s0 (and in s2), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C2 is true in s1. Since C2 is false (because s2 fails), C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", where C1 and C2 are each ""Event1 happens in the next state."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events occur in any later state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (this only constrains sequences where event2 occurs).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2:
- Both claim ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the context forbids any events after event1, no events (including event1) can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false and C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclude C3:
- C3 = C1 ∨ C2 = false ∨ false = false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The context says: initially event1 happened.
2. It also says that after event1, no other events can happen — so in every state following the initial one, no events (including event1) can occur.
3. Therefore ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false. C2 is the same statement, so it is also false.
4. C3 is ""C1 or C2"", which is false ∨ false = false.

So C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"".
- C1 and C2 both state: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C3 is true exactly when event1 happens in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events occur afterward).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
- Because event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no events in the next state. Therefore event1 does not happen in the next state.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is false, C2 is false, so C3 (C1 or C2) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 asserts “C2 does not hold” (i.e., C2 is false). We must determine whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initial state: event1 has already happened.
- Rule A: “After event2, event1 must happen” (if event2 occurs at some point, event1 must occur afterward).
- Rule B: “After event1, no other events can happen” — event1 is terminal: there are no successor states after a state in which event1 has happened.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” From the initial state (where event1 has happened) no further events can occur (by Rule B), so event2 cannot happen in the future. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” There is no next state after the initial state (because event1 is terminal), so C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 is false, this statement is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
First, what's asked: determine whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, there can be no future occurrences of any events.)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 would have to occur before that implication could matter.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. Given that event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur in the future. So C1 is false.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is false (there is no possible future where event2 happens), C1 is also false in the next state; therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred the system cannot produce any further events.
- The clause ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here unless event2 can occur; it only constrains traces where event2 does occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no further events can happen after event1, event2 cannot ever occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false (event2 will never happen), C1 is also false in any future state; therefore C2 is false. (If one prefers the view that there is no next state, C2 likewise does not hold.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer:

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 asserts: ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also: after event1, no other events can happen; after event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That requires event1 to occur in the immediate state following the current one.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means at some future moment, C1 is true (i.e., at some time t, event1 will occur in the next state t+1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That means at some future moment, C2 will be true.

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule says ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no events can occur after that initial occurrence. In particular, event1 cannot occur again in the next state (or any later state).
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- If C1 is never true in any future state, then ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.
- If C2 never becomes true, then ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is also false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts ""event1 happens in the next state."" The context says event1 already happened initially and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So there is no future state in which event1 can occur — the next state does not have event1.
- Therefore C1 is false now and will never become true.
- C2 is ""eventually C1 holds"" — since C1 never becomes true, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""eventually C2 holds."" Because C2 is never true, C3 is also false.

(Also note F F φ = F φ, so C3 reduces to C2; either way it is false.)
---
We are to decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine the truth value of C3 given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never happens given event1 happened initially).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since event1 already happened initially and the context says no events can happen after event1, in the next state no event can occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That would require there to be some future state where C1 is true. But because no events can happen after the initial event1, C1 can never become true in any future state. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" As C2 is never true (and cannot become true), C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""Event2 happens and C2 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Translate the context into facts
- Initially, event2 happened. → event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. → event1 will happen (and does happen) after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen. → no events occur after event1 (no contradiction with above).

Step 3 — Examine each condition in the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false, because the context states event2 did happen.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Moreover, from the context event1 does happen anyway (because event2 happened), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" We have event2 happens (true) and C2 holds (true), so the conjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the hypothesis: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context statements:
  - Initially, event2 happened. => event2 is true.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. => event1 is true (it happens after event2).
  - After event1, no other events can happen. => nothing relevant happens after event1.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is false (because event2 did happen).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is true:
  - In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true), and
  - independently, event1 does happen in the actual sequence, so the implication holds anyway.

Step 3 — combine for C3:
- ""Event2 happens"" is true.
- ""C2 holds"" is true.
- Therefore C3 (Event2 happens and C2 holds) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""Event2 happens and C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition against the context:
- Context says: initially event2 happened. So ""Event2 happens"" is true.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is an implication with antecedent C1. Since C1 is false, the implication is true (vacuously). Also independently the context requires that after event2, event1 must happen, so event1 will indeed happen — but that isn’t required for the truth of C2 because C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
C3 = (Event2 happens) AND (C2 holds). We have Event2 happens = true, and C2 = true, so C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide the truth of C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"", where
  - C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"",
  - C1 = ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1 is a logical tautology: ""if event1 then event1"" is true in any state where the truth of propositions is evaluated.
- C2 says that C1 is true in the next state. For C2 to be true, a next state must exist and C1 must hold there. Since C1 is a tautology it would hold in any state, so C2 would be true iff a next state exists.
- C3 says that C2 is true in the next state, i.e. there must be a next state and in that next state C2 must hold (which itself requires that that next state has a successor where C1 holds).

Step 3 — use the context about events
- Initially event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Interpreting transitions as driven by events, this means the initial state has no successor state (there is no next state after the initial event2 state).

Step 4 — conclude
- Because there is no next state after the initial state, ""holds in the next state"" is false when evaluated at the initial state. Thus C2 is false in the initial state, and therefore C3 (which requires C2 to hold in a next state) is false as well.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Goal: decide whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true in the given context.
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2 no other events can happen. So the initial state is a terminal state — there is no next state.
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"") is a tautology and so true in any state.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") requires a next state where C1 holds. Because there is no next state, C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") likewise requires a next state; with no next state, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — understand the context:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen → the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur).

Step 2 — examine C1, C2, C3:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A), so C1 is true in any state, including the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This requires a next state where C1 is true. But there is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This requires a next state in which C2 is true. Again, there is no next state, so C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — examine each claim
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication of the form A → A), so C1 is true unconditionally.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true regardless, C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Because C2 is true regardless, C3 is true as well.

Step 2 — check consistency with the context
- The context (event2 happened initially; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 no other events) does not contradict the above. In particular, event2 did happen, and that only reinforces the antecedent of C3; but C2 is already true independently.

Conclusion
True
---
You ask whether C3 is true or false. Short answer: True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Restating the context:
   - Initially event2 happened (so event2 does occur).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 happens then event2 happens).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2. Examine C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 is true.

3. Examine C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is already true unconditionally, C2 is true regardless. (Even if one prefers temporal reasoning: event1 never occurs because event2 happened initially and prevents later events, so C2 would be vacuously true.)

4. Examine C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially). But C2 is true (as shown in step 3), so the implication in C3 holds. Therefore C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), hence C1 is always true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, the implication (event1 → C1) is true regardless of whether event1 happens. So C2 is always true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Because C2 is always true, the implication (event2 → C2) is true regardless of event2.

Step 3 — Check consistency with the context
- The context (initially event2 happened; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 no other events can happen) does not contradict the above logical truths. Even though event1 cannot occur after event2, C2 and C1 remain tautologically true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First, the question asks whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Examine the conditions:
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just the same conjunct twice, so C1 simplifies to: ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. ""event2 will eventually happen.""
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" — i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event2 will eventually occur (again) later.

Trace the allowed event sequences under the context:
- At time 0 event1 has happened.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" there must be an event2 sometime after that.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" any event2 is followed by an event1, which in turn (by the first rule) must be followed by another event2.
- Thus once event2 occurs, the obligations force an event1 and then another event2 later. So any occurrence of event2 guarantees a later occurrence of event2.

Therefore C3 holds in all traces allowed by the context. Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 states: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Equivalently: event2 → (eventually C1).
- C1 is essentially ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction repeats the same proposition).
- C2 is ""eventually C1"", i.e. ""eventually event2 happens"".

Step 2 — understand the context rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 holds initially, some event2 will occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen, and then after that event2 must happen, etc. So the system forces an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C3 under these dynamics
- Under the alternation, event2 does occur (in fact infinitely often).
- If event2 happens at some time t, then there is an event1 after it and hence another event2 after that — so there will be a (strict) future occurrence of event2. Even if ""eventually"" allows the current time, it is still satisfied immediately.
- Therefore whenever event2 happens, C2 (""eventually event2"") holds.

Final answer:
True
---
First identify what C3 says:
- C1 is ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction ""event2 and event2"" is just event2).
- C2 is ""eventually C1 holds"" = ""eventually event2 happens"".
- C3 is ""if event2 happens, then eventually event2 happens.""

Examine the context rules:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Trace the implications:
- From the initial event1, event2 must occur at some time.
- After that event2, event1 must occur, and then (because of the second rule) event2 must occur again, and so on.
- Thus once event2 occurs, there will be a future event1 and then a future event2 — so event2 will occur again (indeed infinitely often).

Therefore whenever event2 happens, it is guaranteed that event2 will happen again in the future, so ""if event2 happens then eventually event2 happens"" is satisfied.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step by step):
- Let s0 be the initial state: event2 happened there.
- By the rules, s1 must have event1, s2 must have event2, s3 event1, etc. (alternating).

Evaluate at s0:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen (in the current state s0)."" True, because s0 has event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state (i.e. C1 at s1)."" False, because s1 has event1, so C1(s1) is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state (i.e. C2 at s1)."" True, because C2(s1) says C1 holds at s2, and s2 has event2 (so event1 does not happen there), so C1(s2) is true. Therefore C2(s1) is true, so C3 at s0 is true.
---

---
Step 1 — identify what is asked
- We evaluate C3 at the initial state (where initially event2 happened).
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (at the state where it is asserted).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the following state, event1 does not happen).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state, the next state's C1 holds — equivalently, two steps ahead, C1 holds).

Step 2 — trace the forced sequence
- S0 (initial): event2 happened.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", S1: event1 happens.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", S2: event2 happens.
- The pattern alternates: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3 at S0
- C1 at S0: ""event1 does not happen"" — true (S0 has event2).
- C2 at S0: ""C1 holds in S1"" — false, because in S1 event1 does happen, so C1 is false in S1.
- C3 at S0: ""C2 holds in S1"" — check C2 in S1: C2 at S1 says ""C1 holds in S2"". In S2 event2 happens, so indeed event1 does not happen there, so C1 is true in S2, so C2 is true in S1. Therefore C3 is true at S0.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event2 cannot happen at any time after the initial event1.
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event2 cannot occur).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a material implication of the form P -> P, which is a tautology; it is true regardless of whether event2 can occur. In the given context event2 is impossible, so the antecedent is false; a false antecedent makes the implication true (vacuously true).
- C2 is the same as C1, so by the same reasoning it is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 states C1 -> C2. Since both C1 and C2 are true (either as tautologies or vacuously true because event2 cannot occur), the implication ""if C1 then C2"" is true. Even without relying on their truth values, the implication is trivial here because C1 and C2 are identical forms (P -> P), so C1 -> C2 holds.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in all situations.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is also a tautology and therefore true.

(Background context — event1 happened and no other events can happen — makes event2 impossible, but that only reinforces that any implication with ""event2 happens"" as antecedent is vacuously true. Either way C1 and C2 are true.)

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 is the implication C1 → C2. Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C1 → C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so it is true in any model.
- C2: identical to C1, so also a tautology and thus true.

Step 3 — Use the context to check consistency:
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 does not happen. That only reinforces that C1 and C2 are true (they are vacuously true when event2 does not occur).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — Evaluate C3:
- Since C1 holds (true) and C2 holds (true), the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 states: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide if, given the context, the conditional C2 is true in all possible situations (so that the universal claim C3 is true).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So every possible execution / history begins with event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So any execution that has event1 has no further events.
- (There is also the fact ""after event2, no other events can happen"", but since event1 happens initially and blocks further events, event2 cannot occur in any actual execution.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, every execution starts with event1 and no events occur afterwards, so event1 occurs in every execution. Therefore C1 holds.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In every execution, event1 does happen (initially), and we just established C1 holds. So the implication ""if event1 happens then C1"" is true in every execution. (Even if considered pointwise, any execution where event1 occurs cannot be one where C1 fails, because C1 is true globally.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true in every execution, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---

---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The context says: initially event1 happened (so event1 occurs at time 0). It also says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" That prevents any further events, but it does not make the instantaneous occurrence of event1 true at every later time point.

- Interpret ""always happens"" (C1) as ""event1 holds at every time point (globally)"". Event1 happens at time 0 but does not continually occur at later times, so C1 is false.

- C2 is the implication ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" At time 0 the antecedent is true (event1 happened) but the consequent C1 is false, so C2 is false at that time.

- C3 says C2 always holds (C2 is true at every time). Since C2 is false at time 0, C3 is false.

Thus C3 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 holds.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 also holds.

(Separately, from the scenario: event2 happened initially and forces event1 to happen afterward, so event1 does occur; that only reinforces that C1 and C2 are true in this system, though they are tautologically true regardless.)

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must determine whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological conditional (p → p) and so is true in any interpretation. Also, from the context event1 does in fact occur (event2 happens initially and after event2 event1 must happen), so the antecedent holds and the consequent holds.
- C2 is identical to C1, so it is also true for the same reasons.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 says C1 ⇒ C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same true statement, C1 implies C2. Thus C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is True or False given the conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Let p be the proposition ""event1 happens"".
- C1: p → p.
- C2: p → p.
  (Both C1 and C2 are the same implication.)
- C3: (p → p) → (p → p).

Step 3 — logical evaluation
- For any proposition p, p → p is a tautology (always true).
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true in every case.
- An implication whose antecedent and consequent are both true is itself true; here C3 is also a tautology.

(Separately, the given event context even ensures p becomes true, but that is irrelevant because p → p is true regardless.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- We are asked whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (identical to C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication between the same proposition.

Step 3 — trace the context:
- The context states that initially event1 happened, so ""event1 happens"" is true. Therefore C1 (event2 or event1) is true and so is C2.
- Regardless of the context, the implication A → A (a statement implying itself) is a logical tautology and is always true.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Since C1 and C2 are identical (and in fact true in the context) and because any proposition implies itself, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the conditions.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
They are the same proposition (identical disjunction).

Step 3 — logical relation
- Any proposition implies itself. For any formula A, A → A is always true.
- Therefore C1 → C2 is a tautology independent of the background event constraints.

Step 4 — check consistency with the context (optional)
- The context actually makes C1 and C2 true (initially event1 happened), so the antecedent and consequent are both true; the implication holds as well.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""
- C1 and C2 are identical: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""

Step 2 — what the context gives
- Initially event1 happened → ""event1 happens"" is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → no new events occur after that, so event2 cannot occur later (but we already have event1 true).
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" doesn't contradict anything given event1 already happened.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event1 happened, the disjunction ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" is true. So C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C1 and C2 are identical, so ""if C1 then C2"" is true (indeed true→true here; and generally an implication from a statement to itself is a tautology).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the definitions and the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (a conjunction: both occur)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., eventually both event2 and event1 occur.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" — an implication from C2 to event1.

Step 3 — logical relation between C2 and event1
- By definition, C2 asserts that C1 (event2 AND event1) eventually holds. Any state satisfying C2 therefore includes event1. So C2 logically entails event1. Therefore the implication C2 → event1 is true by construction.

Step 4 — check against the context (consistency)
- The context (event2 happened initially; after event2 no other events can happen; after event1 event2 must happen) makes C2 impossible in any actual run (event1 cannot occur after the initial event2). But an implication with a false antecedent is also true (vacuously). So even considering the context, C3 remains true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Understand the goal
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no further events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event1 requires a later occurrence of event2).

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the context, event2 does happen (initially). But because after event2 no other events can happen and event2 has already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur. So event1 cannot occur. Therefore C1 is false in this situation.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is false and no future events can make event1 true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). There is no requirement that C2 actually holds; the conditional is satisfied because C2 does not hold.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 states: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e. C2 → event1)

Step 2 — examine the scenario
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is terminal, so no event can occur after that initial event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen (but that only matters if event1 could occur before event2).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 requires both event2 happens and event1 happens. Event2 does happen initially, but event1 cannot happen because once event2 has happened no further events can occur. Therefore event1 never happens, so C1 is false.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never holds, C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is the implication ""if C2 then event1"". The antecedent C2 is false in every possible execution, so the implication is vacuously true (there is no case where C2 is true and event1 is false).

- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (Also: after event1 no other events can happen.)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, event2 did happen initially, so C1 is false.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now (vacuously), so it certainly holds at some time (immediately), hence it ""eventually holds.""

Step 3 — conclude
- C3 is True.
---
We are asked whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

1. From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false (event2 does happen).
2. C2 is the implication ""if C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Because C1 is false in the actual run, the implication C2 is vacuously true.
3. C2 is already true now, so ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says “C2 eventually holds.” We must decide whether C2 becomes true (or is true at some time) given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens.
- C3: C2 eventually holds.

Step 3 — reason about truth values
- From the context, event2 did happen (it happened initially). Therefore C1 (“event2 does not happen”) is false.
- C2 is a material implication: “If C1 then event1.” An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). So C2 is true immediately.
- If C2 is already true now, then C2 “eventually holds” is also true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- event1 happened initially → event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 is true (it occurs sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen → irrelevant for these propositions except that event2 does occur and is terminal.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunction that is true because event1 happened. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" — event2 does happen (from the context), but C2 is false. So the implication has a true antecedent and a false consequent, making C3 false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once the initial event1 has occurred, no additional events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is a constraint that if event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime after it; but we already have event1 initially.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given that event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur; therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 does happen (initially), C2 is true (the disjunction is satisfied).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 is true and C2 is true, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s being asked
C3 is the claim ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" We must decide whether that claim is true given the context.

Step 2 — the context facts
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen (at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 were to occur, event1 would have to occur after it.)

Step 3 — consequences for the Ci
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): impossible, because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after that, so event2 cannot occur. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds""): event1 does happen (true), so C2 is true regardless of C1.
- C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds""): event1 is true and C2 is true, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C3 (Event1 happens and C2 holds) is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no events can occur at any later time.
- After event2, event1 must happen. This would require event1 to occur after any event2, but because event1 already happened initially and prevents later events, event2 cannot occur (there is no time for it to occur).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 occurred initially and forbids any later events, event2 cannot occur at all. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Event1 does happen (given), so C2 is true regardless of C1.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 is true and C2 is true, so their conjunction C3 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- What is being asked: C3 says ""C2 eventually holds"", i.e. there exists some future state where C1 is true in the next state.

- Interpret the conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — effectively: event2 happens (a tautological duplication).
  - C2: C1 holds in the next state — i.e. the immediate successor state has event2.
  - C3: Eventually there is a state whose successor has event2.

- Use the context:
  - Initially event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the initial state).
  - After event2, no other events can happen — once event2 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences in any future state.
  - The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" cannot create additional event2 occurrences because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2 (no events can happen after event2).

- Conclusion:
  - Event2 occurs only at the initial state, not in any successor state. So C2 is false at the initial state, and there is no future state where C2 becomes true.
  - Therefore C3 is false.
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same proposition).
2. C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, event2 must happen.
3. C3 says ""eventually there is a state where C2 holds"" — i.e., at some future state its next state has event2.

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened (so C1 holds at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means there are no further occurrences of events in any subsequent state; in particular, event2 does not occur in any later state.
- Therefore there is no state whose next state contains event2, so C2 is false at every state, and thus C2 never becomes true.

Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 (""Event2 happens or event2 happens"") is just a tautological repetition and simplifies to ""event2 happens"" (i.e. event2 holds in that state).

- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state (i.e. event2 holds in the next state).

- C3 says that C2 eventually holds (i.e. at some future state, event2 holds in the following state).

- From the context: initially event2 happened. Crucially, ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means there is no subsequent state where another event (or event2 again) can occur — there is no transition to a state where event2 holds again. Thus there is no future state that satisfies ""event2 holds in the next state.""

- Therefore C2 never holds, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Let S0 be the initial state. At S0, event1 happened (given).
- The context says: after event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened at S0, no events occur in the next state S1 (or any later state).
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") evaluated at S0 is false, because no events occur in S1.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" At S0, C1 is false, so C2 is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., evaluate C2 at S1. At S1:
  - event1 does not happen in S1, and event1 does not happen in S2 either (no events ever after S0), so C1 (from S1’s perspective) is false.
  - Therefore the implication C2 is again vacuously true at S1.
- Hence C2 holds in the next state (S1), so C3 is True.
---

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred (and it has, initially), there are no further (next) states in which any event occurs — in particular there is no next state where events happen.

2. Evaluate C1 (Event1 happens in the next state).
   - Because no events can happen after the initial event1, there is no next state in which event1 occurs. So C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2 (If C1 holds, then event1 happens).
   - This is a simple implication. In the current (initial) state C1 is false, so the implication C2 is vacuously true in the current state.

4. Evaluate C3 (C2 holds in the next state).
   - C3 requires that C2 hold in the next state. But there is no next state (no events can happen after event1), so C2 cannot be said to hold in a next state. Under the usual interpretation that a statement ""holds in the next state"" is false when there is no next state, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what is asked
- C3 asserts: ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event2 has happened (so at the initial state event2 is true).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- After event2 happens, no further events can happen (the system becomes terminal).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From the context, event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, so event2 does not occur in the next state. Therefore C1 is false at the initial state and will never become true later.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never holds at any future state (no further events occur), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is never true at any future state, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First, the hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 has happened (so at the initial state event2 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, a subsequent state must have event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state).

Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no later state in which event2 occurs. Therefore C1 is false at the initial state and cannot become true later.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never becomes true at any future time, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is never true, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
C3 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2 = ""eventually C1 holds"" (there will be some future state at which C1 is true).
- C3 = ""eventually C2 holds"" which is equivalent to C2 (since ""eventually eventually p"" = ""eventually p"").

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means no future state can contain any event (including event2 or event1).
- Therefore there is no future time at which event2 occurs in the next state, so C1 never becomes true at any time.
- Hence C2 is false, and therefore C3 is also false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; it is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (call this proposition P).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Identical to C1, so C2 is the same proposition P.

Step 3 — reason about the implication and the context:
- C3 is the implication P → P. An implication of a proposition to itself is a tautology (always true).
- The context (event2 happened initially, and event2 necessitates event1) also ensures P holds, but that is not needed: even without using the context, P → P is always true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C3 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" which is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens.""
- C2 is identical to C1, so C1 ⇔ C2.

Step 3 — use the context:
- The context ensures event2 happened initially and forces event1 to happen afterward, so ""Event1 happens"" is true; hence both C1 and C2 are true. Even without the context, any formula implies itself.

Conclusion:
- The implication C1 ⇒ C2 is true.

True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
C3 states: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens.""
C2: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens.""
Both are identical; each is equivalent to the single claim ""Event1 happens.""

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate C1 and C2:
Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does happen (at least once). Hence C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
An implication with a true antecedent and a true consequent is true. Also, A -> A is a tautology. Therefore C3 is True.

- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same literal).

- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (C2 is false).

- (The other sentence ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (""event2 happens"") is false (event2 never occurs).
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state (so ""in the next state"" cannot be satisfied).
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold; since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step-by-step:

- Context facts:

  2. After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, no further events — including event2 — can occur.)
  3. After event2, no other events can happen. (This is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

- Interpret the hypothesis:
  - C1 = ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction given is just event2 or event2).
  - C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" → ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" → ""It is not the case that event2 happens in the next state.""

- Reasoning:
  - Since event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen in any subsequent state.
  - Therefore C1 is false, and C2 (that event2 holds in the next state) is false.

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (always next(event2)).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" (event1 → always next(event2)).

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the state after the initial one has no events).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- From the initial state (where event2 happened), the next state has no events, so event2 does not happen in that next state. Thus C1 is false in the initial state.
- Because C1 fails in that (initial) state, C2 (""always C1"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 (event1 → C2)
- In the actual system traces, event1 never happens (initially event2 occurred and that is terminal), so the antecedent ""event1 happens"" is false.
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Therefore C3 is true in the model.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify what's being asked
- C3 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
So once event2 has occurred (and it did initially), no further events are possible; in particular, event1 cannot occur in any reachable state.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given event2 already happened initially and no further events can happen after event2, C1 does not hold in the initial state's successor — C1 is false in the relevant scenario.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is not true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Because event1 never happens (it cannot happen after the initial event2), there is no case with event1 true and C2 false. The implication is therefore vacuously true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the context, whenever event1 or event2 happens, no further events can occur in the following state. 
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is therefore false in any state immediately after event1 or event2. 
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because there are states (those after event1 or event2) where C1 fails.
- C3 asserts: if event1 happens, then C2 holds. But if event1 happens, we are in a state where C2 is false (as just shown). So the implication is false in that case.

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, and then C3:
- C1 asserts event2 in the next state; from the trace, that is false (next state has event1).
- C2 is the same assertion, so also false.
- C3 is the implication ""if C1 then C2."" An implication P → P (or more generally false antecedent) is true (here both sides are identical, and with a false antecedent it's vacuously true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""
- C1 and C2 are both the same claim: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine conditions / trace events
- Context forces alternation: initial state had event2, then next state has event1, then next has event2, etc.
- So in the immediate next state after the initial state, event2 does not occur (event1 does). That makes C1 false in that particular moment — but that detail is not needed for the logical form below.

Step 3 — logical reasoning about C3
- C3 has the form P → P where P = ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- Any statement of the form P → P is a tautology (always true). Even if P is false, P → P is true (false → false is true).

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C3 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
They are the same proposition.

Step 3 — logical reasoning:
- An implication P → P is always true (a proposition implies itself regardless of truth value).

Step 4 — relation to the context:
- The given temporal constraints (initial event2 and the mutual after-relations) do not affect the logical truth that C1 → C2, because the antecedent and consequent are identical.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context and conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So starting from the initial event2, event1 will (must) occur next (and they alternate thereafter).
- C2 is ""event1 happens or C1 holds."" C3 is the implication ""C2 → event1.""

Step 3 — reason about truth values
- From the context, event1 does happen (it must happen after the initial event2). Thus the proposition ""event1 happens"" is true.
- Therefore C2 is true (because its left disjunct, ""event1 happens,"" is true).
- C3 is the implication ""if C2 then event1."" With C2 true and event1 true, the implication is true.
- Also note C3 could only be false if C2 were true while event1 were false; that would mean C2 is true solely because C1 holds (event2 always happens) while event1 does not happen. But that situation contradicts the context rule that after any event2 (including the initial one) event1 must happen. So such a counterexample is impossible.

Final answer
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context gives an alternating obligation starting from event2: initial event2 → event1 must happen → event2 must happen → event1 must happen → ... So event1 does occur (immediately after the initial event2), and the two events repeat indefinitely.

2. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") holds in this system because after every event1 an event2 must follow, so event2 recurs forever.

3. C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true (indeed both disjuncts hold: event1 happens and C1 holds).

4. C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"") requires that whenever C2 is true, event1 is true. In this system there is no way for C2 to be true solely because C1 holds while event1 does not: if event2 always happens, the context forces event1 to happen after those event2 occurrences. Thus whenever C2 holds, event1 indeed happens.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
First identify what’s being asked: C3 is the implication “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” We must decide whether C3 is true given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So event1 does occur (it follows the initial event2), and then the two events alternate.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” This is not supported by the context in the strong sense of “always” (there are steps when event1 occurs), so C1 is not established.
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds.” Since event1 does happen in the described sequence, C2 is true (its disjunction is satisfied by event1 happening).

Now C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.”
- We have C2 true (because event1 happens), and the consequent “event1 happens” is also true.
- Therefore the implication C3 is true in this scenario (true antecedent and true consequent).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 always happens.""
They are the same statement.

Step 3 — reason from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does occur.
- After event1 no other events can happen.
Thus, in this scenario event1 does always happen (given the initial condition), so C1 and C2 are both true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- An implication from a statement to itself (A → A) is always true.
- Here C1 and C2 are identical (and in fact true), so ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some point after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context (event2 happened initially and forces event1), event1 does indeed always happen.
- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" This is the same claim as C1, so it also holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 says: if C1 holds then C2 holds. Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition (and both true here), the implication C1 → C2 is true (indeed P → P is always true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (C1 and C2 are both ""Event1 always happens"".)

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- The only possible sequence is: event2 → event1 → (no further events).
- Therefore event1 does occur in every possible run.

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, and C3
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is true.
- C2 (""Event1 always happens"") is true.
- C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true (both because C1 ⇒ C2 holds when both are true, and also because the antecedent equals the consequent).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked:
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from the initial event1, event2 will eventually occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 will occur again, and the cycle continues).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" C2 is the same statement as C1, so it is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical and both true, the implication is true (and in general p → p is always true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 asserts the implication ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
They are the same proposition.

Step 3 — trace the events from the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to happen eventually. So C1 is true (and therefore C2 is also true).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- Since C1 and C2 are identical propositions (and in the model C1 is true), the implication ""if C1 then C2"" holds. More generally, any proposition implies itself, so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 eventually happens.
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So starting from the initial event1, event2 must occur (and then event1 again, etc.). Thus event2 does eventually happen. So C1 is true; C2 is the same statement, so C2 is also true.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is the implication “if C1 then C2.” Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition (both true here), the implication C1 → C2 is true (indeed P → P is a tautology).

- We must determine whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Thus no event can occur after event1; in particular event2 cannot occur after event1.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Not directly needed, but symmetric.)

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 happened, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to happen. But event2 cannot happen because event1 already happened and prevents any subsequent events. Therefore event2 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication with antecedent C2, which is false in the given context. A conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Also, in the actual context event1 already holds regardless.

Final answer
True

Step-by-step:

1. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true (it occurred).
2. Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can happen afterwards. Therefore event2 does not occur.
3. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 happens, C1 is true.
4. Evaluate C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 is false, so the conjunction is false; C2 is false.
5. Evaluate C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication C2 → event1. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer: True

- C2 = (event2 happens) and C1. Because event2 did not happen, C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether this conditional is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This requires event1 at all relevant times.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 entails C1 (event1 always) and that event1 happens now/at some time.
- C3: the implication from C2 to ""event2 happens.""

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no events can occur after that initial moment. That makes ""event1 always happens"" impossible (it would require event1 after the initial event2, which is forbidden). Thus C1 cannot hold in any model satisfying the context.
- Therefore C2 (which requires C1) is impossible/false in every model consistent with the context.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Also, independently, event2 did happen initially, so the consequent ""event2 happens"" is true in every model anyway.

Conclusion
C3 is True.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the conditional ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen (relevant only if event1 can occur).

Step 3 — examine the conditions in the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (This asserts event1 occurs in the possible history.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (So C2 entails event1 occurs and in fact always occurs.)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 4 — trace possible event sequences consistent with the context
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, there is no way for event1 to occur in any allowed sequence. Thus C1 is false in every model of the context, and therefore C2 is false in every model.

Step 5 — evaluate C3
- If the antecedent C2 is false in all models, the implication C2 → event2 is true (vacuously true) in all models of the context. Therefore C3 holds given the context.

Final answer: True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: event2 happens initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 cannot (and does not) occur at any time.

2. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because event1 does not occur at all.

3. C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false because event1 does not happen (and C1 is false).

4. C3 is ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C2 is false under the given context, C3 is True."

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 already happened initially, event1 happens in the next state. So C1 is true.
- After event1 no other events can happen. That means once event1 occurs, event2 cannot occur afterward.

Step 1 — identify the question
- C3 asserts: ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether that is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context: initially (state s0) event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state s1 event1 occurs). After event1 no other events can happen (no events after s1).
- C1: event1 happens in the next state — this is true (s1).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This statement does not restrict timing of event2; it only asserts that if event1 occurs in the next state, event2 happens (somewhere).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Since event2 happened initially (s0) and C1 is true (event1 in s1), the implication ""if C1 then event2"" is true: event2 does indeed happen (it already occurred in s0). Thus C2 holds.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" But we just showed C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
True.

Reason: From the context, event2 already happened and event1 must occur next (so C1 holds). But after event1 no further events can occur, so event2 cannot occur after C1; therefore the conditional C2 (""if C1 then event2"") fails, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". Both C1 and C2 state ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (they are identical). So C3 asks whether both events occur (at least once).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 did happen, that requirement forces event1 to occur sometime afterward.
- After event1, event2 must happen. That would force event2 again, but it's not needed to establish that both events occur at least once.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ensures event1 happens. Therefore both event2 and event1 occur, so C1 (and C2) hold.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 says: (Event2 happens and Event1 happens) OR (Event2 happens and Event1 happens). So C3 is equivalent to “Event2 happens and Event1 happens.”

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened. (So Event2 happens is true.)
- After Event2, Event1 must happen. (So given Event2 happened initially, Event1 will happen afterward.)
- The rule “after Event1, Event2 must happen” may produce further occurrences but is not needed to establish the first occurrences.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At time 0: Event2 happens (given).
- Because after Event2 event1 must happen, at some later time Event1 happens.
- Therefore both Event2 and Event1 happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 (and C2) are true, so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the question:
C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". C1 and C2 both assert ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" So C3 is effectively asking whether both event2 and event1 happen.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so because event2 occurred, event1 must occur at some later time).
- After event1, event2 must happen (this enforces further alternation but is not needed to show both events occur at least once).

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
Given the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen. Thus both event2 and event1 occur (so C1 is true, and hence C2 is also true since it is identical).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the described event constraints.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 does occur (at least once, immediately after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen, and the two alternate thereafter.
- So event2 does indeed occur in the execution (in fact infinitely often).

Step 3 — examine the hypothesis components
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Regardless of how strict “always” is interpreted, we do not need C1 to decide C3.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen in the run, the disjunction ""event2 happens or C1"" is true. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is already true, and event2 also happens, so the disjunction is true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, event2 must occur.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- Thus the system produces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... So event2 does occur (in fact infinitely often, at every other step).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted strictly as “at all times” this is false (because event1 occurs at some steps). But we do not need C1 to be true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen, the disjunction is true regardless of C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is true (and event2 also happens), so this disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the target:
- C3 is ""C2 holds or event2 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e. C2 is true if either event2 happens or event2 always happens)

Step 3 — trace the event sequence:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules force event2 to happen after event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen, then event2 again, and so on.
- Therefore event2 does happen (indeed repeatedly).

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- ""Event2 happens"" is true, so C2 (event2 happens or C1) is true.
- Since C2 is true (and event2 is true), C3 (""C2 or event2"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 asserts the same as C1.
- C3 asserts: C1 holds and C2 holds — so C3 is true exactly when both C1 and C2 are true (which is equivalent here to event1 happens and event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 definitely happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus no events can occur at any time after that initial event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen. That is a rule: if event1 occurs, then event2 must occur after it.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event2 already happens initially and nothing can happen after it, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2.
- The only way event1 could also have happened is if it occurred before that initial event2. The context gives no information that event1 did occur before event2; it only guarantees event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" would be satisfied if event1 occurred before the known event2, but the context does not assert that event1 actually happened at any time.

Step 4 — conclusion about C1/C2/C3:
- We know event2 happens, but we do not know that event1 happens. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (and likewise C2 is not guaranteed).
- Since C3 requires event1 to occur (as well as event2), C3 is not satisfied by the given context.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts: C1 holds and C2 holds. C1 and C2 each assert “Event2 happens and event1 happens.”

Step 2 — understand the context rules:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred at the start.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event1) can occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This would require event1 to occur before event2.)

Step 3 — examine whether event1 can happen:
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2.
- Event1 cannot have occurred before the initial event2 (initial means it is the first event), so there is no time for event1 to have happened prior.
- Therefore event1 cannot have happened at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, and C3:
- C1 (“event2 happens and event1 happens”) is false (event1 does not happen).
- C2 is the same, so also false.
- C3 requires both C1 and C2 to be true, but both are false, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"".
- C1 and C2 are the same: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"".
So C3 is true exactly when both event1 and event2 happen.

Step 2 — use the context constraints
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred at the start.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus no event (including event1) can occur after that initial event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So if event1 were to occur, event2 must occur after it.

Step 3 — attempt to satisfy ""event1 and event2 happen""
- Event2 already happened initially, so event1 cannot occur after it (because nothing can happen after event2).
- For event1 to occur and still satisfy ""after event1 event2 must happen"", event1 would have to occur before event2. But the context gives event2 as the initial (starting) event, so there is no allowed time before it for event1.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at any allowed time; hence the conjunction ""event1 and event2 happen"" is not satisfiable.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, C2 is false, and thus C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 claims ""C2 always holds"". We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (they force each other to occur eventually).
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — redundant; effectively says event1 happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — i.e., both event1 and event2 happen (C1 ∧ event2).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., at every time point both event1 and event2 hold.

Step 3 — trace and reason
At the initial moment only event2 has happened (context says ""initially, event2 happened""). So event1 has not happened at that moment, hence C1 is false at the initial moment, so C2 is false at the initial moment. Therefore C2 does not hold always.

Even though the rules force event1 and event2 to keep occurring alternately afterward, that does not make C2 true at the initial time (nor guarantee both hold simultaneously at every time).

Conclusion
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After any event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward. After any event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward. So the events force alternation (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...), with event2 already having occurred initially.
- C1 = ""event1 happens"" (the repetition is redundant).
- C2 = ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — i.e., both events occur (at some points).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., at every moment (always) the conjunction ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — trace the timeline and evaluate
- At the initial moment we know event2 has happened, but event1 has not yet happened. Therefore C2 is false at that initial moment (because event1 hasn't happened yet).
- Since C2 is not true at that time, C2 does not hold at all times. Thus ""C2 always holds"" is false.
- (Even if later both events occur repeatedly, ""always"" requires C2 to hold at every moment, which is not satisfied.)

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" So we must decide whether, given the context, C2 is true at every moment.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (redundant conjunct).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens AND Event2 happens"" (both hold).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — at every time point, both events must hold.

Step 3 — reason about the event sequence
From the context we get an alternating obligation: because event2 happened initially, event1 must occur (after that), and then event2 must occur, and so on. This yields a sequence where events occur in alternation (E2, then E1, then E2, ...). That does not imply both events hold simultaneously at every moment.

Counterexample/timepoint: at the initial moment E2 has happened but E1 has not yet happened, so C2 (E1 ∧ E2) is false at that moment. Therefore C2 is not true always.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: C3 says ""C2 eventually holds"", where C2 is ""C1 always holds"" and C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""

2. Examine each condition:
   - C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., Event1 never occurs).
   - C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., from now on, Event1 never occurs).
   - C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., there is some future point after which Event1 never occurs).

3. Trace the events from the context:
   - Initially, Event2 happened.
   - After Event2, Event1 must happen → therefore Event1 does occur.
   - After Event1, no other events can happen.

4. Consequences:
   - Since Event1 does occur, C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
   - Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
   - C3 would require that at some future time C2 becomes true (i.e., from that time onward Event1 never occurs). But Event1 does occur (after Event2), so there is no future time from which ""Event1 never occurs"" holds. Hence C3 is false.

Sample responses:
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So we must decide whether, given the context, C2 is true in the state immediately following the current one.

Examine the conditions and context:
- Context: Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (Also: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" — we'll consider this but it won't be needed.)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., Event1 does happen.)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, Event1 happens.)

Reasoning through sequences:
1. Because initially event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen, no event can occur at or after the initial state. In particular, event1 cannot occur at any time.
2. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
3. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. event1 does happen) is false in the current state.
4. Since no events can occur after the initial state, in the next state event1 still does not happen, so C1 remains true and C2 remains false in the next state.
5. Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must determine whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once that initial event2 has occurred, event1 can never occur at any later point.
- The clause ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs (given the second clause).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, event1 indeed never happens. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false now and no events can change that (there are no further events after the initial event2), C2 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs there can be no subsequent occurrence of any other event).

Interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e. event1 is not true in the current state)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 says event1 does happen (in the current state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So C3 asserts that event1 holds in the next state.

Reasoning
- In the initial state event2 happened, so event1 does not hold there; hence C1 holds and C2 is false in the initial state.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur in any subsequent state. Thus there is no next state in which event1 becomes true (if no next eventful state exists, X(C2) cannot be made true).
- Therefore C2 cannot hold in the next state, so C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the formulas:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — i.e. both events occur (and once an event has happened it remains true that it has happened).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 is true at every future point (an invariant).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there is some point after which C1 holds forever.

Step 2 — use the context to get the event sequence:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur at some later time.
- When event1 happens, ""no other events can happen"" — from that point the past occurrences (event2 and event1) are fixed.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- After event1 occurs, both events have happened, so C1 is true from that point onward.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is not true from the initial moment (event1 hasn't happened yet), but it becomes true once event1 has occurred.
- Therefore there is a time (the moment right after event1) after which C2 holds permanently.

Conclusion: C3 is True.
---
First identify what’s being asked:
- C1 = “Event1 happens and Event2 happens” (taken as a proposition about the current instant).
- C2 = “C1 always holds” = G C1 (at every time instant, both events happen).
- C3 = “C2 eventually holds” = F G C1 (at some future time, from then on C1 is always true).

Examine the given system behavior:
- Initially (at time 0) Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen → Event1 occurs at some later instant.
- After Event1, no other events can happen → once Event1 occurs, there are no further event occurrences.

Trace the timeline and evaluate C1 at each instant:
- At the initial instant: Event2 is true, Event1 is false ⇒ C1 is false.
- At the instant Event1 occurs: Event1 is true, Event2 is not occurring at that same instant ⇒ C1 is false.
- After Event1: no events occur, so neither Event1 nor Event2 holds ⇒ C1 is false.

Therefore C1 is false at every time instant, so C2 (always C1) is false, and consequently C3 (eventually C2) is false.

Final answer: False

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

1) What is being asked: Determine truth of C3 given the context and C1–C2.

2) Understand the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 occurs, event2 will occur later).

3) Examine the hypotheses:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (p → p); it is true at any time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true right away (it holds at every moment), C1 does indeed eventually hold, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This claims C2 is false, but we just determined C2 is true.

4) Conclusion: C3 is false.

False
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
- C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide if that statement is true or false.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true at any point (and in particular true in the initial state where event2 happened).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately (everywhere), C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we just established C2 holds, so C3 is false.

Conclusion
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1. What is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false, given the context and the other statements.

2. Understand each condition
- Context rules force an infinite alternation: initially event2 has happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So event2, event1, event2, event1, ... occurs (event2 occurs now and repeatedly later).
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a plain implication p → p. That is a tautology (it holds in any state regardless of whether event2 actually happens).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true at every moment (including the initial moment), C1 holds immediately, so C1 certainly holds at some future time — hence C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts the conclusion above that C2 is true.

3. Conclusion
- Since C2 is true, the statement C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

Step 1 — what is asked:
C3 is the statement ""C2 eventually holds"". We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions and context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur in any later state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur before event2).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (it already holds now).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds in the current state, it certainly holds at some (immediate) future point — so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur in any subsequent state).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur; event2 already occurred initially).
- Conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. event2 does not happen in the next state).
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some time in the future, C2 is true).

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
- Since event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, no events (including event2) occur in the next state. Thus C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true already at the initial state.
- C3 asks whether C2 holds at some point in the future. C2 already holds now (and also holds in the next state), so the eventuality is satisfied.

Note on semantics: whether ""eventually"" allows the current state or only strict future doesn't change the outcome here — C2 holds now and in all subsequent states, so C3 holds either way.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in all states following the initial one, no events occur).
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 did not occur.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At the initial state, the next state exists (or if it doesn't, X-formulas are false); since after event2 no events occur, event2 does not occur in the next state. So C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true already at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds right now (at the initial state), it certainly holds at some future time (immediately), so C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answering the hypothesis: C3 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C3 says C1 and C2 both hold; C1 and C2 each assert: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- From the context we have:
  - Initially, event2 happened (so there is at least one occurrence of event2).
  - If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (event1 -> event2).
  - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- The context gives event1 -> event2, but does not give the converse event2 -> event1. In particular, since event2 happens initially and no events can occur after it, there is no requirement (and no evidence) that event1 happened before that event2.
- Therefore C1 (and thus C2) is not entailed by the context, so C3 (C1 and C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 asserts C1 and C2 both hold.
- C1 and C2 are identical: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 did occur.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 ⇒ event2.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 occurs, nothing else can occur afterward.)

Step 3 — reason about the implication ""event2 ⇒ event1"":
- We have an actual occurrence of event2 (initially), but nothing in the context requires that event1 occurred before that. In fact, because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" event1 cannot occur after this event2; so if event1 were to hold it would have to have happened before event2, but the context does not state that.
- The context allows the situation where event2 occurs without event1 having occurred. That is a counterexample to the implication ""if event2 then event1.""

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Therefore C1 is false (and so is C2). Their conjunction C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C3 asserts: C1 holds AND C2 holds.
- C1 and C2 are the same statement: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" (event2 → event1).
- So C3 is true exactly when the implication event2 → event1 is entailed by the context.

Step 2 — Examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So a model with event2 and no prior events is allowed.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → later event2; this does not force event1 to occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal; nothing can occur after it.)

Step 3 — Reason about possible sequences
- Consider the timeline where initially event2 happens and event1 never occurs (no prior event1). This satisfies:
  - ""Initially, event2 happened.""
  - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" (vacuously true because event1 did not occur).
  - ""After event2, no other events can happen"" (true because event2 is terminal).
- In that allowed model event2 occurs but event1 does not, so event2 → event1 is false in that model.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- Since the context permits a model where event2 occurs without event1, the implication event2 → event1 is not entailed.
- Therefore C1 is false (and so is C2), hence C3 (""C1 holds and C2 holds"") is false.

- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences:

- Therefore there is no state where both event1 and event2 happen (C1 is false in every relevant state).
- If C1 is false, then C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false in every state.
- If C2 is false somewhere (indeed everywhere), then C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
C3 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 requires both event1 and event2 to happen.
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore once event1 has happened, event2 cannot occur at any later time, and there is no way event2 happened before the initial state.
- So C1 is false in every state (event2 never happens).
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false, and therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
---
We are asked whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Interpretation and stepwise reasoning:
1. C1 = ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This requires both events to have occurred (at some time).
   - Event2 could not occur after event1 because the context says ""after event1, no other events can happen.""
   - The only way C1 could be true is if event2 also happened at the initial moment (simultaneously with event1). That is not ruled out by the statements, so C1 might be true in some models but is not guaranteed.
2. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state."" For C2 to be true in a state, there must be a next state in which C1 holds.
   - From the initial state (where event1 happened), no other events can happen, so there is no transition to a next state (or, equivalently, the next-state property cannot be satisfied).
   - Therefore C2 is false at the initial state (even if both events happened initially, C1 does not hold ""in the next state"" because there is no next state where it could hold).
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., C2 holds in all states).
   - Because C2 is false at the initial state, C3 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every state/path, event1 eventually happens).
- C3: C2 does not hold. We must decide whether C3 is true or false.

2. Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred in the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus once event1 has occurred the system halts (no further events).
- (Also: after event2, no other events can happen — irrelevant because event2 does not occur given the previous facts.)

3. Evaluate C1:
- Since event1 already happened initially, ""event1 eventually happens"" is true.

4. Evaluate C2:
- C2 requires that C1 holds in all states/paths. But there is only the initial/post-event1 state (no further events or alternative branches), and in that state event1 has happened. Therefore C1 holds everywhere; C2 is true.

5. Evaluate C3:
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. But we just concluded C2 does hold. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---

---
Step 1 — identify the question:
C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 fails given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial moment event1 has occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has occurred, there are no future events (so event1 cannot occur again later).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the first two facts.)

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true in the initial state because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This requires that in every state along every possible execution, C1 is true (i.e., from every state, event1 will eventually happen in the future).
  But consider the state after event1 (which is the initial state or its immediate successor): since after event1 no events can happen, event1 will not occur again in the future from that state. Therefore from that state C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.
  Hence C2 is false (it does not hold in all states).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since we just showed C2 is false, C3 is true.

Goal: decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true.

Short summary of reasoning (no step-by-step chain-of-thought):

- Context facts:
  - Initially event1 occurred.
  - Once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.
  - The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.

- Consequence: because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur at any future time. Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false. That makes C2 (C1 in the next state) false as well. Since event2 does not happen and C2 is false, C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the context says
- Initially event1 has already happened.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur in any future state.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” imposes a requirement if event2 occurs, but it doesn't override the previous rule that event2 cannot occur after event1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot happen in any future state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" If C1 is false now (and event2 can never occur), it is false in the next state as well. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This conjunct requires C2 to be true and event2 to occur. Both are false (C2 is false, event2 cannot happen), so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We must decide whether that combined statement can be true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no future event can occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after that, event2 cannot happen at any later time. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false in the current timeline, it is also false in the next state (no events can occur there either). So C2 is false.
- ""event2 happens"": As already noted, event2 cannot happen after the initial event1, so this is false as well.

Step 4 — combine for C3
C3 requires both C2 to hold and event2 to happen. Both conjuncts are false, so C3 is false.

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event1 occurs). After event1, event2 must happen (so the state after that will have event2).
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, this is false (the next state must have event1, not event2).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" We have C2 true, and according to the context event1 indeed happens in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C3 is True.

Identify the question:
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens.""

Trace the events from the context:
- Initially event2 happened (call this state S0).
- The context says: after event2, event1 must happen. So in the next state S1, event1 occurs.
- Also, after event1, event2 must happen later (in S2), but that does not affect S1.

Evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- C1 is false: event2 does not happen in the next state S1 (event1 does).
- Therefore C2 is true (since C1 does not hold).
- Event1 does happen in the next state S1, so the second part of C3 is true.
- Both parts of C3 are true, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- It asks whether C3 is true given the context.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 ↔ (Event2 does not happen in the next state).  
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" So C3 ↔ (Event2 does not happen in the next state) AND (Event1 happens).

Trace the event sequence from the context:
- Initially event2 happened (call that state S0).
- The context says: after event2, event1 must happen. So in the next state S1, event1 must occur. Therefore event2 does not occur in S1.
- Also, after event1, event2 must happen (so in S2 event2 will occur), but that affects S2, not S1.

Evaluate the conditions in S1 (the ""next state"" after the initial event2):
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C2 is true (since C1 does not hold).
- Event1 does happen in the next state, so the second part of C3 is true.

Therefore C3 (C2 holds and event1 happens) is true.

Final answer:
True"

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true.
2. Context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no other events can happen — in particular, event2 does not occur.
3. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P -> P), so C1 is true regardless of whether event2 actually happens.
4. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 is true (from context) and C1 is true, so C2 is true.
5. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 holds, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify question:
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and C1–C2.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (p → p). That is a logical tautology, so C1 is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.

Step 3 — examine C2:
- C2 is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so event1 does happen.
- From Step 2, C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 holds (true).

Step 4 — examine C3:
- C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold.""
- But from Step 3, C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must evaluate whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (so event2 cannot happen later). After event2 no other events can happen (irrelevant since event2 does not occur).
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication of a proposition to itself) and therefore true regardless of whether event2 actually happens.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen (given), and C1 holds (tautology), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2; since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is essentially ""event1 happens"" (the repetition is redundant).
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" means ""event1 holds in every state.""
- From the context, the events must alternate and the initial state has event2. A possible infinite trace: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...
- Event1 does not hold in every state (it fails at s0, s2, ...), so C2 is false.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., from s1 onward event1 always holds). But from s1 there will be s2 with event2, so C2 still fails at s1.
Therefore C3 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalently, Event1 holds (the conjunction is redundant).
   - C2 = ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. Event1 holds in every state.
   - C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at the next state, Event1 holds in every state from there on.

2. Use the context rules to build the trace:
   - Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen, so s1 has event1.
   - After event1, event2 must happen, so s2 has event2.
   - The sequence alternates: s0:event2, s1:event1, s2:event2, s3:event1, ...

3. Evaluate C2 and C3:
   - C2 (""Event1 always holds"") is false because s0 has event2 (not event1), and in fact every even-index state has event2.
   - C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state (i.e. at s1). From s1 the future still alternates (s2 has event2), so C2 is false at s1 as well.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpret the context as a transition system:
   - s0 (initial): event2 holds.
   - Rule: after event2, event1 must hold in the next state.
   - Rule: after event1, event2 must hold in the next state.
   So the states must alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

2. Simplify the hypothesis formulas:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" = ""always event1"" (globally event1).
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = ""in the next state, always event1"".

3. Evaluate C2 and C3 in the model:
   - C2 is false at s0 because s0 has event2, so event1 is not true in all states.
   - C3 asserts that from s1 onward event1 holds in every future state. But s2 is event2, so ""always event1"" is false at s1. Therefore C3 is false.

Thus C3 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true given the scenario.

Interpretation of the context:
- Initially event1 has happened (so at the initial state, event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at some later point event2 occurs).
- After event2, no further events occur (so in all states after event2, no new events will happen).

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true in the initial state because event1 already happened there.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., at every state, event1 will eventually happen in the future from that state. This fails: take a state after event2 (or the state where event2 just occurred and no more events can happen). From that state, event1 will not occur in the future, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is false there. Hence C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this asserts that C2 is true when evaluated at the state immediately following the initial state. But as just argued, C2 is false in states after event1/event2, so C2 does not hold in the next state.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
C3 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The system trace is: at the initial state event1 occurs; then event2 must occur; after event2 nothing else can occur. So the only events are event1 (initial), then event2, then stop.

- C1 (""event1 eventually happens""): true at the initial state because event1 already happened.

- C2 (""C1 always holds""): this requires that at every state along the trace, C1 is true. Consider the state immediately after the initial state (the ""next"" state): from that state, event1 will not occur in the future (event1 happened only initially), so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 is false (it does not hold in all states).

- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): since C2 is already false (and in particular C2 does not hold in the next state), C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C3 says
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So we must check whether, in the state immediately after the initial state, C2 is true.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1). At the initial state this is true because event1 already happened initially.
- From the context: after the initial state, event2 must happen next, and after event2 no more events happen. So event1 does not occur again after the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 at the next state
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1) — i.e. at every state from the point of evaluation, C1 is true.
- At the next state (where event2 happens), C1 (F event1) is false because event1 will not happen in the future from that point.
- Therefore C2 is false in the next state.

Conclusion
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the event rules.

Step 2 — understand the event rules and trace states
- Initially (state S0): event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → S1: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → S2: event1.
Thus the system alternates: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, ...

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., holds at every state). This is false because at S1 (and every odd state) event1 does not hold.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at the current state, in the next state C1 is true). At S0, the next state S1 does not satisfy C1 (S1 has event2 but not event1 always), so C2 is false at S0. In fact, because of the alternation, at every state the next state will contain a time where event1 is false, so C2 is false at every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" requires C2 to be true at every state. But C2 is false (already false at S0 and in general), so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the immediately following state, event1 always happens)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e., in every state, C2 is true)

We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the system behavior
- Initially event1 happens.
- After any event1, event2 must happen next.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next.
So the events alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... forever.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 claims event1 holds in every state. But the sequence contains states where event2 holds (every other state). Therefore C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 says that in the next state, C1 holds. The next state (immediately after the initial state) is a state where event2 holds, so C1 (that event1 holds in every state from that point) is false there. Therefore C2 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C3
- C3 requires that C2 holds in every state. C2 is already false (it does not hold in the next state), so C3 cannot be true.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the context as a timeline of states: t0, t1, t2, ... with
   - t0: event1 happened (given),
   - after event1 must come event2, so t1: event2,
   - after event2 must come event1, so t2: event1,
   - and so on (events alternate: event1 at even times, event2 at odd times).

2. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") means event1 holds at every state. That is false in this model because at t1 (and every odd time) event1 does not hold (event2 holds instead). So C1 is false.

3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is the claim that at the next state C1 is true. At t0, the next state is t1, but C1 is false at t1 (as shown), so C2 is false at t0.

4. C3 (""C2 always holds"") would require C2 to be true at every state. Since C2 is already false at t0, C3 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C3 is False."

- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds.
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur in the next state after event1).
- (The ""after event2..."" clause is irrelevant because event2 does not happen.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- Since event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 says: if event1 happens then C1. But event1 does happen, and C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C3:
- C3 = (C2 holds) AND (event1 happens). C2 is false, event1 does happen, but the conjunction is false.

Final answer:

---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts: (C2 holds) AND (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context gives: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (so in the next state after event1, no events occur). Also after event2 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" event1 does happen (given), but C1 is false, so the implication (true antecedent, false consequent) makes C2 false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 = (C2 holds) AND (event1 happens). We have event1 happens = true, but C2 = false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So ""event1 happens"" is true in the initial state.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, no further events — including event2 — can occur thereafter.)

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given that event1 has happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" The antecedent (""event1 happens"") is true (initially event1 happened), but the consequent (C1) is false. A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the conditional false. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" This is a conjunction of C2 (false) and ""event1 happens"" (true). A conjunction with one false conjunct is false.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This claims C2 is false.

- The context states event2 happened initially. That makes the antecedent of C2 true. But even without that, C2's consequent C1 is always true, so C2 is true in any case.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context and the other claims.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (a material implication with identical antecedent and consequent) and is therefore always true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, the implication of C2 is true regardless of whether event2 happens. In particular, event2 did happen initially, and C1 is true, so C2 holds.
- Context facts (for completeness): event2 happened initially; after event2 no other events can happen (so event1 does not occur after event2). This does not affect the truth of C1 (still true) or C2 (still true).

Step 3 — conclusion about C3
- C3 claims that C2 does not hold, but we have shown C2 does hold. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: If event1 happens, then event1 happens. (A trivial/self-referential implication.)
   - C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds.
   - C3: C2 does not hold.
   The question asks whether C3 is True or False.

2. Examine C1:
   - C1 is a tautology (p → p). It is always true whenever we evaluate it.

3. Examine C2:
   - C2 is ""event2 → C1"". Since C1 is true in all cases, the implication event2 → C1 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent). Therefore C2 holds.

   - Also, the context states event2 happened initially, so the antecedent of C2 is true and C1 is true; that also makes C2 true.

4. Examine C3:
   - C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. But we have established C2 does hold. Hence C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., ¬C1)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e., ¬C1 always)

Step 2 — Use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. That makes C1 true (since event2 happens).
- Since C1 is true, C2 (the statement ""C1 does not hold"") is false at least initially.

Step 3 — Evaluate C3:
- C3 asserts that C2 always holds. But C2 is false (we just showed it does not hold initially), so C2 cannot always hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step:

1. Initially event2 happened. So at that time event2 happens.
2. C1 = ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — therefore C1 is true (because event2 happened).
3. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" — so C2 is false (since C1 is true).
4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is false at the initial moment, C3 cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what's asked:
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

So both event2 and event1 do happen (event2 initially, then event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — this is true (both happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — this is false (since C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — false, because C2 is already false at the initial time.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e. in every state, C2 is true). We must decide whether that temporal formula is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from the point event1 has occurred, all future states have no events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (this is irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — examine C1, C2
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" At the initial state event1 does happen, and no event2 ever occurs afterward, so C1 is false at the initial state (antecedent true, consequent false).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state(s) after the initial one have no events (by the context). In any such future state event1 does not happen there, so the implication in C1 (if event1 happens then event2 happens) is vacuously true in those states. Therefore C1 is true in every next state, so C2 is true at the initial state.
- For any later state with no events, the next state also has no events, so the same vacuous truth argument shows C1 holds in that next state. Thus C2 is true at every state in the run.

Step 4 — conclusion about C3
- Because C2 holds at every state, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the claim ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., C2 is true at every state).

Examine each condition:
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the states alternate: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, ...
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is evaluated relative to a state: at a state s, C1 is true iff the next state contains event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" At a state s, C2 is true if either (a) event2 occurs in s's next state, or (b) event1 occurs in s itself.

Trace the sequence and evaluate C2 at each state:
- S0 (initial): event1 happened. The next state S1 has event2, so C1 is true at S0; thus C2 is true at S0.
- S1: event2 happened. The next state S2 has event1, so C1 is false at S1 (the next state does not have event2). Also event1 does not happen in S1 (S1 has event2), so the second disjunct is false. Therefore C2 is false at S1.
- Since C2 is already false at S1, it is not true at all states; hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Interpretation:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens (in the current state).""
- C3: ""C2 holds in every state.""

Trace the execution starting from the initial condition:
- State0: event1 happened. By the rules, state1 will have event2. So at state0: C1 is true (next state has event2), and event1 is true; hence C2 is true.
- State1: event2 happened. By the rules, state2 will have event1. So at state1: C1 is false (next state does not have event2), and event1 is false in the current state; hence C2 is false.

Because C2 is false at state1, C2 does not hold in every state. Therefore C3 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C3 says ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, C2 is true).

Step 2 — understand C2:
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"".
- C1 is ""event2 happens in the next state"".

Step 3 — trace the sequence from the context:
- t0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By the rules, events alternate: t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, …

Step 4 — evaluate C2 along the trace:
- At t0 (event1): C1 is true (next state t1 has event2), and event1 is true, so C2 is true.
- At t1 (event2): C1 is false (next state t2 has event1, so event2 does not happen next), and event1 is false (current state is event2). Thus C2 is false at t1.

Since C2 fails at t1, it does not hold at every state, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — requires event2 happens and event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future point C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 already holds (C1 is true initially).
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means once event2 has happened, no further events (including event1) can occur.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- C1 is true (because event2 happened initially).
- For C2 to hold we need event1 to happen as well, but event1 cannot happen after event2 (and event2 already happened initially), so event1 will never occur. Therefore C2 can never become true.
- Since C2 never holds, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant). This is true because event2 happened initially.
- C2 requires C1 and that event1 happens. That therefore requires event1 to occur at some point.
- But the context says ""after event2, no other events can happen"" and event2 happened initially, so no events (including event1) can occur thereafter. There is also no information that event1 occurred before the initial state. Thus event1 does not occur, so C2 is false.
- C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 never becomes true, C3 is false.
---
You're asking whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

Step-by-step:
- C1 is simply ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" i.e. both event2 and event1 have happened.
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" i.e. at some point both event2 and event1 have happened.

From the context:
- event2 happened initially.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterwards.
- Also, if event1 were to occur before event2, ""after event1 no other events can happen"" would prevent event2 from occurring afterwards; that would contradict the fact that event2 did happen initially.

Therefore there is no possible execution in which both event1 and event2 occur. Thus C2 can never hold, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False"

Step 1 — interpret propositions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — read as a statement about the current moment (i.e., at a given time, event2 is not happening).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — from some time onward, at every moment C1 is true (the usual temporal operator G).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists a future time from which C1 holds at every subsequent moment (the usual temporal formula F G C1).

Step 2 — apply the context
- Initially (time t0) event2 happened. So at t0, C1 is false.
- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. So at t1, t2, ... (all future moments after t0) no events happen — in particular, at those times event2 is not happening, so C1 is true at every t ≥ t1.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C3
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false at t0 (because C1 is false there), so C2 is not true now.
- However, at t1 and thereafter C1 holds at every moment, so starting at t1 the formula ""always C1"" becomes true. That means C2 becomes true at t1.
- Therefore there exists a future time (t1) at which C2 holds. So C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The question: is C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") true given the context?

2. Examine the conditions:
   - Context states: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen.
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., from some time point onward, at every future time C1 is true).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., there exists a time point after which C1 is always true).

3. Evaluate C1 and C2 over time:
   - At the initial time, event2 happened, so C1 is false there.
   - Immediately after that initial point, no further events occur. At those later times, event2 does not occur (it occurred in the past), so C1 is true at all times after the initial moment.
   - Therefore, at any time after the initial event2, C1 holds forever; hence C2 holds at those times.

4. Conclusion about C3:
   - Because there exists (indeed, immediately after the initial state) a time when C2 becomes true, C2 eventually holds.
   - Thus C3 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just ""Event1 happens."" (a tautological repetition)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" = ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens.""
- C3: ""Eventually C2 holds"" = ""Eventually both Event2 and Event1 have happened.""

Step 3 — use the context to trace events
- The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So Event2 has happened at the start.
- Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means once Event2 has occurred (and it already did initially), no further events (including Event1) can occur afterward.
- The context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" but that is irrelevant since Event1 never occurs before Event2 (we are told Event2 is the initial event).

Step 4 — conclude whether C3 can hold
- For C2 to hold we need both Event2 and Event1 to have happened. Event2 did happen, but Event1 cannot happen at any later time because Event2 already occurred and forbids any further events. There is no information that Event1 happened before Event2, and the statement that Event2 happened initially indicates Event1 did not happen beforehand.
- Therefore Event1 does not happen, so C2 never becomes true, so C3 (""eventually C2 holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify what is asked
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — we must decide whether C2 will be true at some point.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e., event1 happens).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" (i.e., both event2 and event1 happen).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point both events have happened).

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequence
- Since event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1) can occur at any time after that.
- There is no indication event1 happened before event2; the initial fact only asserts event2 happened initially.
- Therefore event1 does not occur at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims
- C1 is false (event1 does not happen).
- C2 is false (event2 happened but event1 did not, so the conjunction fails).
- Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" means both event2 and event1 happen.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means that at some point both event2 and event1 have occurred.

Step 2 — what the context says:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has already occurred at the start).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events — including event1 — can occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — combine them:
- Since event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time.
- Therefore C2 (both event2 and event1 happen) can never become true, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" The context says ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so event1 is true. Combined with C1 being true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Step 3 — event sequencing (consistency check)
- The temporal rules (event1 → event2 afterwards and event2 → event1 afterwards) and the initial event1 do not negate C2; they may imply further occurrences but do not make ""event1 happened"" false. So no contradiction arises.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (which says ""C2 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and therefore always true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" The context states ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so ""Event1 happens"" is true, and we just established C1 is true; therefore C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2.

Step 3 — Trace events (consistency check)
- From the context: event1 happened initially; after event1, event2 must happen, so event2 happens; after event2, event1 must happen, and so on. This sequence is consistent and does not invalidate C1 or C2.

Conclusion
- C2 holds, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — this would require event1 to occur (now and at all future times).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — true if either (a) event1 always happens, or (b) event1 happens (at the time considered).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future point C2 becomes true.

Step 4 — trace the possible sequence:
- At the initial point event2 already happened.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 can never occur at any future time.
- Therefore C1 (event1 always happens) is false.
- Also event1 does not happen now or ever, so the disjunction C2 is false now and will remain false.

Conclusion:
- C2 will never become true, so ""C2 eventually holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, no future events can occur).
- Also, ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after the already-occurring event2.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the initial event2 and that no events can occur afterward, event1 does not (and cannot) occur, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C1 is false and event1 never happens), so C2 is false now and will never become true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 cannot become true at any future time, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step-by-step:

1. Context facts:
   - Initially event2 happened (so at the start event2 has occurred).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so no events — in particular event1 — can occur after that initial event2).

2. Can event1 ever occur?
   - Since event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur afterward, event1 cannot occur at any time in this execution.

3. Evaluate C1:
   - C1 = ""Event1 always happens."" Because event1 never occurs here, C1 is false.

4. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 = ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C1 is false; event1 does not happen), so C2 is false at all times.

5. Evaluate C3:
   - C3 = ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 never holds, C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether the compound statement C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the background facts
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 will occur at some point after event1; therefore event2 is true.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This only restricts events after event2, no contradiction with the above.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, both event1 and event2 occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen and C1 is true, the implication is true (true antecedent and true consequent).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have just shown C2 is true and event2 happens, so C3 is true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
You ask whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (event1 is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Because event1 occurred, event2 will occur at some later point.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This only prevents events after event2; it does not prevent event2 itself.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Since event1 already happened initially and event2 must happen after event1, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is equivalent to saying event2 implies event1 (because C1 already includes event2). Event1 is already true (it happened initially), so whenever event2 happens, event1 is also true; therefore C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have just established C2 is true, and the context requires event2 to happen (because event1 happened), so event2 does happen. Thus both parts of C3 are true.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Use the context
- Initially, event1 happened. 
- After event1, event2 must happen → so event2 does happen.
- After event2 no other events can happen (irrelevant to truth of C3 here).

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, both hold, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" In the given scenario event2 does happen and C1 is true, so the implication C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both conjuncts are true, so C3 is true.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C3 says: (C2 holds) AND (event2 happens).

Step 2 — understand each condition from the context:
- Context statements:
  1. Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen (at least initially).
  2. After event2, event1 must happen. That makes event1 follow every occurrence of event2.
  3. After event1, event2 must happen. That makes event2 follow every occurrence of event1.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the same as statement 3, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The context gives a rule that after event1, event2 must happen (a persistent rule), so C1 holds universally in the described system; therefore C2 is true.
- Event2 happens: directly given by the initial condition.

Step 3 — combine for C3:
- Both conjuncts of C3 are true (C2 holds, and event2 happens), so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify what is asked:
- C3 is the conjunction: (C2 holds) AND (event2 happens). We must decide if C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Examine each condition:
- Context rules:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.)
  - After event1, event2 must happen. (So whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward.)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the third context rule, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The context expresses C1 as a rule applying whenever event1 occurs, so C1 is a general law — C2 holds.
- Event2 happens: it happened initially (and will happen repeatedly due to the alternating requirements).

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- event2 (initial) → forces event1 → forces event2 → ... so event2 does occur, and the implication from event1 to event2 is always enforced.

Conclusion:
- C2 holds and event2 happens, so C3 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
C3 asserts “C2 holds and event2 happens.” We must determine whether that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- From the context “After event1, event2 must happen,” we get C1 (“If event1 happens, then event2 happens”). So C1 follows from the context.
- C2 says C1 always holds. The context gives an unconditional rule that after any event1, event2 must happen, so C1 is indeed always true; therefore C2 holds.
- The context also states “Initially, event2 happened,” so event2 does happen (at least at that initial time).

Step 3 — combine:
C2 is true and event2 happens, so the conjunction C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e. in the next state, event1 happens in that state's next state)
- C3: ""C2 always holds.""

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (in the current state s0) event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen in any future state.
- (The clause ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 has not happened.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1: false. Because event2 already happened and the context forbids any further events, event1 cannot happen in the next state.
- C2: false. C2 would require that in the next state (s1) C1 holds there — i.e., that event1 happens in s2 — but no events can happen after event2, so event1 cannot occur in s2.
- C3: false. C3 claims C2 always holds, but C2 is already false, so C3 cannot be true.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the formulas
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e. X(event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X(C1) = X X(event1) (event1 happens two steps ahead).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. G(C2) = for every state, X X(event1) holds.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened (the initial state is a state after event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus from the initial state there is no state in which any further event occurs (no successor state with events).
- Also after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs given the initial event2 and its terminality).

Step 3 — evaluate the formulas
- At the initial state, C1 (X(event1)) is false because there is no next state where event1 happens.
- Therefore C2 (X X(event1)) is false at the initial state (there is no two-step-ahead state where event1 happens).
- Since C2 is false at the initial state, C3 = G(C2) (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning:

- Initially, event2 has happened, and the context says ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So the initial state has no successor (no next state).
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false in the initial state because there is no next state where Event1 could happen.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is therefore false in the initial state (there is no next state in which C1 could hold).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") requires C2 to be true in the initial state, but C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must determine whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred (and that fact holds from the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 is inevitable at some later point.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That only says event2 is terminal; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is a tautology equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 has already happened, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 holds (from the initial event1) and event2 is guaranteed to occur after event1, there will be a time at which event2 happens while C1 holds. Thus C2 will hold at that time.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds at the moment event2 occurs, C2 does indeed eventually hold.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C2 will hold at some point.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1). After event2, no other events can happen (but that doesn't prevent event2 itself).
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — a tautology; given the context event1 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — since C1 is true, C2 becomes true exactly when event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — asks whether event2 will occur at some point so that C2 becomes true.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
Because event1 happened initially and the context requires that after event1 event2 must happen, event2 will indeed occur. When event2 occurs, C2 is true. Therefore C2 will hold at some point.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 says ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some time in the future there will be a moment when C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" The context says ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so C1 is true from the start.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 will be true exactly when event2 happens.
- Context also states ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Because event1 happened initially, event2 is required to occur at some point. The fact that ""After event2, no other events can happen"" only says event2 is terminal; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At time 0: event1 has happened (C1 true).
- Sometime after that event2 must occur (by the given rule).
- When event2 occurs, C2 (""C1 and event2"") holds at that moment.
- Therefore C2 does occur at some time.

Conclusion:
- Since C2 does occur at some time, ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis
- C3 is ""Event2 happens or C2 holds.""

Examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies because event1 has already happened, event2 will happen at some future time (so event2 eventually happens).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ensures any event2 is followed by an event1, but this doesn't prevent event2 from occurring; it only enforces alternation.

Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" From the second rule and the initial event1, this is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 does in fact occur (by the rule), C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The question asks whether C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is true or false under the given situation.

Step 2 — restate the premises
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so an event2 occurs later).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so an event1 occurs later).
These rules allow an alternating sequence E1 (initial), E2, E1, E2, ... and do not create a contradiction.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" From the initial event1 and Rule A, an event2 must occur after that → C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 does indeed happen, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" At least one disjunct (in fact both) is true, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- The question asks whether C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is True or False given the initial facts and rules.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Rule A: after event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 happened initially, event2 must happen at some later time).
- Rule B: after event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 will occur again, and then by A event2 will occur again, etc.).

Step 3 — examine the hypotheses
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. From Rule A and the fact that event1 happened initially, event2 must indeed eventually happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens. Since C1 is true and event2 does happen (by the same reasoning), C2 is true.
- C3: Event2 happens or C2 holds. Since event2 does happen, the disjunction is true (and in fact C2 also holds).

- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur (after event2).
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen. That just ends the sequence after event1.

Thus in any allowed sequence given the context, event2 happens and then event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 does happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is False, ""C2 does not hold"" is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- Determine whether C3 is True or False.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- Context: event2 happened initially. Rule: after event2, event1 must happen. Rule: after event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (tautological repetition).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. not(C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. not(C2), which is equivalent to C1.

Step 3 — reason about events:
- Since event2 occurred initially and the rule is that after event2 event1 must happen, event1 does indeed happen (and then no further events occur).
- Therefore C1 is True, C2 is False, and C3 (which equals C1) is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 happens.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ Event1 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ not(Event1 does not happen) ≡ Event1 happens.
So C3 is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (since event2 happened initially).
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only means event1 is terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — conclude
- Event1 does happen, so C1 is true, C2 is false, and C3 is true.

- C2: C1 does not hold.
- C3: C2 does not hold.

Step 2 — examine the context against C1:
- Context says: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That directly states the implication in C1 (whenever event1 occurs, event2 follows). So C1 is true in the context.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C3:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold — since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold — since C2 is false, C3 is true.

(Also note logically: C3 = not(C2) = not(not(C1)) = C1, so C3 has the same truth value as C1.)

Final answer: True

Step 1 — Identify what's asked
- We must determine whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So whenever event1 occurs, event2 follows.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows.)

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context clause ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 holds (is true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" The question: is C3 true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C3?

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. This guarantees that whenever event1 occurs, event2 follows.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From ""Initially, event2 happened"" we know event2 occurs at the start.
2. From ""After event2, event1 must happen"" we know event1 will occur sometime after that. So event1 does happen.
3. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only restricts future events after event1 — it does not prevent event1 itself. The resulting trace is: event2 (initial), then event1, then no further events.
4. C1 (""Event1 happens or event2 happens"") is true in that trace (in fact both happen).
5. C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true for the trace: the statement ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" is true (it is a global fact about the trace), so it holds.
6. Therefore C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true.
---

---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 asserts: (Event1 happens) AND (C1 always holds).
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every moment the disjunction Event1 or Event2 holds).

Step 2 — use the context to get the event sequence
- Initially Event2 happens.
- The rule ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"" forces Event1 to occur later.
- The rule ""after Event1, no other events can happen"" just stops further events after Event1.
- So the actual sequence is: Event2 then Event1 (and then nothing).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 happens or Event2 happens"") is true for the run (both events occur at some points).
- C2 (""always C1"") asks that at every moment either Event1 or Event2 is happening. But between the two instantaneous occurrences there are moments when neither event is happening, so the disjunction does not hold at every moment. Therefore C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- C3 needs both ""Event1 happens"" (true) and ""C2 holds"" (false). Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

Step 1 — What is asked:
C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide if C3 is True or False.

Step 2 — Understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 has occurred.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 would be terminal.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Event2 does happen (initially). But because event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot also happen. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen, C2 is True (it does not require C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is True, C3 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify what's asked:
- C3 states ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide if that is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore no event can occur after event2, in particular event1 cannot occur after event2.

Step 3 — Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Since event2 happened but event1 cannot happen (because event2 already happened and blocks further events), C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Event2 does happen, so this disjunction is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C3 asserts: ""C2 does not hold.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:

- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterwards.
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but that's irrelevant since event1 never occurs.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens""): false, because event2 did happen but event1 cannot (no events can occur after event2).
- C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds""): true, because event2 does happen.

- C1 says: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — understand the context/rules:

- After event2, event1 must happen (so states alternate event1, event2, event1, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 at the initial state:
- In the initial state event1 has just happened, so by the rule the next state must be event2.
- Therefore, ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false at the initial state.

Step 4 — propagate to C2 and C3:
- C2 requires C1 to hold in every state; since C1 is false in the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3 requires C2 to hold in every state; since C2 is false (already at the initial state), C3 is false.

False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G X event1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G G X event1). Note G G P is equivalent to G P, so C3 ≡ C2.

Step 2 — understand the context constraints
- Initially (state s0): event1 holds.
- After event1, event2 must happen: whenever event1 holds at time t, event2 holds at t+1.
- After event2, event1 must happen: whenever event2 holds at t, event1 holds at t+1.

Step 3 — trace the states
- s0: event1 (given).
- s1: must be event2 (because s0 had event1).
- s2: must be event1 (because s1 had event2).
- s3: must be event2, and so on — the events alternate: e1, e2, e1, e2, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- At s0, C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false because s1 has event2.
- Therefore C2 = G X event1 is false (it requires C1 at every state).
- Hence C3 is also false (equivalent to C2).

You ask whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 happens. (Also the context says event2 did happen initially, which makes the second disjunct true as well.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (event2 → event2), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (True ∨ anything = True).
- Context also says event2 did happen initially, which independently makes the right disjunct true as well, but that is unnecessary given C1’s truth.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. But we have C2 = True, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether event2 actually happens.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts that C2 is false.

We want to know whether C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is true.

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So in the next state no events occur (event2 does not happen again, and event1 cannot occur after event2).
2. C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is therefore false.
3. C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is an implication with a false antecedent, so C2 is true (vacuously).
4. C3 is ""C2 holds or event1 happens"". Since C2 is true, the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
We are asked whether C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Because event2 already happened initially and the context says that after event2 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Since C2 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Conclusion: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, so we are in the state after event2.
- The context says after event2 no other events can happen, so event2 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 then event1"". An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true.
- Event1 does not happen (no events can occur after event2), so event1 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" = True or False = True."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is asked: Is C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") true under the given scenario?

2. Examine C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (an implication with the same antecedent and consequent). It is true in every state (true when event2 happens, and also true when it does not happen because a false antecedent makes the implication true).

3. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false in every state.

4. C3 says that C2 holds in the next state. Since C2 is false everywhere, C2 cannot hold in any next state. Also, the context states that after event2 no other events can happen (so there is no meaningful future state where the claim could become true). Either way, C3 is false.

So C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — what C3 says:
- C3 asserts ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state).

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2 in the initial state:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" is a tautology (p → p). It holds in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore false in the current state.

Step 3 — is there a next state?
- The context says initially event2 happened and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So the current state (where event2 happened) is terminal — there is no next state.

Step 4 — truth of ""holds in the next state"":
- A claim that something holds in the next state is false when there is no next state (standard temporal-semantic convention).

Conclusion:
- C2 does not hold now, and there is no next state in which C2 could hold. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (a self-implication)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of C1)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The question asks whether C3 is true.

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1 is a logical tautology (p → p). It holds in every state regardless of whether event2 actually happens.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Since C1 always holds, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false in every state.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 asserts C2 holds in the next state. Because C2 is false in every state, C2 cannot hold in the next state. (Also, given ""after event2 no other events can happen"" there may be no next state; standard ""next"" semantics then make Xφ false when no next state exists.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". Each of C1 and C2 states ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"". We must decide if C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 holds.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 will (or must) occur following that event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen. This only makes event1 terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Since event2 has already happened and event1 must follow event2, event1 will happen. Thus both event2 and event1 occur. That makes the statement ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" true. Both C1 and C2 are true (they are identical), so their disjunction C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First identify the hypothesis: C3 asserts (C1 holds) OR (C2 holds). C1 and C2 both state: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Given event2 has occurred, event1 is required to occur subsequently.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That only restricts events after event1; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Trace the sequence:
- event2 happens initially (given).
- Because of the obligation ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 does happen at some point after event2.
- That yields both event2 and event1 having happened, so C1 is true (and likewise C2, since it is identical).

Therefore C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis: C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", and C1 and C2 are both ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens"". So C3 is true exactly when Event2 happens and Event1 happens.

Step 2 — Use the context: ""Initially, event2 happened"" means Event2 does happen. ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means Event1 must occur following Event2. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only says Event1 is terminal; it does not prevent Event1 from occurring after Event2.

Step 3 — Combine: Since Event2 happens initially and Event1 must follow, both Event2 and Event1 occur in that order. That satisfies C1 (and C2).

Step 4 — Therefore C3 (C1 or C2) is satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C3 (""Event2 happens and C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 is always true whenever considered.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Since C2 is true, C3 reduces to whether Event2 happens.

Step 3 — use the context to see if Event2 happens
- Initially, event1 happened.
- The context also says: after event1, event2 must happen. Given that event1 did happen initially, event2 must (and therefore does) occur afterward.

Conclusion
- Event2 happens, and C2 holds, so C3 is true.

True
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C3 (""Event2 happens and C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P); it is always true whenever interpreted classically.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" and ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Since event1 has occurred, event2 must therefore happen (at some later time). So event2 does happen.

Putting this together: event2 happens is true, and C2 holds (true). Therefore C3 (event2 happens and C2 holds) is true.

Final answer: True
---
The hypothesis C3 asserts: (event2 happens) AND (C2, i.e. ""C1 always holds"").

- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"") is a logical tautology, so C1 holds whenever evaluated.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") therefore is true.
- From the context: event1 happened initially, and the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force event2 to occur (following the initial event1).

Thus both conjuncts of C3 are satisfied, so C3 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and the C-conditions
- Context:
  1. Initially, event1 happened.
  2. After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, the next state must have event1).
  3. After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 occurs, there are no subsequent events in later states).
- Hypothesis parts:
  - C1: Event2 happens and event1 happens (in the same state).
  - C2: C1 holds in the next state.
  - C3: Event1 happens (now) and C2 holds (in the next state).

Step 3 — reason about possible state sequences
- C3 requires that at the current state event1 happens, and in the next state both event2 and event1 happen (because C2 says C1 holds in the next state).
- But the context explicitly says: after event1, no other events can happen. That forbids any events (including event2 and event1) in the next state after a state where event1 occurs.
- Therefore, if event1 happens now, the next state cannot have event2 and event1; so C2 cannot be true in that situation.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because C3 requires a next state with events after event1, and the context forbids any events after event1, C3 cannot be satisfied.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") can be true given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 holds at the initial/current state).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means that once event1 has occurred at a state, no events occur in any subsequent state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 ever occurs.

Step 3 — examine C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — this requires event2 to happen at some state (possibly the same as event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — requires that in the next state both event2 and event1 hold.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" — requires event1 now and both event2 and event1 in the next state.

Step 4 — apply the constraints
- Because event1 already happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" forbids any events (including event2) in any future state. Thus event2 cannot occur in any later state.
- Therefore C2 (which requires event2 in the next state) cannot hold.
- If C2 cannot hold, C3 (which requires C2) cannot hold.

Final answer
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The context states:
   - Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in the current state).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so in every future state no events distinct from event1 may occur — in particular event2 cannot occur after event1).
   - (The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

2. Examine the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — this requires event2 to occur in the same state as event1.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — requires that in the next state both event2 and event1 hold.
   - C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" — requires event1 now and (in the next state) both event2 and event1.

3. Because event1 holds now and the context forbids any other events after event1, event2 cannot occur in any future state (including the next state). Therefore C2 (which requires event2 in the next state) cannot be true, so C3 (which requires C2) cannot be true.

Thus the hypothesis C3 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First, restate the hypothesis items:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens.
- C3: C2 always holds.

Examine the context rules:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- Whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen after it.
- Whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen after it.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" applies, event2 must occur at some later time. So C1 is true.
2. Given the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", whenever event2 occurs there will be a subsequent event1. Thus if C1 holds (event2 does eventually happen), event1 does happen as well. So C2 is true.
3. C2 is a logical implication that is enforced by the system rules in every execution (and in fact would be vacuously true if event2 never occurred). Therefore C2 holds in all states/executions — i.e., C2 always holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are given a system with (i) initially event1 has happened, (ii) after event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards), and (iii) after event1, event2 must happen (i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards).
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False, where
  - C1: event2 eventually happens,
  - C2: if C1 holds, then event1 happens,
  - C3: C2 always holds.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- From ""initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"", we conclude that event2 will indeed occur at some later time. So C1 is true (in every valid trace).
- Given event2 does occur, and given ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will occur (again) after that event2. Thus whenever C1 holds in the trace, event1 does happen; so C2 is true.
- Because C1 is true in the trace from the start and the rules guarantee event1 both initially and after any event2, the implication in C2 holds at all points of the trace. Therefore C2 holds always, i.e. C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — understand the setting
- Initially event1 occurs.
- Whenever event1 occurs, event2 must later occur.
- Whenever event2 occurs, event1 must later occur.
Thus from the initial event1 the obligations force an infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 2 — check C1
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True: the obligation after the initial event1 guarantees some event2 will occur (indeed infinitely many).

Step 3 — check C2
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is true, and event1 does happen (it already happened initially and will continue to happen afterwards), so C2 is true.

Step 4 — check C3
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because the obligations produce an infinite alternation, at every point in the execution there will be (again) a future event2 and a future event1; hence the implication in C2 holds at all times. Therefore C3 is true.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C3 asserts ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Each of C1 and C2 says ""Event2 always happens."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 occurred, event2 is inevitable).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal but does not prevent it from occurring).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
Because event1 did happen initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" applies, event2 must occur in every allowed sequence. Thus the statement ""Event2 always happens"" is true. Both C1 and C2 are true (they are the same claim).

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from the given initial condition, event2 necessarily occurs at some point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal, but that does not prevent event2 itself).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
Both C1 and C2 assert the same thing: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the context (event1 initially happened and event1 forces event2), event2 does indeed occur in every allowed evolution. So C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
C3 = C1 or C2. Since at least one (in fact both) of C1 and C2 is true, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the statement ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context

- After event1, event2 must happen. (So given the initial event1, event2 inevitably occurs in every continuation.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal.)

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given that event1 happened initially and that after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does indeed occur in every possible future. So C1 is true.
- C2 is the same statement as C1, so C2 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" With C1 true (and C2 true), the disjunction is true.

C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". C1 and C2 are both ""Event1 eventually happens"", so C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens"".

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 has already happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs, the future is event-free).
- Also, if event1 happens then event2 must happen afterward.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
Because event2 has already happened initially and it forbids any events afterward, no event1 can occur at any time after the initial moment. There is no ""before"" the initial state in this formulation, so event1 cannot have already occurred. Moreover, even if one tried to have event1 occur, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" would require event2 to occur after event1 — but no events can occur after the already-occurring initial event2, so that would be impossible.

Therefore event1 cannot eventually happen.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — What is asked
C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". Both C1 and C2 assert the same thing: ""Event1 eventually happens."" So C3 is true exactly when Event1 eventually happens.

Step 2 — What the context implies
- Initially, Event2 has occurred.
- After Event2 occurs, no further events can occur.
- If Event1 occurs, then Event2 must (later) occur.

Step 3 — Reasoning about possible sequences
- Event2 already occurred at the initial point. Because ""after Event2 no other events can happen,"" no events can occur after the initial point.
- Therefore Event1 cannot occur after the initial point.
- Could Event1 have occurred before Event2? The context states Event2 happened initially (we start with Event2); there is no information that Event1 has already happened. Given the model starts with Event2 and no prior events are available, Event1 does not occur.
- Also, the rule ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"" does not enable Event1 to occur (it only constrains what must follow if Event1 occurs); it does not force Event1 to have occurred before the initial Event2.

Step 4 — Conclusion
Event1 does not eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 is false, hence their disjunction C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3 = ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" which is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur after that initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 would require a later event2).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Since event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur after the initial moment.
- There is no information that event1 happened before or at the initial moment; only event2 is said to have happened initially.
- Because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2, ""event1 eventually happens"" is not satisfied.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, C2 is false, therefore C3 (""C1 or C2"") is false.

First, the hypothesis asks whether C3 is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterward.)
- Also ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never gets the chance to occur.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false because event1 already happened and that prevents any other events, so event2 cannot always (or ever) happen.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false now and there are no further events after event1, C1 does not hold in any next state either—C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both conjuncts are false (C2 is false, and event2 does not happen), so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is being asked
- C3 asserts: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We must determine if that statement can be true given the context.

2. Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

3. Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the system starts with event1 and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at all. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (because event1 is terminal). Under standard semantics, a ""next"" formula in a terminal state is not true; in any case, C1 is false in the current and cannot be made true in a non-existent next state, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Since C2 is false and event2 does not happen, the conjunction is false.

4. Conclusion
- C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
C3 asserts: (C2 holds) AND (event2 happens). We must decide if C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system is terminal after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false because the initial event1 occurs and after event1 no further events can occur, so event2 cannot occur (so it certainly does not always happen).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (since after event1 no events can happen), so C1 cannot hold in a next state; C2 is false.
- Event2 happens: false (as noted, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
C3 requires both C2 true and event2 happening. Both parts are false, so C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, C2 is true).
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
- C1 says: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

So C3 requires that in every state the next state satisfies ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both).

Step 2 — interpret the context / timeline
- Initially (state S0) event2 happened.
- By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state (S1) has event1.
- By ""after event1, no other events can happen"", there are no further events after S1.

Step 3 — check C1/C2 at S0 and S1
- In S1, event1 happens but event2 does not (event2 happened already in S0, it does not reoccur in S1). So C1 (""event2 and event1 happen"") is false in S1.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false in S0 (because the next state S1 does not satisfy C1).
- Since there exists at least one state (S0) where C2 is false, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.

Final answer: False
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 says ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. in every state, C2 is true.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state.""
- C1 says ""event2 happens and event1 happens.""

Examine the context and the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state only event2 has occurred).
- After event2, event1 must happen (this guarantees event1 will occur sometime after event2, but not necessarily immediately in the very next state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Trace a possible timeline consistent with the context:
- State 0 (initial): event2 has happened, event1 has not yet happened → C1 is false in state 0.
- State 1: nothing has happened yet (waiting to satisfy ""event1 must happen"") → C1 is still false in state 1.
- State 2: event1 happens, so from now on both event2 and event1 have occurred → C1 becomes true in state 2, and then no more events occur.

Check C2 and C3:
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false in state 0, because in the next state (state 1) C1 does not hold.
- Since C2 is not even true now (not true in state 0), it cannot be true in every state. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds."" C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 says: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true, event1 not yet).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in a later state, e.g. the next state, event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the state with event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2 against the sequence
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to hold at the same state. Given the context they occur in sequence (event2 in the initial state, event1 in a later/next state), there is no single state where both occur simultaneously. So C1 is false in the initial state and also false in the next (event1) state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false wherever we evaluate it: from the initial state the next state has event1 but not event2, so C1 does not hold in that next state.

Step 4 — conclusion about C3
- Since C2 is not true (it fails in the initial step), C2 is not ""always"" true. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 says: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- So C3 is asking whether, one step from the current state, it is true that (in the following state) event2 will eventually occur.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once we are in the initial state (where event1 has happened), no subsequent events can ever occur.
- The clause about ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens""): false, because after the initial event1 no further events are possible, so event2 cannot occur now or in the future.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): since there is no possible next state with events (event2 cannot occur later), C1 is not true in any successor state; thus C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): similarly, C2 is false in every reachable next state, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context: Initially event1 has happened. Also, ""after event1, no other events can happen"" (and similarly after event2 no further events can happen).
- From ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and the fact that event1 already happened initially, no future event can occur. In particular, event2 cannot occur at any future time.
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because C1 is false in every future state.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is also false for the same reason.

Thus C3 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen, so the system has no future where event2 can occur. Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state; but there is no next state (no events can happen after event1), so C2 is false.
- C3 says C2 holds in the next state; since C2 is already false (and there is no next state), C3 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the pieces

- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened.
  - After event1, no other events can happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.

- Hypothesis:
  - C1: event1 happens and event2 happens.
  - C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e. in the state immediately after the current one, both event1 and event2 happen).
  - C3: If event1 happens, then C2 holds.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context, event1 has happened in the initial state.
2. The context ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means that once event1 occurs, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur in the following state(s).
3. C2 requires that in the next state both event1 and event2 happen. But because no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur in the next state; therefore C2 is false in the actual (initial) situation.
4. C3 is the conditional ""if event1 happens, then C2 holds."" In the actual situation event1 does happen, but C2 is false, so the implication is false (true antecedent, false consequent).

Conclusion: False

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The context says initially event1 happened. Also, ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and likewise ""after event2, no other events can happen.""
- C1 claims ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the two ""after"" restrictions, both cannot occur at different times: if event1 happens first then no other event (including event2) can happen afterwards; if event2 happens first then no other event (including event1) can happen afterwards. So there is no way for both to occur sequentially.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state after the current one, both events happen). But if event1 happens now, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any events in the following state, so C1 cannot hold in the next state; hence C2 is false in that situation.
- C3 is the implication ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" We have a concrete situation (initial state) where event1 does happen but C2 does not hold, so the implication is false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"") is true given the three context facts.

Step 2 — restate the context and the conditions
- Context:
  1. Initially, event1 happened.
  2. After event1, no other events can happen.
  3. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state both event1 and event2 happen).
- C3: if event1 happens, then C2 holds.

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- Because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" once event1 has occurred there cannot be any further occurrence of event2 in any later state.
- C2 requires that in the next state both event1 and event2 occur. That demands event2 occur after event1.
- But that is ruled out by the context (after event1 no other events can happen), so C2 is false in any state that follows an occurrence of event1.
- Therefore there is at least one state where event1 happens (initial state) but C2 does not hold in the next state. That makes the implication in C3 false.

False"

Step 1 — what is asked
- The question asks whether C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no event (including event1) can occur afterward.
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen (but that is irrelevant if event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This is a conjunction of ""event1 happens"" and ""event1 does not happen"" — impossible. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C2 is false; event1 does not happen), so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (which is ""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the setup and each condition
- Given: initially event2 happened.
- Given: after event2, no other events can happen. Therefore, once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen at any later time.
- Given: after event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant since event1 never occurs here).

Now the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event2 already happened and prevents any further events, event1 indeed does not happen. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event1 to happen and also C1 (that event1 does not happen) to hold — a contradiction. Also we already know event1 does not happen, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C2 is False, and event1 does not happen), so C3 is False.

Sample responses:
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The question asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") exactly matches ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — so C1 holds.
- Given ""Initially, event1 happened"" and C1, event2 will (must) occur; therefore C2 (""event2 happens and C1 holds"") does become true at some time.
- But C3 requires C2 to hold at all times. Right after the initial moment (when event1 has happened but before event2 has occurred), C1 holds but event2 has not yet happened, so C2 is false at that time.
- Therefore C2 does not hold at all times, so C3 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" We must determine whether that is guaranteed by the context.

Step 2 — check each condition against the context:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""): This matches the context and therefore holds.
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds""): C1 holds, and given event1 happened and the rule, event2 will happen (at some later point), so C2 becomes true once event2 has occurred.

Step 3 — reason about ""always"":
- ""Always"" means C2 must hold at every time/state. Immediately after the initial state (where event1 has happened) there can be a moment before event2 has occurred; at that moment C1 holds but event2 has not yet happened, so C2 does not hold. Only after event2 occurs does C2 become true.
- Therefore C2 is not true at all times (it becomes true only from the time event2 occurs onward).

Conclusion:
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is not guaranteed by the context.

False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide if that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- Context: After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point after event1).
- Context: After event2 no other events can happen (event2 leads to a terminal state).
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context and is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This is the conjunction: (event2 occurs) AND (C1 true).

Step 3 — trace the timeline
- At the initial moment: event1 has happened (by assumption). C1 is true, but event2 has not necessarily happened yet — it is only guaranteed to happen sometime after event1.
- Therefore at the initial moment C2 is false (because its first conjunct, ""Event2 happens,"" is not yet satisfied).
- Eventually event2 does happen (by the ""after event1, event2 must happen"" rule), and after that moment C2 becomes true. After event2 no further events occur, so C2 continues to hold after event2.

Step 4 — evaluate ""C2 always holds""
- ""Always holds"" means C2 is true at every time/state. But C2 is false at the initial moment (before event2 occurs). So C2 is not true at all times.

Conclusion
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
C3 asserts ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must decide if that is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial state event1 has occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus once event1 has occurred (as it has initially), no future events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (see previous point).

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" C1 holds, but event2 does not and cannot happen (because event1 already occurred and prevents further events). Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false, it cannot hold in the next state.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, the proposition C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") should be true.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- From the context: initially event1 happened. So C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true right away.
- The context also says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur now or in any future state.
- There is no information that event2 ever happens; indeed the rule forbids any event after event1.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and then C3
- C2 requires event2 happens and C1 holds. C1 does hold, but event2 does not (and cannot) happen. Therefore C2 is false in the current state.
- In the next state no events can happen either (because event1 already happened), so C2 cannot hold in the next state either. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 occurs at the start and the system is terminal (no further events ever occur).
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True — it already happened initially.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to occur. But because event1 has already happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time. So C2 is false in the current (and every) state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false (there is no way for event2 to happen), C2 is false in the next state as well, so C3 is false.

- By the rule, after event2, event1 must happen, so in State1 event1 occurs. Thus C1 is true in State0.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so in State2 no events occur. In particular, from State1 the next state (State2) does not have event1, so C1 is false in State1.
- Because C1 fails in State1, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is the implication C2 → (event1 happens).
- Since C2 is false, the implication C2 → ... is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions using the context:
- Context: initially event2 happened (call that state s0). After event2, event1 must happen, so in the next state s1 event1 occurs. After event1, no other events can happen (s1 is terminal).
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state""): true at s0 (because event1 must follow event2). It is false at s1 (there is no next event).
- C2 (""C1 always holds""): false, because C1 does not hold at s1.

Step 3 — evaluate C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens""):
- C2 is false in the model, so the implication C2 → (event1 happens) is vacuously true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We need to evaluate C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — understand each condition:
- C1: ""event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. event1 does not happen in the next state).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 does not happen in the next state, but event1 does happen somewhere).

Step 3 — apply the context constraints:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur in the next state (or at any later time).

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- C2 is true (C1 does not hold).
- But event1 never happens, so the conjunct ""event1 happens"" in C3 is false.

Therefore C3 (C2 holds and event1 happens) is False. 

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 has occurred).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then a later event2 must occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine each component
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given that event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" This requires both C2 true and event1 happening. Although C2 is true, event1 does not happen (see C1), so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- The context states that after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore no events (including event1) can occur in the next state.
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") requires event1 to happen, but it does not. Hence C3 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context gives: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" so C1 is true under the context.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 holds, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" We already have C2 true; so C3 is true exactly when event1 happens.

Step 3 — does event1 happen?
The context states that initially event2 happened and that after event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does occur (it is required to happen after the initial event2).

Conclusion:
C2 holds and event1 happens, so C3 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C3 is True or False.

1) From the premises: initially event2 happened; ""after event2, event1 must happen"" means event1 does occur; ""after event1, event2 must happen"" means whenever event1 occurs, event2 will follow.

2) C1 (""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"") follows directly from ""after event1, event2 must happen"" — so C1 is True.

3) C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is True because C1 is True (an or is true if one disjunct is true).

4) Event1 does happen (because event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen), so event1 is True.

5) C3 is ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" — both conjuncts are True, so C3 is True.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- We must evaluate C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (at some time after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen. So whenever event1 happens, event2 follows.

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition:
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""): This is exactly stated by the context (""after event1, event2 must happen""), so C1 is true.
- C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens""): Since C1 is true (and also event1 happens), the disjunction C2 is true.
- C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens""): We have shown C2 is true and the context ensures event1 happens, so the conjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C3 states ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is not true in all states). We must decide whether C3 is true.

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs (which it does initially), there can be no subsequent events (including event1 again or event2).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Starting from the initial state (where event1 already happened), the next state has no events; thus event1 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false (at the initial state).

Step 4 — evaluate C2 and C3:
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is false in the initial state.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what hypothesis asks:
- C3 states ""C2 does not hold"" i.e. ""It is not the case that C1 always holds.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the system reaches a state with no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (this only matters in runs where event2 occurs).

Step 3 — trace/reason:
- Because event1 already happened initially, we are in a state after event1. By the third rule, no further events can occur. Thus in the immediate next state there is not an occurrence of event1 (no events happen).
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false at that initial/current state.
- Since C1 is not true at that state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Step 4 — conclusion about C3:
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. We found C2 is false, so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. in every state, event1 happens in the next state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — we must decide whether this is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the context constraints
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 occurs (as it did initially), no subsequent events can occur in any following state. In particular, the next state after the initial state cannot contain any events (so it cannot contain event1).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (it cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- At the initial state, C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state. But by the ""after event1, no other events can happen"" rule, the next state cannot have event1. So C1 is false at the initial state.
- Since C1 is false at least at the initial state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Step-by-step:

1. C1 (""event2 or event2"") is true in the initial state because event2 happened initially.
2. C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state. After event2 the next state must have event1 (and not event2), so C1 is false in the next state. Hence C2 is false.
3. C3 is ""C2 or event1 happens"" evaluated in the initial state. C2 is false there, and event1 does not happen in the initial state (it happens in the next state), so the disjunction is false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must evaluate C3 (C2 holds or event1 happens) given the scenario.

Step 2 — simplify and check each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to ""event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 happened initially ⇒ C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means ""event2 happens in the next state."" But the context says: after event2, event1 must happen, and after event1 no other events can happen. So in the next state (after the initial event2) event1 happens, not event2 ⇒ C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" is evaluated in the same (initial) state. C2 is false (see above). Event1 does not happen in the initial state (it happens only after event2) ⇒ the second disjunct is false in the initial state.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Both disjuncts of C3 are false in the initial state, so C3 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must evaluate C3 at the initial state (the usual interpretation): C3 = (C2) or (event1 happens now).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means: in the next state, Event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" means: either Event2 holds in the next state, or Event1 holds now.

Step 3 — use the scenario
- Initially Event2 happened (so C1 is true in the initial state).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen — so in the next state Event1 happens and no other events happen there (so Event2 does not hold in the next state).

Step 4 — evaluate
- C2 is false at the initial state because in the next state Event2 does not happen (Event1 happens instead).
- Event1 does not hold in the initial state (it holds in the next state).
- Therefore C3 = (C2) or (event1 now) = false or false = False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
C3 is the statement ""C2 always holds."" You want to know whether C3 is True or False given the initial constraints.

Step 2 — Understand the setup
- Initially event1 has happened.
- Rule A: After any event1, an event2 must occur sometime later.
- Rule B: After any event2, an event1 must occur sometime later.

These rules force an alternating sequence of events: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, … ad infinitum (because each event requires the other to occur later).

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant way of saying ""event2 happens (at some time)."" Given the initial event1 and Rule A, an event2 must occur after that initial event1, so C1 is true at the initial time. More generally, because of the alternation, there will always be some future event2 from any point in time, so C1 holds whenever interpreted as “there will be an event2 in the future.”
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because from every time point the alternation guarantees a future event2 (event2 recurs indefinitely), C1 is true at every time point. Thus C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 already asserts that C1 holds at every time; that property is stable under the dynamics implied by the rules, so C2 itself holds at every time. Therefore C3 is also true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- The question asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.
- C1 states ""Event2 happens"" (the repetition ""and event2 happens"" is redundant). From the context, event2 does occur (it follows the initial event1).
- C2 states ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., event2 must hold at every time point. That is false: the system alternates event1 and event2, so there are times when event1 has happened and event2 has not yet happened. Event2 does not hold at all times.
- Since C2 is false, the claim that ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is also false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C3 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. Rule: after event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. That forces an alternation: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, …
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — effectively just ""event2 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. at every point in time, event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. at every point in time, it is the case that at every point in time event2 happens (equivalently, C2 holds globally).

Step 3 — reason through the sequence
- From the context we get an alternating sequence; event2 does occur (infinitely often), but not at every moment: at times when event1 occurs, event2 does not hold simultaneously.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens"") is true at some times but not at all times.
- C2 requires event2 to hold at every time point; that is false because at times of event1, event2 is not happening.
- If C2 is false, then C3 (""always C2"") is also false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate/clarify the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred at the start).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 must occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: once event2 has occurred, no further events may occur).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the proposition ""event1 happens"" (redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — that reduces to ""event1 happens"" AND ""event1 happens"", i.e. again just ""event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. ""event1 happens always"" (C2 must hold at all relevant points).

Step 4 — reason about possible event sequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no events (including event1) can occur at any later time.
- There is no information that event1 happened before the initial event2; the timeline starts with the initial event2, so event1 cannot have occurred at any time in the allowed sequence.
- Therefore ""event1 happens"" is false in the actual possible execution(s).

Step 5 — conclude about C3
- C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"", which is false here.
- Since C2 does not hold (even once), it certainly does not ""always hold"".
- Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is asked: C3 asserts that ""C2 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" is therefore ""event1 and event1"", i.e. simply ""event1 happens.""
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" means ""event1 always happens"" (event1 holds at all times / in all states).

3. Use the context constraints:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 has already happened initially, no events can occur after that.
   - Therefore event1 cannot happen at any time (there is no time before the initial state given, and nothing can happen after the initial event2).

4. Conclusion:
   - Event1 does not happen, so C1 and C2 are false.
   - Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false.

1) Interpret the three conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (conjunct repeats the same fact).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — says ""Event1 happens"" holds at all times (i.e., event1 is true/occurs).

2) Use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Therefore, because event2 has already happened initially and is terminal, event1 cannot happen at any time (there is no opportunity for event1 to occur before or after).

3) Consequences:
- Event1 does not happen, so C1 is false and C2 is false.
- Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim
- We are asked whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 does happen in the run).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 has happened, event1 will occur subsequently).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1, when it occurs, is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as “in the given run/event sequence, event1 does happen” — the context forces event1 to occur (because event2 happened initially and that requires event1 to follow), so C1 is true under that reading.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in the run and the rules make it inevitable, C2 is also true (C1 holds).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have established C2 holds, and the context states event2 happened initially, so the conjunction is true.

Final answer: True

(Note: if one reads ""always"" in C1 as “at every moment/event” rather than “event1 does occur in the run,” the evaluation could differ; under the natural reading used above—“event1 will occur”—C3 is True.)
---
Step 1 — understand context
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible execution from the given initial situation, event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That just restates that C1 is true (i.e., the property in C1 holds).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Conjunction: C2 is true AND event2 occurs.

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequence(s)
- Given initially event2 happened, Rule A forces event1 to occur after that.
- Once event1 occurs, Rule B prevents any further events.
- There is no alternative execution in which event1 does not occur. So in all executions, event1 occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 is true (event1 occurs in every execution).
- C2 is true (C1 holds).
- event2 did happen initially, so the second conjunct of C3 is true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event2 happened (given).
2. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" means that because event2 already happened, event1 will occur in every possible continuation. So C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is true.
3. C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Since C1 is guaranteed by the rules and the initial event2, C2 holds.
4. C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have event2 (initially) and we have C2, so C3 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state, event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- Because event1 happened initially and event1 prevents any further events, event2 cannot occur at any later time. Thus C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e. event1 → eventually event2).
- Event1 does happen (initially), but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Therefore C2 is false (not vacuously true, because the antecedent is true).

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (C2 must be true at every time).
- Since C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 does not hold.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C3 says ""C2 always holds.""
- So we must decide whether C2 is true in every reachable state given the context.

Step 2 — restate conditions
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2, no other events can happen — irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen later. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event1 did happen (initially) but C1 is false, the implication is false in the actual run. So C2 is false (not merely vacuously true).

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- C3 claims C2 always holds. But C2 is already false in the initial state, so it does not always hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts that ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at all times, C2 is true).

Step 2 — examine the context and C1/C2:
- Context: Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. (Also: after event2 no other events can happen.)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given event1 has already happened and it prevents any further events, event2 cannot happen later. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 did happen, but C1 is false, so the implication (true antecedent → false consequent) is false. Thus C2 is false at the current/actual situation.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 claims C2 always holds, but C2 is already false in the actual situation. Therefore C3 is false.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The context states: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, nothing else can happen.

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the given rule that after event1 (which did happen) event2 must happen. Therefore C1 is false.

3. C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 did happen, C2 is true (true OR anything = true).

4. C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true because event1 happened, and that fact does not become false later — the disjunct ""Event1 happens"" remains satisfied. Therefore C2 holds at all times, so C3 is true.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step by step:

- From the context: initially event1 happened. Therefore “Event1 happens” is a true fact.
- The context also says that after event1, event2 must happen, so event2 does in fact happen. Thus C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since Event1 happens, C2 is true.
- C3 asserts that C2 always holds. Because C2 is already true (thanks to the fact that event1 happened) and nothing in the scenario can make the fact “event1 happened” false, C2 holds at all times in this scenario.

Therefore C3 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context says: initially event2 happened.
- C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen."" That directly contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (regardless of event1).
- C3 says ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is already false (it does not hold initially), C3 cannot be true.

Also note: because event2 happened initially and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" event1 cannot occur later, so C2 cannot be rescued by any later occurrence of event1.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The context says: initially event2 happened. So event2 does happen (at least initially).
2. C1 asserts ""event2 does not happen."" That directly contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
3. C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false regardless of event1.
4. C3 is ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false, C3 cannot be true.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" We must determine whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context: Initially, event2 happened.
- Context: After event2, no other events can happen.
- Context: After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (so C2 requires event2 not happening and event1 happening).
- C3: C2 always holds.

Step 3 — reason through events
- The context says event2 happened initially, so the statement ""event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- Because C1 is false, C2 (which requires C1) is false regardless of whether event1 happens.
- Therefore C2 does not hold, so it cannot ""always hold.""

C3 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 asserts: ""C2 holds in the next state.""
- C2 is: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""
- C1 is: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 happens).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (state S0): event2 happens.
- Rules:
  - After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 holds in some state, event2 must hold in the immediately following state).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 holds in some state, event1 must hold in the next state).
- Therefore the events alternate over states: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, ...

Step 3 — examine C1, C2, C3 in the state sequence
- C1 (event2) is true in states S0, S2, ...
- C2 = (C1 and event1) requires both event2 and event1 to hold in the same state. Because events alternate, no single state has both event2 and event1 true. Thus C2 is false in every state.
- C3 asks whether C2 holds in the next state. Since C2 never holds, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
C3 asserts: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So we must decide whether, given the context, the state immediately following the current state satisfies C2.

Step 2 — Interpret the context and constraints
- Initially (call that state s0) event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 holds at a state, event1 holds at the next state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 holds at a state, event2 holds at the next state).

From these rules the states alternate:
s0: event2
s1: event1   (because event2 at s0 forces event1 at s1)
s2: event2   (because event1 at s1 forces event2 at s2)
s3: event1
... and so on.

Step 3 — Examine C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this just means event2 holds in that state (redundant conjunction). C1 is true exactly in states where event2 holds (s0, s2, ...).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — requires both event2 and event1 to hold in the same state. But by the alternating sequence, event1 and event2 never hold simultaneously in any state. So C2 is false in every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — since C2 is false in every state, C2 is also false in the next state. Therefore C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C3 asserts: ""Eventually C2 holds"", where C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" and C1 = ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"".
We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Hence event2 cannot occur at any later time.)
- The occurrence of event1 is a fact of the timeline (it already happened).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 happens or event1 happens"") is true because event1 has happened.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false at the current time.
- Because event1 has already happened and nothing further can happen, C1 will remain true (there is no way for C1 to become false later).

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 says that eventually C2 will hold (i.e., eventually C1 will be false). But C1 stays true forever, so C2 never holds, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. From the context, event1 happened initially.
2. C1 is ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 already happened, C1 is true.
3. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — this is the negation of C1, so C2 is false (now).
4. Because no events can occur after event1, nothing can change that would make C1 false later. Thus C2 can never become true.
5. C3 asserts that C2 eventually holds. Since C2 can never hold, C3 is false.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C3 asserts ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition now
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred already.
- Context also: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Because event1 already happened, C1 is true now.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false now.

Step 3 — can C2 ever become true (i.e., does C2 eventually hold)?
C2 would require C1 to become false. But C1 is true because event1 has already occurred, and nothing can undo that; moreover, no further events can happen after event1, so the situation cannot change. Therefore C1 will remain true forever, so C2 can never hold at any future time.

We need to decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

1) Context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Also after event2 no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.

2) C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is true under the context (event2 cannot happen because event1 already occurred).

3) C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" C1 does hold, but event2 does not happen, so the implication is false (true antecedent, false consequent).

4) C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false in the given situation, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step:

1. The context says: ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So event2 cannot happen. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

2. C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 amounts to asserting ""event2 happens."" But from the context event2 does not happen, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened.
- Also: after event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds.""
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""

Step 3 — reason about event sequences
- Because event2 happens initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- Since event2 did occur but event1 does not occur, the implication C1 (""if event2 then event1"") is false in this timeline.
- Because no further events can change anything, C1 cannot become true at any future time, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.
- C3 says: if event2 happens then C2 holds. Here event2 does happen (antecedent true) but C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context implies: event2 occurs initially, and once event2 has occurred no further events can happen. So event1 never occurs (there is no time after the initial event2 when event1 could happen).

- C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") is false in this trace: event2 happened but event1 did not.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false: C1 is already false and nothing can happen later to make it true.

- C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") requires that after the (true) antecedent event2, C2 holds; but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
---
You're asking whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Restate the context briefly:
   - Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the start).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 must occur).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2. Interpret the hypotheses:
   - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e. any occurrence of event2 implies event1 occurs.)
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (at some future point C1 will be true)
   - C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" (the question: is C3 true given the context?)

3. Reasoning about truth values:
   - event2 already happened initially.
   - Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event1) can occur after that initial event2.
   - C1 requires that whenever event2 happens there is an event1. In the actual run, event2 happened but there is no event1 (and none can occur afterwards), so C1 is false in this run.
   - Since C1 is false now and no events can change that, C1 will never become true; therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
   - C3 asserts that if event2 happens then C2 holds. But event2 did happen and C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked:
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also “after event1, no other events can happen.”
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., C1 is false).
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens (C2 ∨ event2).

Step 3 — reason about event sequence:
- Since event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event1 cannot also happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 is an OR: C2 ∨ event2. Because C2 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 happened. Also, ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore no events occur in any state after the initial one. (The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never happens.)

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is false, because event1 happened initially and by the given rule no events (including event1) happen after that.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

4. C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 holds (true), so the disjunction is true regardless of event2.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether the formula C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 occurs at the initial state and that prevents any events from occurring afterward.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event1 does not (and cannot) happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. C2 is true, so C3 is true (whether or not event2 happens — and in fact event2 cannot happen after event1).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is the conjunction ""C2 holds AND event1 happens"". We must determine whether that conjunction is true.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 did occur, event1 must happen.
- Rule: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event2 happened initially and that forces event1 to happen, C1 is true in this scenario.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 = (C2 holds) AND (event1 happens) = false AND true = false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold.
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens.

Step 2 — parse the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → given event2, event1 will occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen → this just stops further events after event1.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions:
- From the context, event2 has happened and thus event1 must happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 requires C2 to be true and event1 to happen; since C2 is false, C3 is false (even though event1 does happen).

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 is the conjunction: (C2 is true) AND (event1 happens).

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 already happened initially, event1 must happen at some point.
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- C1: Event1 always happens. Given Rule A and the initial event2, event1 does indeed have to happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: C1 does not hold. But C1 does hold, so C2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 requires C2 to hold. C2 is false. Even though event1 does happen, the conjunction ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" is false because C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (“C2 does not hold”) is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Cs
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. any occurrence of event2 requires a subsequent event1).
  - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” — this is true at the start because event1 happened initially.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” — means at every point in time (in every reachable state) it must be true that event1 will eventually happen in the future from that point.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” — the negation of C2.

Step 3 — reason about C2
- Initially C1 is true (event1 has happened).
- But because event1 is terminal, once we are in the state after event1 occurs there are no further events; from that state there is no future occurrence of event1. So at that later point, “event1 eventually happens” is false (there is no future event1).
- Therefore C1 does not hold at all reachable points in time, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion about C3
- C2 is false, so C3 (“C2 does not hold”) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true at the start because event1 happened initially.
2. After event1 no other events can happen, so once you are in a state after that initial occurrence there will be no future occurrence of event1.
3. At those later states C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false (there is no future event1).
4. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false — C1 does not hold at every time.
5. C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is thus true.
---
C3 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is ""event1 eventually happens."" That is true because event1 has already happened initially.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so there are no future occurrences of event2 (or anything else).
- Therefore from every reachable state (the initial state, and there are no later states with different events) C1 holds — event1 has happened and remains true as ""event1 eventually happens"" (it already did).
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
You ask whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is just equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is the negation of C1.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" means C2 is true at all times.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate C1
Context: initially event1 happened; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen. Starting from the initial event1, event2 will occur (and they will alternate thereafter). Therefore C1 is true (event2 does happen).

Step 4 — propagate truth values
- Since C1 is true, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
- C3 requires C2 to hold always; because C2 is false, C3 cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 says ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and consequences
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules force alternation: after event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1.
- So the actual sequence (starting from the initial fact) is: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, … In particular, event2 does happen (at least at the first required step).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction but is true because event2 does occur in the sequence.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That would require C2 to be true at all times. But C2 is false (as just shown), so C3 cannot be true.

Final answer
False
---
First identify the question: is C3 (""C2 always holds"") true given the context?

Examine the conditions:
- Context: event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So events alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ⇔ ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" ⇔ ""At all times, event2 does not happen.""

Reasoning:
- From the context, event2 does happen (immediately after the initial event1 and repeatedly thereafter).
- Therefore C1 is true (event2 happens).
- Hence C2 (which says C1 does not hold) is false.
- Since C2 is false at least at the time(s) when event2 occurs, C2 does not ""always hold.""

Conclusion: C3 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and what each condition says
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one must have event1). After event1, event2 must happen (they alternate).
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds.
- C3: Event1 happens or C2 holds.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate the conditions
- Starting point: initial state had event2.
- By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state has event1. So ""Event1 happens"" (in the next state) is true.
- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true (because event1 happens).
- C3 (""Event1 happens or C2 holds"") is true, since event1 does happen (and C2 is also true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify target:
We must decide the truth of C3 (Event1 happens or C2 holds) in the initial situation.

Step 2 — examine conditions given the initial state:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- ""After Event2, Event1 must happen"" ⇒ in the next state, Event1 occurs.
- ""After Event1, Event2 must happen"" ⇒ in the state after that, Event2 occurs (not the immediate next state).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3 at the initial state:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False, because the next state contains Event1 (by the first rule), not Event2.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Event1 does happen in the next state, so C2 is True (regardless of C1).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is True, so C3 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens or C2 holds"") is true given the initial conditions and the rules.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" = next(event2).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" = event1 ∨ next(event2).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" = event1 ∨ (event1 ∨ next(event2)) = event1 ∨ next(event2). So C3 and C2 are equivalent.

Step 3 — trace the events from the context
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", at s1 we must have event1.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", at s2 we have event2, etc.
- So states alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C3 at the initial state
- At s0: event1 is false (event2 occurred at s0), and next(event2) is false because s1 has event1, not event2.
- Therefore C3 is false at the initial state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C3 asserts “C2 always holds.” We must determine whether C2 is true in the given situation, and hence whether C3 is true.

Step 2 — examine the premises
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does occur (at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never happens given the previous line).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event1 always happens. Given the premise “Initially, event1 happened” and that no alternative initial possibility is given, C1 holds in this scenario.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. Here C1 does hold, but because event1 has happened and it prevents any further events, event2 cannot happen. Thus the implication “if C1 then event2” is false in this context (true antecedent, false consequent).
- C3: C2 always holds. Since C2 is false in the given situation, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So in the (actual) execution event1 occurs and no further events (in particular event2) can occur.

- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): given the initial occurrence and the impossibility of any further events, C1 holds in the actual execution.

- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens""): since C1 holds here but event2 cannot happen (because event1 already occurred and prevents any further events), C2 is false.

- C3 (""C2 always holds""): because C2 is false in the given situation, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is just ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" = ""Event2 happens at all times"".
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" = ""at some future time, Event2 will hold always"".

From the context: initially Event1 happened, and after Event1 no other events can happen. Therefore Event2 never happens (it cannot occur now or later). So C1 is false at all times, C2 is false, and there is no time at which C2 becomes true.

Final answer: False
---
Let's go step by step.

1. Interpret the context:
   - Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial moment event1 has occurred).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred the system has no further events).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

2. Interpret the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the proposition ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., at all times, event2 happens.
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some time in the future, it becomes true that event2 happens at all (subsequent) times.

3. Reasoning about the timeline:
   - Since initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen at any time.
   - Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen).
   - Consequently C2 is false (C1 is not true at all times).
   - Since C2 is never true at any time, it cannot become true at some future time; thus C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 says: ""C2 eventually holds."" So we must decide whether there will be a time after which C1 holds at all future times.

Step 2 — clarify the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the system produces no further events).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the given ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" is redundant).
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., from some time onward, at every moment C1 is true).
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., there exists a time after which C1 is always true).

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequence:
- At the initial moment event1 occurred.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, no further events ever occur. In particular, event2 does not occur at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (""event2 happens"") is false (event2 never occurs).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (C1 is false at all times).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (call that time/state t0).
- After event2, no other events can happen at any later time (so at t1, t2, ... no events occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after event2).

Step 3 — interpret C1, C2, C3 at the initial state t0:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" means event2 occurs at t1. But after event2 at t0 no events can happen, so event2 does NOT occur at t1. Therefore C1 is false at t0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means that at t1, C1 is true (i.e., event2 would occur at t2). But since no events can happen after t0, event2 does not occur at t2, so C1 is false at t1. Therefore C2 is false at t0.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" is the negation of C2. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Start (s0): event2 has already happened.
- The rule “after event2, no other events can happen” means no events occur in any future state after s0. So in s1 and all later states there are no events.
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — this is false, because no events (including event2) can occur in the next state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — this is false as well, because in s1 there will be no event2 in s2, so C1 is not true in s1.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- In the initial state s0, event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (there are no further observable events after s0).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 does not occur in s0 and cannot occur after event2.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state (if any) has no events (by “after event2 no other events can happen”), so event2 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false at s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asserts that in s0’s next state, C1 is true — i.e., that in the successor’s next state event2 happens. But no events can happen after event2, so this cannot be true. Therefore C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, the hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so nothing can change that fact.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 did not occur (event2 was first).

Evaluate the claims:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" True (both disjuncts are true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts C2 is false, but C2 is true.

Therefore C3 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" The question asks whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So no events occur after that initial event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 does not occur after event2 and there is no indication it happened before.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" True — in fact both disjuncts are true (C1 is true and event2 happened).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This claims C2 is false, but C2 is true.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step:

1. Identify the statements:
   - Context: initially event2 happened.
   - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens.""
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (i.e., ¬C2)

2. Evaluate C1:
   - Since event2 already happened initially, ""event2 eventually happens"" is true. So C1 = True.

3. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"". C1 is True, so the disjunction is True. Thus C2 = True.

4. Evaluate C3:
   - C3 is the negation of C2. Since C2 is True, C3 = False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the described event constraints.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., neither event1 nor event2 happens)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, neither event1 nor event2 happens)

Step 3 — use the context to reason about states
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So events alternate, meaning at every state one of {event1, event2} happens.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- Because at every state either event1 or event2 happens, C1 is true in the current state and in every next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false now and also false in the next state.
- Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""event1 or event2 holds"" in a state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event1 nor event2 holds) in the current state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds).

Step 2 — use the context rules:
- Initially event1 happens (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the state following any state where event1 is true must have event2 true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so states alternate event1, event2, event1, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- At the initial state C1 is true (because event1 holds), so C2 is false now.
- The next state after the initial state must have event2 (by the ""after event1"" rule), so in that next state C1 is again true (event2 holds), hence C2 is false there.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (a statement about some state).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (so neither event1 nor event2 happens in that state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state neither event1 nor event2 happens).

Step 2 — use the context to trace states
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So the sequence of events is: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... — in every state exactly one of event1 or event2 happens.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 is true in every state (because in every state either event1 or event2 occurs).
- Therefore C2 (negation of C1) is false in every state.
- C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state, but C2 is always false, so C3 is false.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the question:
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen.
  This enforces an alternating sequence starting with event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, both events do occur (event1 initially and then event2), so C1 is true (indeed true globally for the run).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true in the model (both events occur), the implication in C2 is true whenever evaluated (a true consequent makes the implication true, regardless of whether event2 has occurred yet). So C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is true (as argued) and that truth does not depend on time (C1 is already satisfied by the run), C2 holds at all times; therefore C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 says: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether, under the given rules about events, C2 is true at every point (i.e., is an invariant).

Step 2 — understand the rules and each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After any event1, event2 must happen. After any event2, event1 must happen. So the system produces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, both events do occur (event1 initially and event2 follows), so C1 is true (both events occur in the run).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Whenever event2 happens, event2 already holds (by hypothesis) and by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" an event1 will occur as well; hence both events occur, so C1 holds. Therefore C2 is true whenever event2 happens; if at some moment event2 hasn't happened yet, the implication is vacuously true.

Step 3 — is C2 always true (C3)?
At every point in time either:
- event2 has not happened yet → the implication ""if event2 happens then C1"" is vacuously true, or
- event2 has happened → by the rule, an event1 will occur as well, so C1 holds and the implication is true.

Thus there is no possible moment where the antecedent is true and the consequent false. Therefore C2 holds at all times.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C3 asserts that the statement C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is always true. We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context rules.

Step 2 — understand the context and the C-conditions
- Context rules: initially event1 happens. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So events alternate indefinitely: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — i.e., both events occur (at some times).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" That is, whenever an event2 occurs, both events occur (somewhere on the timeline).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That is, at every point in time the implication in C2 is true.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- From the rules, both events do occur (event1 initially, then event2, then event1 again, etc.), so C1 is true in the timeline (both events happen).
- Consider C2 at any time:
  - If event2 does not occur at that time, C2 is vacuously true.
  - If event2 does occur at some time, the context rule guarantees an event1 will occur after that event2, so both events occur and thus C1 is true. So the implication in C2 is true whenever its antecedent holds.
- Therefore C2 is true at every point in time (vacuously before any event2, and ensured-after whenever event2 occurs). So C2 always holds.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the claim to evaluate: ""C1 holds or C2 holds.""
- C1 and C2 are each ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., they both assert that Event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so Event1 will occur at least once after the initial Event2).
- After Event1, no other events can happen (Event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace allowed sequences:
- The only consistent sequence is: Event2 (initial) → Event1 (required) → stop. Thus Event1 does happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- Since Event1 happens, the conjunction ""Event1 happens and Event1 happens"" is true, so C1 is true and C2 is true.
- Therefore ""C1 or C2"" (C3) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", and both C1 and C2 are just the same statement ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" (a redundant conjunction). So C3 amounts to asserting that event1 happens.
- From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Since event2 has already happened initially, that requirement forces event1 to occur after it.
- The clause ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only restricts what happens after event1, it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Therefore event1 does happen, so C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" (equivalent to ""Event1 happens"").
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds, so C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".

Step 2 — parse the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 will occur after the initial event2.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This only restricts events after event1; it does not prevent event1 itself.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: event2 occurs (given).
- By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 occurs afterward.
- After event1, nothing else happens.

Step 4 — conclude:
- Event1 does happen, so C1 (and C2) hold, and thus C3 holds.

Step 1 — interpret the scenario:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After any event2, event1 must occur next.
- After any event1, event2 must occur next.
So the events alternate: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...

Step 2 — examine C1 (""Event1 always happens""):
- ""Always happens"" means at every state/event occurrence event1 holds.
- That is false: state0 (and all even states) are event2, not event1. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — examine C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""):
- From the initial state, the next state is state1 (event1). Does C1 hold from state1 onward? No, because state2 is event2, so event1 does not occur at every state. Thus C2 is false.

Step 4 — examine C3 (""C2 always holds""):
- C2 is already false at the initial state, so it cannot be that C2 always holds. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

First identify the meanings:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (globally G event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G X C1).

From the context we have an infinite alternating trace starting with event2:
s0: event2 (not event1)
s1: event1 (not event2)
s2: event2
s3: event1
...

Evaluate:
- C1 is false at s0 because event1 is false at s0.
- C2 at s0 requires that in s1, C1 (G event1) holds. But s1 is followed by s2 where event1 is false, so C1 does not hold in s1. Thus C2 is false at s0.
- C3 requires C2 to hold at every state; since C2 is already false at s0 (and in fact false at every state), C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 asserts: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 asserts: ""C1 always holds."" C1 asserts: ""Event2 does not happen.""

So C3 says: in the next state, it will be true that (always from that point on) event2 never happens.

Step 2 — use the context
We are told: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 and event2 must alternate; in particular, because event1 has just happened, event2 is required to occur in the future (at or by the next transition).

Step 3 — evaluate C1, C2, C3
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false because the context requires event2 to occur after event1.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false — it asserts that event2 never happens ever, which contradicts the requirement that event2 must occur.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is also false: even in the next state the requirement that event2 must occur (coming from the alternation) prevents ""event2 never happens"" from holding always.

Conclusion
False
---
Step 1 — identify the formulas:
- C1: ¬(event2) (event2 does not happen).
- C2: always C1 (globally ¬event2 in all states).
- C3: in the next state, C2 holds (X (always ¬event2)).

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state event2 will occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (they alternate).

Step 3 — evaluate:
- In the next state (immediately after the initial state), event2 does happen, so C1 (¬event2) is false in that next state.
- Therefore C2 (always ¬event2) is false in that next state.
- Hence C3 (that C2 holds in the next state) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event2 never happens at any time).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., starting in the next state, event2 never happens).

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Thus, from the initial state an occurrence of event2 is required (at least in the immediate next state or eventually—either way, event2 cannot be permanently absent).

Step 4 — derive consequences
- Because event2 must occur after the initial event1, C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 says: (Event1 happens and Event2 happens) OR (Event1 happens and Event2 happens). So C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" (C1 and C2 are identical).

Step 2 — examine the context
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So Event2 has already occurred at the initial point.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once Event2 has occurred, there can be no events at later times.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So if Event1 occurs at some time, Event2 must occur afterwards.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Event2 has already happened initially; because of ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" no events can occur after that initial Event2.
- Could Event1 have happened before Event2? No: the context states Event2 happened initially (at the start), so there is no earlier time for Event1 to have occurred.
- Could Event1 happen at the same time as Event2? That would violate ""after event1, event2 must happen"" which requires Event2 to occur after Event1, not only simultaneously. Also ""after event2 no other events can happen"" prevents any event after Event2, so Event1 cannot occur after it.

Thus Event1 cannot have occurred in any allowed way, while Event2 did occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since Event1 cannot have happened, ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" is false. Therefore C3 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 is ""(Event1 happens and Event2 happens) or (Event1 happens and Event2 happens)"". This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" (same disjunct twice). So C3 asserts that both Event1 and Event2 happen.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, Event2 happened. So Event2 has happened (true).
- After Event2, no other events can happen. So once Event2 has occurred, no further events (including Event1) can occur afterward.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (i.e., if Event1 occurs, Event2 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Event2 already occurred initially. Because no events can happen after Event2, Event1 cannot occur after that.
- Could Event1 have occurred before the initial Event2? The context says ""Initially, Event2 happened,"" which rules out an earlier Event1. If Event1 had occurred earlier, then by the rule ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"" Event2 would have to occur after that Event1; that would place Event2 after Event1, contradicting that Event2 is initial. So Event1 cannot have happened earlier either.
- Therefore Event1 does not occur at any point. Event2 does occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" is false (Event1 does not happen).
- Hence C3 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C3 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", and both C1 and C2 assert the same thing: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"". So C3 is true exactly when both Event1 and Event2 happen (equivalently: when Event1 happens, since Event2 is given to happen initially).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no events (including event1) can occur subsequently.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This is a requirement that if event1 occurs, event2 must (then) occur — but it does not force event1 to occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Event2 did occur initially.
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after that.
- Could event1 have occurred before the initial event2? No: the statement says event2 happened initially (at the start), so there is no earlier time for event1 to have happened.
- Therefore event1 does not occur at any time.

Step 4 — conclude about C1/C2/C3
- C1 (""Event1 and Event2 happen"") is false because Event1 does not happen.
- C2 is the same and is false.
- Hence C3 (C1 or C2) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 has occurred.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (The run is terminal after event2.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Not relevant because event1 did not occur in the given initial situation.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context that event2 did happen initially. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 both to happen and not happen simultaneously (since C1 asserts event2 does not happen). That is impossible, and in particular false in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false (already false in the initial state), it cannot be true that C2 always holds.

Final answer: False
---
First, what the hypothesis asks: whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Examine each condition with the context:
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, once event2 has happened, no other events can happen afterward. (So event2 does occur in the actual history.)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 both to happen and not happen simultaneously; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false in the actual history (and in any history consistent with the context), C3 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C3 is False. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 claims ""C2 always holds."" We must determine whether that claim is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds (i.e., event2 happens AND event2 does not happen).
- C3: C2 always holds.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context says initially event2 happened, so C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false right away.
- C2 requires both ""event2 happens"" and ""event2 does not happen"" simultaneously — a direct contradiction — so C2 is impossible (false) at any time.
- If C2 is false, then ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true.

- C1 = ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2 = ""Event2 does not happen.""
- Therefore C3 is just ""Event2 does not happen.""

From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen. That makes C1 false and C2 false, hence their disjunction C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". C1 and C2 both assert ""Event2 does not happen"", so C3 is equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine context:
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" That directly asserts that event2 did happen.
- The other rules (after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen) do not negate the initial fact that event2 happened.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions:
- Since event2 did happen, the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" is false. Therefore C1 is false and C2 is false.
- Consequently C3 (""C1 or C2"") is also false.

Final answer: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". Both C1 and C2 are the same claim: ""Event1 eventually happens"". So C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens"".

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, no further events — including event1 — can occur.)
- The fact ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 does not occur in the given scenario.

Step 3 — reason through the event sequence
- Since event2 has occurred initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- Therefore ""Event1 eventually happens"" is false (so C1 and C2 are both false).

Conclusion
- C3 (C1 or C2) is false.

- The clause about ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Since event2 already happened initially and that prevents any further events, event1 cannot happen at or after the initial state.

Examine the context:

- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event1 never occurs.)

Trace the sequence:
- Event2 has already happened initially.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, no subsequent events (including event1) can occur.
- There is no indication event1 happened before event2; the statement ""initially, event2 happened"" places event2 at the start, so event1 does not occur at any time.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the formulas:
- C1 = ""event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1 = X X event1), i.e. event1 happens two steps from now.
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2 = X X X event1), i.e. event1 happens three steps from now.

From the context: at time 0 event1 happened. Also after event1, event2 must happen at some point, and once event2 happens no further events can happen. Thus some finite future state will contain event2 and after that there are no events.

A possible (and allowed) timeline consistent with the context is:
- time 0: event1 (given),
- time 1: event2 (event2 happens immediately after event1),
- times ≥2: no events (because after event2 no events can happen).

Under this timeline:
- C1 (event1 at time1) is false (time1 has event2).
- Therefore C2 and C3 (which require event1 at times 2 and 3 respectively) are also false.

Because such a timeline is consistent with the given constraints, C3 is not guaranteed to be true. Therefore the correct answer is:

False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 is true given the context. C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — expand the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (X event1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X(C1) = XX event1 (event1 holds two steps ahead)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = X(C2) = XXX event1 (event1 holds three steps ahead)

So C3 asserts that event1 occurs three steps after the current state.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context
- Initially (current state) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 occurs next.
- After event2, no other events can happen → no events occur after that.

Thus the timeline is: state0: event1; state1: event2; state2 and beyond: no events.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 requires event1 at state3 (three steps ahead). But event1 occurs only at state0 and never again (state1 has event2, and after that nothing). Therefore event1 does not occur three steps ahead.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 = ""event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time 1).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1 is true at time 1, so event1 would have to happen at time 2).
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C2 is true at time 1, so C1 would have to hold at time 2, meaning event1 at time 3).

Step 2 — constraints from the context
- Initially (time 0) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur after time 0).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace consistent with the constraints
The only consistent sequence is: time 0: event1; time 1: event2 (must happen after event1); times ≥2: no events (because after event2 no events can happen).

Step 4 — evaluate C1, C2, C3 on that trace
- C1 (event1 at time 1): false (time 1 has event2).
- C2 (C1 at time 1, i.e. event1 at time 2): false (after event2 no events occur, so event1 cannot occur at time 2).
- C3 (C2 at time 1, i.e. C1 at time 2, i.e. event1 at time 3): false for the same reason.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Interpretations:
  - Context: initially event1 happened. Also, ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs (and likewise once event2 occurs) the execution is terminal — no further events can occur afterward.
  - C1: event1 happens and event2 happens (both must occur at some times).
  - C2: eventually C1 holds (at some future point both events have happened).
  - C3: if event1 happens, then C2 holds (i.e., whenever event1 happens, eventually both event1 and event2 will have happened).

- Examine feasibility:
  - event1 has already happened initially (antecedent of C3 is true).
  - Because event1 has happened, no other events can happen after that, so event2 cannot occur after event1.
  - There is no possibility for event2 to have occurred before event1, because event1 happened initially (at the start).
  - Therefore it's impossible for both event1 and event2 to ever hold; C1 is false and so is C2.

- Therefore C3 (which requires C2 to hold whenever event1 happens) is false (antecedent true but consequent false).
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context and the conditions
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- Context: After event1, no other events can happen.
- Context: After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: C1 eventually holds (i.e., at some time both events have happened).
- C3: If event1 happens, then C2 holds.

Step 3 — Reasoning about possible event sequences
- event1 already happened initially.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time after the initial event1. There is no way for both event1 and event2 to hold.
- Hence C1 is false (both cannot happen), and so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C3
- C3 is the implication: if event1 happens (which is true), then C2 holds (which is false).
- A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C3 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Also ""After event2, no other events can happen.""
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (both occur)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (eventually both event1 and event2 occur)
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" (whenever event1 happens, eventually both happen)

Step 3 — trace the event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially, the antecedent of C3 (""event1 happens"") is true in the actual timeline.
- The context also says that after event1 no other events can happen, so once event1 occurs there is no way for event2 to happen afterward.
- Therefore both-event condition C1 cannot become true after event1, so C2 (""eventually C1"") is false in this timeline.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- C3 is an implication with a true antecedent (event1 happens) and a false consequent (C2 does not hold), so the implication is false.

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since event2 happens (given), C2 is True (it would also be true because C1 holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts C2 is false.

Step 3 — conclusion:
C2 is True, therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer:
False
---
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

1. From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Therefore event2 occurred, and event1 did not occur afterward (hence did not occur at all).
2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — True.
3. C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — True (event2 happens, and C1 also holds).
4. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — False, because C2 does hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
You ask whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterward.
- After event1, no other events can happen (redundant here since event1 didn’t occur).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Event2 did happen (and C1 also holds), so the disjunction C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Since C2 is True, C3 is False.

Summary reasoning (concise):

1. Context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" Therefore event1 is true.
2. C1 is ""event1 or event1"", which is equivalent to event1, so C1 is true.
3. C2 is ""event1 and C1"", so C2 is true ∧ true = true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the context as temporal constraints:
   - Initial state (state 0): event1 happened.
   - Whenever event1 happens at some state, event2 must happen at the next relevant point (so event2 follows).
   - Whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterwards (so event1 follows).

2. Trace the sequence starting from the initial state:
   - State 0: event1.
   - By “after event1, event2 must happen” → State 1: event2.
   - By “after event2, event1 must happen” → State 2: event1.
   - This repeats, giving an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1 (Event1 always happens): false — event1 does not hold in every state (it fails in state 1, state 3, ...).
   - C2 (C1 holds in the next state): false — at the next state (state 1) C1 is not true (event1 does not always hold from state 1).
   - C3 (C2 always holds): false — since C2 is false already at the initial state, C2 does not hold always.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
First identify the question: C3 is the claim ""C2 always holds."" We must decide True or False given the system constraints.

Examine the system:
- Initially event1 happened (state s0: event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen → the next state s1 has event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → the next state s2 has event1.
Thus the system forces an alternation: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. at every state). This is false, because in the alternating sequence event2 states (s1, s3, ...) do not have event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. at the next state, event1 always happens). From s0 the next state s1 does not satisfy C1, so C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 fails (already at the initial state), C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False. Final answer: False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

Interpretation of the conditions:
- ""Always"" means at every state (globally).
- C1: G(event1) — event1 holds at every state.
- C2: X(C1) — in the next state, C1 holds (i.e., from the next state onward event1 always holds).
- C3: G(C2) — at every state, C2 holds (i.e., at every state, from the next state onward event1 always holds).

From the context:
- Initially (t=0) event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → at t=1 event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → at t=2 event1.
Thus the timeline alternates: t=0: event1, t=1: event2, t=2: event1, t=3: event2, ...

Check the conditions:
- C1 (event1 always) is false because event1 does not hold at t=1 (and other odd times).
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is false at t=0 because at t=1 event1 is not true at every future time.
- C3 (C2 always) is therefore false (C2 fails already at t=0).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So starting from the initial event2, event1 will occur afterward, and then event2 will occur after that, and so on — the two events alternate and both occur (now or eventually).
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" (i.e., at the time in question, one of the events occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (i.e., whenever event1 or event2 happens, event2 happens — either now if event2 is the one occurring, or eventually after event1.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e., C2 is true at all relevant times.)

Step 3 — trace the sequences and evaluate C2
- If C1 holds because event2 just happened, then event2 happens (trivially true).
- If C1 holds because event1 happened, the context states that after event1, event2 must happen — so event2 will happen (eventually). Thus the implication in C2 is satisfied in that case as well.

Because every time C1 is true (whether due to event2 now or event1 now), event2 either has happened or is guaranteed to happen, C2 holds in every case. Therefore C2 holds always.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says “C2 always holds.” So we must decide whether the implication C2 = “If C1 then event2” is true in all situations given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After an occurrence of event2, event1 must occur (so event1 will follow every event2).
- After an occurrence of event1, event2 must occur (so event2 will follow every event1).

C1 is “event1 happens or event2 happens.” C2 is “if C1 then event2 happens.”

Step 3 — case analysis
Whenever C1 holds there are two possibilities:
- C1 holds because event2 happens. Then event2 indeed happens (trivially).
- C1 holds because event1 happens. By the context, after event1 occurs, event2 must occur. So event2 will happen (perhaps later).

If C1 doesn't hold, the implication C2 is vacuously true.

Step 4 — conclusion
In every case where C1 holds, event2 happens (either immediately or eventually), and where C1 doesn't hold C2 is vacuously true. Therefore C2 holds always. So C3 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step by step):

- The context gives an initial event2, plus the rules “after event2, event1 must happen” and “after event1, event2 must happen.” So the system produces an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

- C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") is true in this system (event2 happens initially and events continue to occur).

- C2 (""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"") holds because whenever the disjunction C1 is true there are two cases:
  - If event2 is the case, then event2 already happens.
  - If event1 is the case, the context rule ensures that event2 will happen afterwards.
  Thus the implication in C2 is satisfied whenever C1 holds.

- C3 claims that C2 always holds. Given the alternating rules, C2 will indeed hold at all times (every time C1 holds, event2 either has happened or will happen). Therefore C3 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 states: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (a disjunction)
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
- Event2 does happen (it happened initially).
- The context requires that after event2, event1 must happen, so event1 does in fact happen.
- Given that event1 happens, the disjunction C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true (because one disjunct is true).
- Therefore, in the situation where event2 happens, C2 holds.

Step 4 — conclusion
The implication in C3 is satisfied under the given context, so C3 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 does occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 does occur following that initial event2.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Timeline ends after event1.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context there is an initial event2 and that forces event1 to happen afterwards, so in the only possible timeline described event1 does occur. Thus C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true, so C2 holds (and in fact event1 also happens directly).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" We have event2 happening (initially) and we have established C2 holds. Therefore the implication is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- Context: event2 happened initially. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (not necessarily given by context)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C2 when event2 happens
- The context guarantees that whenever event2 happens, event1 will happen afterward.
- Therefore, in any case where event2 happens, event1 happens, so the disjunction in C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true because its first disjunct is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
- Since whenever event2 happens C2 is true, the implication in C3 holds.

Sample responses:
What is asked: whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the scenario.

Setup (index states):
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so s1: event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so s2: no events (and nothing thereafter).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — at s0 the next state is s1, and event1 does not happen there (event2 does). So C1 is false at s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this says that at s0, in s1 C1 is true, i.e. event1 happens in s2. But after s1 (where event2 happens) no events can happen, so event1 does not happen in s2. Thus C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is already false at s0, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide if C2 is true in every state given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Immediately after event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
  - From the context, right after event1 the next state contains event2, not event1. So C1 is false (in the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
  - That requires that in the next state, C1 is true (i.e., in the next state's next state event1 occurs). But after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur later. Thus C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false (at least in the initial state).

Step 3 — conclusion about C3:
- Since C2 is false (there exists a state — the initial state — where C2 does not hold), C2 does not always hold. Therefore C3 is False.

False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 asserts ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every state C2 is true).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initial state s0: event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → in s1 we have event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen → from s2 onward no events occur.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state is s1, which has event2, not event1. So C1 is false at s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That requires C1 to be true at s1, i.e. event1 in s2. But s2 has no events, so C1 is false at s1, so C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is already false at s0, C3 cannot hold.

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True, because C1 holds (so the disjunction is satisfied).

Question: Is C3 (C2 holds and event2 happens) true or false?

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen afterward; and whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterward.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" C1 holds, so C2 is true (and independently, the rule after event1 implies event2 will occur as well).
- Event2 happens: Since event1 occurred initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will indeed occur at some later time.
- Therefore C3 (C2 holds and event2 happens) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We are asked whether C3 is true, where
  - C1: Event1 eventually happens.
  - C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.
  - C3: C2 holds and event2 happens.

Step 2 — understand the context constraints:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 has already occurred.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Once event1 occurs, event2 will occur later.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Once event2 occurs, event1 will occur later.)

Step 3 — examine each condition in light of the context:
- C1 (event1 eventually happens): True, because event1 already happened initially.
- From “after event1, event2 must happen” and the initial event1, event2 will (necessarily) occur at some later time. So event2 happens is True.
- C2 (“event2 happens or C1 holds”): True, because both disjuncts are actually true (C1 holds and event2 happens).
- C3 (“C2 holds and event2 happens”): Since C2 is true and event2 happens is true, C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold."" The question asks whether C3 is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has already happened.  
- After event1 no other events can happen → there are no transitions leaving the state where event1 has occurred (no next state after that).  
- The clause about event2 is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true because it has already happened in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no transition) after the state where event1 has occurred, so C2 does not hold (the next-state claim is false when there is no successor).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Context: event1 occurs in the initial state. After event1 (and after event2 if it ever happens) no further events can occur — so the only occurrence of event1 is at the initial state.
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” This is true in the initial state because event1 already happened there (eventually in temporal logic includes the current state).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” From the next state’s perspective, there are no future occurrences of event1 (it occurred only in the past/initial state), so “event1 eventually happens” is false in the next state.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context: Initially, event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (and there is an unrelated statement about event2 which never becomes relevant because event1 already happened).
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since event1 already happened in the initial state, C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether, from the next state, event1 still eventually happens (i.e., whether event1 occurs at or after that next state).
- Because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" there are no further events after the initial occurrence of event1. Thus from the next state onward event1 does not occur again, so C1 is false in the next state. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 states: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future state C1 holds in the next state).

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Context timeline: state0: event1 happens. Then state1: event2 must happen. After that (state2 and onward) no events happen.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means event1 holds at every state (globally).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means at the current state, in the immediate next state C1 is true (i.e., from that next state onward event1 holds forever).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition on the timeline
- C1 is false: event1 happens at state0 but does not occur at state1 or later, so it is not true at every state.
- C2 at state0 is false: at state1 event1 does not hold at every future state, so C1 does not hold in the next state.
- Could C2 ever become true later? After state1 (after event2) no further events occur; there is no future state where event1 starts holding forever. Thus C2 never becomes true at any later state.

Step 4 — conclusion about C3
- Since C2 never holds at any future state, ""C2 eventually holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future state C2 is true.
- C2 is “C1 holds in the next state.”
- C1 is “Event1 always happens” (i.e., at every state from that point on).

Interpretation of the context:
- Initially event1 happens (event1 at the initial state).
- Immediately after that, event2 must happen (event2 at the next state).
- After event2, no further events can occur (no event1 at any later state).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the event sequence: event1 occurs only at the initial state, event2 at the next state, and thereafter nothing happens.
2. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would require event1 to hold at every state. That fails because after event2 there are states where event1 does not happen. So C1 is false (in fact false at every state).
3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") requires C1 to be true in some next state. But since C1 is false everywhere, C2 is false in every state.
4. Therefore there is no future state where C2 holds, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — what C3 asks:
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" So there must be some future state where C2 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every state).

Step 2 — consequences of the context:
- Initially event1 happens (at the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at some next state event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so from the state where event2 has occurred onward, event1 does not occur).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- C1 requires event1 to occur at every state. That is false: at the state where event2 occurs, event1 does not occur, and after that no events occur. So C1 is false at (and from) that point onward. Therefore C1 is not true in all states.

Step 4 — consequences for C2 and C3:
- Since C1 is false globally, there is no state whose next state satisfies ""C1 holds"" (C2 is false at every state).
- If C2 is never true, then ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C3 asserts: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Initially (state 0): event1 happens.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 holds at some state, event2 must hold at the next state).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 holds at some state, event1 must hold at the next state).
- These two rules force alternation: event1 at even states (0,2,4,...) and event2 at odd states (1,3,5,...).

Step 3 — examine C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From state 0, the next state (state 1) has event2, not event1. So C1 is false at state 0. More generally, whenever event1 holds at a state, the next state has event2, so C1 is false at every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false at every state, C2 is false at every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 never holds (it is false at all states), C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially (state 0), event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after any state where event1 happens must have event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after any state where event2 happens must have event1).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state (where event1 happened), the next state must satisfy ""after event1, event2 must happen"", so the next state must have event2, not event1. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false (already fails at the first transition), so C3 cannot hold.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 ≡ ""Event1 happens"", C2 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" ≡ ""Event1 happens always (at all times)"".

Step 3 — use the context
The context states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur (at the initial time). Once an event has happened, the fact ""event1 happened"" remains true for all later times (there is no information making that past occurrence false later). The forced future events (event2 must happen, then nothing else) do not negate that event1 happened.

Step 4 — conclusion
Since event1 did happen initially, C2 (which is just ""event1 happens"") is true and remains true at all times. Therefore C3 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""  
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens"" (since C1 is ""Event1 happens"").

So both C1 and C2 are equivalent to the single fact ""Event1 happens.""

Step 3 — use the context
- The context says: initially, event1 happened. So the proposition ""Event1 happens"" is true (it occurred). Nothing in the context ever negates or removes that occurrence; later event2 happens and then nothing else happens, but that does not undo the fact that event1 happened.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 says ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is equivalent to the fact that event1 happened, and that fact is true (and not negated later), C2 holds in all states reachable from the initial one. Therefore C3 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C3 states “C2 always holds.” We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event1 happens.” This is equivalent to “Event1 happens” (p ∨ p ⇔ p).
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds.” Since C1 ≡ “Event1 happens,” C2 also simplifies to “Event1 happens.”

Step 3 — use the context / trace events
The context says: initially event1 happened; then event2 must happen; after event2 no other events occur. So event1 is true at the initial moment, then event2 occurs, and afterwards event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate “always”
C2 is equivalent to “Event1 happens.” That is true at the initial moment but not at later times (after event2 no events, so event1 does not hold then). Therefore C2 does not hold at all times.

Conclusion
C3 (“C2 always holds”) is False."

False

Step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened, and the rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means nothing can occur after that initial event1.
- Therefore every possible execution has event1 (at the start) and then no further events.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is true (every trace includes event1).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds initially, so it holds (indeed immediately).
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") contradicts the above, so C3 is False.
---
First identify the meaning: C1 is the claim ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. from a point onward event1 holds at every moment). C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists a time after which event1 holds always). C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" (¬(C2)).

From the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no further occurrences of event1 or any other event occur after the initial moment.

Reasoning:
- C1 (event1 holds at every time point from some time on) is false: event1 occurs at the initial instant only and does not continue to occur at later times, so there is no suffix of the timeline where event1 is true at every moment.
- Therefore C2 (""there exists a time after which C1 holds"") is false.
- Thus C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Sample responses:
First: the hypothesis is asking whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true or false.

Step 1 — evaluate C1:
C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.

Step 2 — evaluate C2:
C2 states ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 does hold (it's true everywhere), C2 is false in every state.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state."" There are two ways to see this:
- Even if a next state existed, C2 is false there (C2 is false in every state), so C3 would be false.
- More concretely, the context says ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" and initially event2 already happened, so there is no next state at all; by the usual semantics of ""next,"" a formula ""holds in the next state"" is false when no next state exists.

Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true or false.

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 holds (is true) in any state.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 does hold, C2 is false in the current state (and would be false in any state).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state. According to the context, after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state. Even if one tried to posit a next state, C2 would still be false there (because C1 is always true). Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Hypothesis C1 (""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"") is a tautology whenever event2 holds; in the initial state event2 did happen, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 claims ""C1 does not hold."" That contradicts the previous point, so C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state."" But after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state in which to evaluate C2 (or, under standard next-state semantics for terminal states, a next-state claim is false). Therefore C3 is false.

So C3 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no further events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just event1 happens (tautological repetition).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — i.e. if event1 happens then event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. it is not the case that (if event1 happens then event2 happens).

Step 3 — trace the events
From the context, event2 happens initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does happen, and event2 also happens (earlier).

Step 4 — evaluate C2 and C3
C2 requires that whenever event1 happens, event2 happens. In the given context there is no scenario where event1 happens without event2 (event2 happened initially), so the implication in C2 is true. Therefore C2 does hold.

C3 asserts that C2 does not hold; since C2 does hold, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Step-by-step:
1. The question asks whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false.
2. C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
3. From the context: event2 happened initially, and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" — therefore event1 does happen. So C1 is true.
4. C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — i.e. ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"".
5. Since event2 did happen (initially) and event1 does happen, the implication in C2 is true (antecedent true, consequent true).
6. Therefore C2 holds, so the statement ""C2 does not hold"" (C3) is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
You ask whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 is true.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event1 will happen.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal; that does not contradict the above.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 does happen (because event2 happened initially and forces event1), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, we check whether event2 happens. Event2 did happen initially, so the consequent is true; hence the implication C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — this claims C2 is false. But we just established C2 is true, so C3 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" only constrains what happens if event1 occurs; it does not force event1 to occur.

Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 no further events can occur, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur at any later time. Nothing in the premises implies that event1 happened before the initial event2.

Conclusion:
Event1 does not eventually happen, so C1 is false, C2 is false, and their disjunction C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"". Both C1 and C2 state the same thing: ""Event1 eventually happens"". So C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This only constrains what must follow event1; it does not force event1 to occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has occurred, the sequence stops.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- The initial state already has event2 occur. Because ""after event2, no other events can happen"", no further events (including event1) can occur after that initial event2.
- There is no information that event1 occurred before the initial event2; the initial fact is that event2 happened, so event1 has not occurred and cannot occur later.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Event1 does not eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 is false, hence C3 (their disjunction) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First identify what C3 asks: C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement (""Event1 eventually happens""), C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Now use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any later time. There is no earlier time indicated when event1 could have happened, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — question
You ask whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1).

Step 3 — trace the events
- Initially event1 occurred.
- By event1 → event2, event2 then happens.
- By event2 → event1, event1 happens again (and this can continue, but at least both events do occur).

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (both occur).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Given C1 is true and event2 is true, this implication is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both conjuncts are true, so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- Determine whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 happens (after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 happens again, and this alternation continues.
- Conclusion: both event1 and event2 do occur (indeed, repeatedly).

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the context, both events occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 does happen, the implication is true. (Even generally, because event2 is true whenever C1 holds here, C2 holds.)
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have C2 true and event2 happens, so C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
You're asking whether C3 is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened. The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" implies event2 will happen at some later time. So both event1 and event2 occur. Therefore C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is true.

2. C2 is the conditional ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 already entails event2 (C1 literally includes ""event2 happens""), the implication C1 → event2 is true. Also, in this situation C1 is true and event2 is true, so C2 holds.

3. C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" We have established C2 is true and event2 happens, so C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will (eventually) occur. i.e., event2 → event1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Interpreted as: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will (eventually) occur. i.e., event1 → event2.

Step 3 — Examine the hypothesis components
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. This is exactly event1 → event2, which is stated in the context.
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Identical to C1.)
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds. Since C1 is entailed by the context, C3 (C1 or C2) is also entailed.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---
Identify goal: Does C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") follow from the context?

Examine conditions:
- Context gives ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That is exactly C1: if event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2 is the same as C1.
- Therefore both C1 and C2 hold given the context.

Since at least one of them holds, C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 is the statement ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (C2 is identical to C1.)
- The context includes: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That is equivalent to the conditional in C1 (and C2).

Step 3 — trace the events
- Initially event1 happened. By the context rule ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 must occur. The circular rule about event2 implying event1 is additional but irrelevant for the truth of C1/C2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since the context directly entails ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens,"" C1 is true (and so is C2). Therefore C3 (""C1 or C2"") is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 does happen following the initial state.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant to the logical truth of C3.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state. Given the context (""after event1, event2 must happen"" and event1 has happened initially), C1 is true.
- C2: C1 does not hold. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: Event2 happens or C2 holds = C1 OR (not C1).

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- With C1 true and C2 false, C3 = True OR False = True.
- Independently, C3 is a classical tautology (C1 OR not C1), so it is always true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event2 happens OR C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C3: Event2 happens OR C2 holds (i.e., C1 ∨ ¬C1).

Step 3 — Use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- The context says: after event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen in the next state → C1 is true.
- Hence C2 (the negation of C1) is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C3
- C3 = C1 ∨ C2 = True ∨ False = True.
- (Independently, C1 ∨ ¬C1 is a tautology, so C3 is always true.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must determine whether C3 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ""Event2 does not happen in the next state.""
- C3: ""Event2 happens OR C2 holds"" i.e. ""Event2 happens in the next state OR Event2 does not happen in the next state.""

Step 3 — logical analysis:
- C3 is of the form (P OR not P), which is a logical tautology — it is true in every possible situation.
- In the given context, after event1, event2 must happen, so C1 is true and C2 is false; therefore C3 = True OR False = True. Even without using the context, C3 is always true.

- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a repeated conjunct does not change truth).
- C2 is identical to C1, so it is also true for the same reason.

- C2 is identical to C1, so it is also equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""

Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- The context says: after event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does indeed happen.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event1 from occurring; it only prevents additional events after it.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true given the three background facts.

Step 2 — understand the background facts
- Initially, event2 happened. That means at the starting (and earliest) point event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur afterwards.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs at some time, a subsequent event2 must occur.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the background, at the initial point event2 has already occurred and no events can happen after that, so there is no time at which event1 can occur (assuming no events prior to the initial point). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" This requires both that event1 happens and that C2 is true. We have seen C2 is false and event1 does not occur in any allowable sequence starting from the given initial state. Therefore C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 asserts: (Event1 happens) AND (C2 holds).
- C2 asserts: C1 always holds.
- C1 asserts: Event1 always happens.

Step 2 — examine the context constraints:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred at the start.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That makes event2 terminal: no events can occur at any later time.
- After event1, event2 must happen. If event1 were to occur, event2 would be required to occur after it.

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur at any time after the initial state.
- Could event1 have occurred before event2? No — the context says event2 happened initially, so there is no earlier time in which event1 could have happened.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur in any allowed sequence.
- Since event1 cannot occur, the statement ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 requires both (Event1 happens) and (C2 holds); both parts are false, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step by step:

1. What the hypothesis asks: C3 asserts both (a) Event1 happens (at least at some time) and (b) C2 holds. C2 says ""C1 always holds."" C1 says ""Event1 always happens."" So C3 requires that Event1 always happens (C1), that this fact always holds (C2), and also that Event1 happens.

2. From the context:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen. That means at all times after the initial event2, no events (including Event1) can occur.
   - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2, and there is no indication event1 happened before the initial event2.

3. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false, because there are times after the initial event2 at which no events can occur, so Event1 cannot hold at those times; it cannot be true at all times.

4. Evaluate C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

5. Therefore C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is false because C2 does not hold (and C1 does not hold).

So C3 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happened.
- The context says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So there can be no events in any state following the initial one.
- C3 asserts that in the next state C2 holds, i.e. both event1 and event2 happen in that next state (because C2 = event1 happens AND C1, and C1 is just ""event2 happens"").
- But no events can occur in the next state (or any state after the initial), so it is impossible for event1 and event2 to both hold there.
- Therefore C2 cannot hold in the next state, so C3 is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 asserts that in the next state, C2 holds.
- C2 says: ""event1 happens AND C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", i.e. simply ""event2 happens.""
- So C3 requires that in the next state both event1 and event2 happen.

Step 2 — relevant facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has occurred in the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs at some time, event1 must occur later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no events in any later states).

Step 3 — trace and reasoning
- Because event1 happened initially, by ""after event1, no other events can happen"" there cannot be any events in any state after the initial state (including the next state).
- C3 would require both event1 and event2 to happen in the next state. That is impossible because no events can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C2 cannot hold in the next state, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):
- The context says initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred (which it has initially), there are no subsequent events at all.
- C1 asserts that event2 happens. The context prevents any events after event1, so event2 does not happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires ""event1 happens and C1 holds."" Although event1 did happen initially, C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false (and no events occur in the next state), C3 is false.

Thus C3 is False."

- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Because event2 already happened initially, no events can occur after that point.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen (there is no time after the initial event2 when any event could occur), and there is no earlier time indicated when event1 could have happened before the initial event2. So event1 does not happen.

1. The question asks whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.
2. From the context: event2 has already happened initially, and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" Therefore no occurrence of event1 can take place at any time (event1 cannot happen after the initial event2).
3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is true, since event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
   - C2 (""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true: C1 is true and event2 does happen (it happened initially), so the conditional holds.
   - C3 requires event1 to happen (in addition to C2 holding). But event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
4. Also note C1 and C3 are directly contradictory (C1 asserts event1 does not happen; C3 asserts event1 does happen), so they cannot both be true.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true.

Step 1 — understand context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has already occurred at the start).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must follow).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur later. Reading ""initially, event2 happened"" as placing event2 at the start implies event1 did not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" C1 does hold, and event2 did happen (initially), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" We found C2 true but event1 does not happen (C1 true). Therefore the conjunction is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So nothing can occur after event1.)
- Therefore event2 does not occur (it would have to occur after event1, but no events can happen after event1).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is true given the context.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; since C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 is true, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are given:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

From ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen"" it follows that event2 cannot happen. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true, so C2 is true.

C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., the negation of C2). Because C2 is true, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
  Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is no indication event2 happened before the initial state, so event2 does not happen. Thus C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
  Since C1 is True, the disjunction is True. So C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
  C2 holds (is True), so its negation C3 is False.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 says ""C2 eventually holds.""
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and Event1 happens"" — which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
So C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens,"" and C3 asserts that eventually Event1 happens.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, no other events can happen (Event2 is terminal).
Therefore, no Event1 can occur at or after the initial moment.

Conclusion:
- Event1 never occurs, so C2 never holds, hence C3 does not eventually hold.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" reduces to just ""Event1 happens.""
2. C2 = ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" therefore also reduces to ""Event1 happens.""
3. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" means ""event1 happens at some point (eventually).""
4. Context: ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 occurs at the start and forbids any further events, event1 cannot occur at any time.
5. Therefore C3 (""event1 eventually happens"") is not satisfied.

Final: False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" So the question is: does C2 become true at some point (now or in the future)?

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"", C2 is also equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" is therefore equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Since event2 has already happened initially and no further events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur now or in the future.

Event1 does not eventually happen, so C3 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the question: C3 is the conjunction ""C2 holds AND event2 happens"". We must decide whether C3 is True or False given the context.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, no other events can happen.""
- From ""Initially, event2 happened"" we know event2 does occur.
- From ""After event2, no other events can happen"" there are no further events once event2 has occurred, so every reachable run/history contains event2 (it happened initially and nothing else happens afterwards).

Therefore:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true: event2 happens in the initial (and thus in all) histories.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 requires C2 to be true and event2 to happen. Although event2 does happen, C2 is false, so the conjunction C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 is the claim ""C2 holds and event2 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold.""
- C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 does happen).
- After event2 no other events can happen (so the execution is fixed: event2 occurs and then nothing else).
- The other constraint (""After event1, no other events can happen"") is irrelevant because event1 never occurs in this scenario.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Because event2 happens initially and there are no alternative executions where event2 does not occur, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 requires C2 to be true and event2 to happen. Although event2 does happen, C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The context fixes that initially event2 happened, so in every possible execution/event trace event2 occurs.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") therefore holds.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and event2 happens"". That is false ∧ true, which is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 asks whether ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" is true. Both C1 and C2 state the same thing: ""Event1 eventually happens."" So C3 is essentially asking whether Event1 eventually happens.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant once we know event2 happened first.)

Step 3 — reason about event sequences:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, Event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- There is no indication Event1 happened before the initial state; the initial event was event2, so Event1 did not happen previously.
- Therefore ""Event1 eventually happens"" is false (both C1 and C2 are false).

Step 4 — conclude about C3:
- C3 = C1 or C2 = false or false = false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- The hypothesis C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", where C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"" and C2 = ""Event1 eventually happens"". So C3 is simply ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, nothing else can occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 ever happened, it would also be terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Since event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1) can occur at any time.
- Therefore event1 does not and cannot eventually happen. So C1 is false and C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C3:
- C3 is ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1 or C2), which is false given the above.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 happened.
- Context: after event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has occurred (which it has initially), no further events — including event1 — can ever occur afterwards.
- C1 says ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e. event1 will occur at some point). That contradicts the previous point, so C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also false.
- C3 is the disjunction ""C1 or C2"", which is false if both C1 and C2 are false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Sample responses:
First: the hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- From the context, initially event2 happened, so E2 is true.
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" (E1 ∨ E2). Since E2 is true, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (E1 → C1). This is true for two reasons: (a) logically E1 → (E1 ∨ E2) is a tautology, and (b) here C1 is already true regardless of E1, so the implication holds.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. But we just established C2 does hold.

Therefore C3 is False.

False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Context says event2 happened initially (and both event1 and event2 are terminal: no further events can follow either).
2. C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event2 did happen, C1 is true.
3. C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is always true: if event1 happens then the disjunction (event1 or event2) is true; if event1 doesn't happen the implication is vacuously true. So C2 holds.
4. C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. Since C2 does hold, C3 is false.

Step 1 — identify what’s given:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 occurs, it is terminal.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs, it is terminal.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. Since event2 does happen, C1 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. An implication is true if the antecedent is false or the consequent is true.
- Here event1 does not happen (event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can occur, so event1 cannot occur). Thus the antecedent “event1 happens” is false, making the implication vacuously true. Also C1 is actually true anyway. Therefore C2 is True.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 states “C2 does not hold.” But we found C2 is True, so C3 is False.

The hypothesis asks whether C3 is true.

1. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred at the start.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur afterward — in particular, event2 cannot occur at any time after the start.
3. ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This condition would require event1 to occur following event2, but because no events can occur after the initial event1, event2 cannot occur at all. (There is no earlier time for event2; the start already has event1.)
4. Evaluate the conditions:

We are asked whether C3 is true given the context.

1) Context facts:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, nothing else can occur later.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.)

2) Consequences:
- Since event1 already occurred initially, the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" prevents any further events, so event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- Because event2 cannot occur, the conditional ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant (it never gets triggered), but it does not make event2 possible.

3) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True, because event1 does happen (initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" True (C1 already true, and event1 also happens).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Requires event2 to happen. But event2 cannot happen (see step 2). Therefore C3 is false.

First identify the question: it asks whether C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur after that — in particular, event2 cannot occur after event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen. This constraint is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (given the previous points), so it does not force any new events.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — True (event1 happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — True (C1 is true and event1 is true).

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the initial moment.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so the trace is terminal immediately after the initial event1.
- (The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur once event1 already happened and terminated the trace.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true because event1 has already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true right now, it holds at the current moment, so ""eventually C1"" is also true (it holds immediately).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 holds, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 has happened (so at the initial timepoint event1 is true).
- After event1 (and after event2) no further events can occur — both event1 and event2 are terminal when they occur.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Because event1 already happened initially, C1 is true (the eventuality is already satisfied).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds already at the initial time, ""eventually C1"" is also satisfied (eventually includes the present), so C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we found C2 is true, so the negation is false.

Final answer: False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 says ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point in the future there will be a time when C2 is true.

Step 2 — understand each condition:
- Context: event2 already happened (initially). After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event1 always happens — under the context, event1 is guaranteed to occur after the initial event2, so C1 holds (event1 will occur).
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens — this is the conjunction that event1 does (will) happen and that event2 has happened.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At time 0: event2 has happened.
- Sometime next: event1 must occur (by the rule).
- After event1 occurs, both facts are true: event1 has happened (so C1 is satisfied) and event2 has happened (it happened initially). Therefore C2 is true immediately after event1.

Step 4 — conclusion about C3:
- Because C2 becomes true after event1, C2 does eventually hold.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event2 occurred. The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” forces event1 to occur next. After event1 no further events occur. So the actual event sequence is event2 → event1, and then termination.

2. C1: “Event1 always happens.” Given the initial event2 and the obligation that event1 must follow event2, event1 does indeed happen in this run. So C1 holds.

3. C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” Both conjuncts are true (event2 happened initially and C1 holds), so C2 holds now.

4. C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 already holds at the current time, it holds at some time in the future (indeed immediately), so the “eventually” condition is satisfied.

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide if, given the context, C2 will be true at some point.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event2 occurred. After event2, event1 must occur. After event1, no further events can occur.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as “event1 inevitably occurs (in the given scenario).” Given the context, event1 must occur after the initial event2, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" We have event2 initially and C1 holds, so C2 is true (already true at the start).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 is already true at the initial moment, then it certainly holds at some time (immediately), so C3 is true.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Sequence: event2 (initial) → event1 (must happen) → nothing else. Both event2 and event1 occur in this run, so C1 and C2 hold immediately.

Conclusion
- C3 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Understand the statements:
- Initially event2 has happened (at the current state).
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur at some later state.
- After event1 occurs, no further events (neither event1 nor event2) can occur.

2. Interpret the Cs:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. at the immediate successor).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. at every state, event2 happens in that state's next state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e. at the immediate successor state, it is true that C1 holds everywhere thereafter).

3. Reason about possible runs given the constraints:
- Since event2 occurred initially, a later event1 must occur (by the second rule).
- When that event1 occurs, no events happen afterwards; hence from the state where event1 has just happened, the next state does not have event2.
- Therefore at the state where event1 has just happened, C1 is false (its next state lacks event2). So C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false at that state.

4. Conclusion about C3:
- Because event1 must eventually occur after the initial event2, there is a successor state (the state right after that event1) where C2 is false. Therefore C2 does not necessarily hold in the next state of the initial state, so C3 is false.
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C3 asserts: ""In the next state, C2 holds."" C2 says ""C1 always holds."" C1 says ""Event2 happens in the next state."" So C3 claims that in the next state it is true that, from that point onward, in every state the next state contains event2.

Step 2 — Interpret the context rules
- Initially, event2 has happened (we are at a state where event2 just occurred).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So immediately following any state where event2 occurs, the next state must have event1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs the execution terminates (no further events after that state).

Step 3 — Evaluate C1, C2, C3
- From the rules, since event2 happened in the current (initial) state, the next state must have event1 (not event2). Therefore C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") requires C1 to be true in every state; because C1 is already false here, C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") asks whether C2 is true in the next state. The next state contains event1 and no further events are possible, so C1 is not true there and C2 is not true there. Therefore C3 is false.

Sample responses:
First identify what is asked: C3 states ""C2 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Since C1 is false, C2 is true right away.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is already true in the current (initial) state, it certainly holds at some time (immediately), so C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
C3 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no further events can occur. Also if event1 happens, event2 must follow.
- C1 (event2 happens in the next state): False, because once event2 has happened no further events (including event2 again) can occur in the next state.
- C2 (if C1 holds then event1 happens): This implication is true in the initial state because its antecedent C1 is false (a false antecedent makes the implication true vacuously).
- C3 (C2 eventually holds): True, because C2 already holds in the initial state, so it certainly holds at some (in fact the current) time in the future.

Therefore C3 is True.

Step 1 — what is asked:
C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Context: initially event1 happened (so ""Event1 happens"" is true at least at the start). Also events alternate thereafter, so event1 does occur.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just ""Event1 happens"" (redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"", C2 is also equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 3 — conclude:
Given the context (event1 did happen initially and continues to occur), C2 holds, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False

Goal: determine truth of C3 (""C2 does not hold"").

Step 1 — understand context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So event1 does occur (at the start), and the sequence alternates event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"". Given the context, Event1 does happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 is True (and Event1 also happens), C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — this asserts the negation of C2. But C2 is True, so C3 is False.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what's asked:
- C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold."" We must determine whether C3 is True or False given the context and the definitions.

Step 2 — simplify and examine conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""
- From the context, ""Initially, event1 happened."" So C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is True (and ""Event1 happens"" is also true from the context), C2 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. But we've established C2 is True, so C3 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C3 is the proposition “C2 does not hold.” We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context and definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.”
- C2: “C1 does not hold” → equivalently, “Event1 does happen.”
- C3: “C2 does not hold” → equivalently, “Event1 does not happen” (same as C1).

Step 3 — use the context
The context states “Initially, event1 happened.” Therefore Event1 did happen. That makes:
- C1 false (since it says event1 does not happen),
- C2 true (it asserts C1 does not hold),
- C3 false (it asserts C2 does not hold).

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context, event1 happened initially. So the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.

2. C2 states ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

3. C3 states ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 is true, so ""C2 does not hold"" is false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event1 happened. So ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened. So event1 occurs at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, the run stops (no further events).
- (The “after event2 …” clause is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" That is true: event1 happens initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting this as ""at every point in the execution, event1 will eventually happen"" (i.e. G(F event1) in temporal logic). For that to be true, event1 would have to occur again in the future from every state. But after the initial event1 there are no further events, so from the states after event1 there is no future occurrence of event1. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C2.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1 no other events can happen. (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 cannot occur because event1 already happened and blocks further events.)
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, event1 happens immediately (initially), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means: in every reachable state along the system’s execution, C1 (that event1 eventually happens) is true.

Step 3 — trace possible states
- The only reachable situation is the initial state in which event1 has happened and any subsequent states where no further events occur.
- In every reachable state the fact ""event1 happened"" holds (it happened initially), so the condition ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied in all states (the occurrence is already true in the present or past and thus the eventuality is satisfied).

Step 4 — conclude about C2 and C3
- Therefore C2 holds (C1 is true in every reachable state).
- C3, which asserts ""C2 does not hold,"" is false.

- We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened. Therefore ""event1 does not happen"" is false.
- From the context, after event1 event2 must happen, so ""event2 happens"" is true (at least at some later time).

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — false (because C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" — false or true, which is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 is (C2 holds) OR (event2 happens). We need to determine whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also: after event1, event2 must happen; and after event2, event1 must happen. So event2 is required to occur at some point after the initial event1.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 did happen initially). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Because C1 is false, C2 is false (a conjunction with a false conjunct is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" With C2 false, C3 reduces to whether event2 happens.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
Since event1 happened initially and the rules require that after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does in fact happen.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because event2 happens, C3 (C2 or event2) is true.

Final answer: True

- The hypothesis asks whether C3 is true.

Step 2 — examine each condition:

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (false AND anything = false).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" because C2 is false.

Step 3 — trace events from the context:
- Event1 occurred initially.
- The rules say that after event1, event2 must happen — therefore event2 does happen.
- (After event2, event1 must happen again, but that’s not needed beyond establishing event2 happens.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C3 asks whether ""C2 always holds"" is true (i.e., at every point in time C2 holds).

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 has happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, event1 must follow).
  - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Conditions:

  - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (at every time, event2 will eventually happen).
  - C3: ""C2 always holds"" (at every time, C2 holds).

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequences
- Because initially event1 has already happened and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" the system cannot perform any further events. In particular, event2 can never occur in any future of the initial state.

We want to decide whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.

1) Restate the context:
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- If event2 happens then event1 must happen afterwards.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

2) Evaluate C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no further events (including event2) can ever occur. So event2 cannot eventually happen.
- Therefore C1 is false.

3) Evaluate C2: ""C1 always holds.""
- C1 is false at the initial (and only) reachable point, so ""always C1"" is false.
- Therefore C2 is false.

4) Evaluate C3: ""C2 always holds.""
- Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds."" We must decide whether this is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- Rule: after event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e., every occurrence of event2 must be followed by an event1).
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context: because event1 already happened initially and after any event1 no further events can happen, no future events (including event2) can occur. So event2 cannot happen → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false in the actual execution, the claim that C1 always holds is false.

Answer being asked: Is C3 true or false?

Step-by-step:
1. From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 cannot happen (it would be ""after event2"", which is forbidden).
2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 cannot happen in any allowed scenario, the implication is vacuously true. So C1 holds.
3. C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 holds, so C2 is true.
4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must determine the truth of C3 (""C2 does not hold"") given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — Facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → therefore event1 does not happen (no further events after event2).
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen (not needed here because event1 does not occur).

Step 3 — Evaluate C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- Event2 did happen, and moreover event1 does not happen. In classical logic the conditional is true when the consequent is true or when the antecedent is false. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""
- Since C1 holds, the disjunction is true. So C2 is true.

Step 5 — Evaluate C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
- C2 holds, so ""C2 does not hold"" is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur later.
- After event1, no other events can happen (but this is moot if event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the actual situation event1 cannot happen (because event2 already happened and prevents any further events). A conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Also, independently, event2 has occurred, so the conditional is satisfied. Thus C1 holds (is true).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 happens. So C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we just determined C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C3 is the statement ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace events
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees that event1 does happen (at some point after the initial event2).
- After event1 no other events can happen, but that does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): given the initial event2 and the rule, event1 does indeed occur, so C1 holds in this scenario.
- C2 (""C1 always holds""): since C1 holds in the system described, C2 is also satisfied (whether by the same reasoning or because nothing in the scenario can invalidate C1).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3 is ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" We already know event1 happens, so the disjunction is true regardless of C2.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what C3 asks:
- C3 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" So C3 is true if at least one of (C2 is true) or (event1 happens) is true.

Step 2 — what the context gives:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore, in the actual sequence given, event1 does happen.
- After event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant for the disjunction except to note the sequence ends after event1).

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since event1 happens in the given context, the disjunction ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" is true regardless of whether C2 holds.

We ask whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Step 1 — restate the constraints
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event2 requires a subsequent occurrence of event1).

Step 2 — consequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and it forbids any later events, no event2 can ever occur after the initial state.
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" That requires event2 to happen, which is impossible given the terminal event1, so C1 is false in all reachable futures.
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never holds, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- The question asks whether C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true given the context.
- Context: initially event1 has happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. And if event2 happens, event1 must happen after it.
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time (it cannot occur before the initial event1, and it cannot occur after).
- C1 requires event2 to happen (together with event1). Since event2 can never happen, C1 can never hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false, and so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 states: ""C2 always holds."" C2 says: ""C1 eventually holds."" And C1 says: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- So C3 claims: at every point in the execution, it is true that eventually both event2 and event1 will occur.

Step 2 — understand the context constraints
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That forbids any events occurring after that initial event1 (so event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur given the second rule.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- The initial event1 has occurred and then no further events can happen. Therefore event2 can never occur in any continuation of the system starting from the given initial condition.
- Since event2 never occurs, C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is false in every reachable state (event1 is true but event2 is false).
- Consequently, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false (there is no future point where both events will occur).
- Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C3 is true.

Summary reasoning (no hidden chain-of-thought):
- From the context: initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time.
- C1 requires both event1 and event2 → false (event2 impossible).
- C2 is ""C1 or event2"" → false.
- C3 is ""C2 and event2"" → false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event2 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" = (event1 and event2) or event2 = event2. So C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C3 = ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" = event2 and event2 = event2. So C3 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".

So the problem reduces to: does event2 happen under the given context?

Step 3 — use the context to see whether event2 can happen
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no events (including event2) can occur after the initial event1.
- The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” does not force event2 to occur; it only constrains what must follow if event2 were to occur.
- There is no information that event2 happened before the initial event1; ""initially event1 happened"" implies event1 is already the starting event, so event2 cannot have happened earlier.

Conclusion
Event2 does not happen, so C3 (equivalent to ""event2 happens"") is False.

False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C3 = C2 holds AND event2 happens.
- C2 = (C1) OR event2.
- C1 = event1 happens AND event2 happens.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true (it already occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no further events can occur at any time.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen (event2 is false).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 = event1 AND event2 = true AND false = false.
- C2 = C1 OR event2 = false OR false = false.
- C3 = C2 AND event2 = false AND false = false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1 is just “event2” (event2 ∧ event2 is equivalent to event2).
   - C2 is “eventually C1”, i.e. eventually event2 holds (in the present or some future state).
   - C3 is “in the next state, C2 holds”, i.e. from the next state there will be some (current-or-future) state where event2 holds.

2. Use the given constraints to build a valid trace:
   - Initially (time 0) event2 happens (given).
   - After event2, event1 must happen, so put event1 at time 1.
   - After event1 no other events can happen, so no events occur at times ≥ 2.

   This trace satisfies all constraints.

3. Evaluate C3 at the initial state:
   - C3 requires that at time 1 (the next state) there is some time ≥1 where event2 holds.
   - In the constructed trace there is no event2 at time 1 or any later time (event1 occurred at time 1 and then no further events).
   - Therefore C2 is false at time 1, so C3 is false at the initial state.

Because a trace consistent with the premises makes C3 false, C3 is not necessarily true. Hence the answer is False.
---

---
Step 1 — clarify the operators and initial facts
- Initially (state S0) event2 has happened.  
- “After event2, event1 must happen” means the next transition after S0 produces event1.  
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means once event1 has occurred there are no further events (the future is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is just that event2 happens; in S0 this is true, so C1 holds in S0.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” From S0 this is true (because C1 already holds at S0).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” We must check whether C2 is true in the state S1 immediately after S0.

Step 3 — examine S1 (the next state)
- By the context, the next state S1 is after event1 has happened. After event1 no further events occur, so in the future from S1, event2 will not happen again.
- C2 is “eventually C1” where C1 requires event2 to happen. Since from S1’s future event2 will not occur, C1 will not be true at any point in the future of S1, so C2 is false in S1.

Conclusion
- C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the statement ""C1 holds or C2 holds"".
- Both C1 and C2 are the same claim: ""Event1 always happens"".
So C3 is true exactly when ""Event1 always happens"" is true.

Step 2 — interpret the context constraints
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — so whenever event2 has occurred, event1 is required to occur later.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1, if it occurs, is terminal (nothing can follow it).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- The initial fact is that event2 has happened. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 must occur at some future point.
- That event1 occurrence is compatible with ""after event1 no other events can happen"" (it simply ends the sequence). There is no rule preventing event1 from occurring, and no alternative that allows skipping it because it's required after event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In every possible execution consistent with the constraints, event1 occurs (because event2 occurred initially and forces event1).
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true, so ""C1 or C2"" (C3) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal but does not prevent itself from occurring.)
- Hypothesis parts: C1 = ""Event1 always happens."" C2 = ""Event1 always happens."" (C1 and C2 are the same statement.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Since event2 happened initially and Rule A requires that after event2 event1 must happen, event1 will occur in every valid sequence starting from the given initial condition.
- Rule B does not prevent event1 from occurring; it only stops further events after event1.

Step 4 — conclude about C1, C2, C3
- C1 is true (event1 always happens given the context). C2 is the same, so it is also true.
- Therefore C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the claim “C1 holds or C2 holds.” Both C1 and C2 assert the same thing: “Event1 always happens.” So C3 is true exactly when “Event1 always happens” is true.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so any run that has event2 must include event1 afterwards).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal but not forbidden).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Since event2 happened initially, by Rule A event1 must occur at some point after that.
- When event1 occurs, Rule B merely prevents further events; it does not prevent event1 itself from occurring.
- There is no rule that can stop event1 from happening after event2. So in every possible sequence given the context and rules, event1 does occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (and thus C2) is true, so C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is false because initially event2 already happened and the premise ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids any event (including event2) from occurring in the next state.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That would mean that in the next state, event2 happens in the following state. But because no events can happen after the initial event2, C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" The antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously true).

Therefore C3 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the three background facts.

Step 2 — understand the background
- Initially (state 0) event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in every later state no events occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At state 0 the next state is state 1. Because no events can happen after the initial event2, event2 does not happen in state 1. So C1 is false at state 0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C1 is true in state 1. But C1 at state 1 would say ""event2 happens in state 2"", which is false (no events occur after the initial event2). So C2 is false at state 0.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C2 is false in the initial state, the implication C2 → event1 is vacuously true.

True

- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just the same disjunction twice, so C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 does happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is True.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C3 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What is asked
You are asked whether C3 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 does happen (at least once after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → they alternate, but the key is event1 does occur.

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"". Given the context, event1 does happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2. Since C2 is False, C3 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (tautological repetition).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not(C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not(C2) = not(not(C1)) = C1. So C3 is equivalent to C1.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rules say: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- Given event2 happened initially and ""must happen"" indicates the required events occur, event1 will (and therefore does) happen after the initial event2.

Step 3 — conclude truth values:
- C1 (Event1 happens) is true.
- C2 (not C1) is false.
- C3 (not C2) is therefore true (and equivalent to C1).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the claims
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, event1 already happened and event2 is guaranteed to happen afterward, so C1 will become true once event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" C2 requires that at every time point C1 is true. Before event2 occurs, C1 is false (event2 has not yet happened), so C2 is false initially. However, once event2 occurs, both events have happened and, because no further events can happen, the truth of ""event1 happened and event2 happened"" persists at all future times. Thus from the moment after event2 occurs, C2 becomes true (holds globally from then on).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since event2 must occur at some point after event1, there is a time after which C2 holds (as just argued). Therefore C2 does indeed eventually hold.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.
---

---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 is the claim ""C2 eventually holds"". We must decide whether that statement is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (both events occur at some point).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (from that moment on, C1 is true at all times).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (at some future time, C2 becomes true).
Context:
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (state is terminal once event2 occurs).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- At the initial moment: event1 has happened but event2 has not yet — so C1 is false initially.
- Because ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will occur at some future time.
- When event2 occurs, both event1 and event2 have happened, so C1 becomes true at that moment.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so the situation (both events have happened) persists forever. Thus from the moment event2 occurs, C1 holds at all future times — that is, C2 holds from that moment onward.

Step 4 — conclusion
- There is a future time (the time when event2 occurs) at which C2 becomes true, so ""C2 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 asserts that C1 and C2 both hold.
- C1 and C2 each claim ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens"" (they are identical).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after Event1, no other events can happen — but that is irrelevant unless Event1 happens.)

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences:
- Since Event2 has already happened and no events can occur after Event2, Event1 cannot occur after Event2.
- The context does not state Event1 happened before or simultaneously with Event2; the only guaranteed event is Event2.
- Therefore we cannot conclude Event1 happens. So ""Event2 and Event1 happen"" (C1) is false. Same for C2.

Step 4 — conclude about C3:
- C3 requires C1 and C2 to be true; both are false, so C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
C3 asserts that C1 holds and C2 holds. C1 and C2 each assert ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" So C3 requires both event2 and event1 to have happened.

Step 2 — apply the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 has happened (initially), no other event can occur afterward — in particular, event1 cannot occur after event2.
- There is no information that event1 happened before event2 or simultaneously; given the usual reading, event1 does not happen.

Step 3 — conclude about C1/C2 and C3:
Because event1 cannot occur once event2 has happened, C1 (and thus C2) is false. Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 = same as C1.
- C3 = ""C1 holds and C2 holds"", so C3 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context constraints:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — consider possibilities for both events to occur:
- If event1 happened before event2, then ""after event1 no other events can happen"" would forbid event2 — but event2 did happen initially, contradiction.
- If event1 happened after event2, then ""after event2 no other events can happen"" forbids event1 — contradiction.
- Simultaneous occurrence is not allowed by the given ""after"" constraints (and would still conflict with the mutual ""no other events"" rules).

Conclusion:
- It is impossible for both event2 and event1 to hold together given the context. Therefore C3 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial time point event2 has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no further events in any future state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 were to occur, event2 would have to occur afterward).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false (and there are no future events that could make it true), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Both conjuncts fail: C2 is false and event1 does not happen. Hence C3 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 has already happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no future events can occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 must subsequently occur).

Step 3 — analyze each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any future point. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false now and no events can occur in the next state either (because we're already past event2), C1 does not hold in the next state; C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" This requires both C2 true and event1 to happen. We have C2 false, and event1 cannot happen (as noted above). Thus C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C3 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and event1 happens.""
- We must decide whether that conjunction can be true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system is in a terminal state where no further events, including event1, can occur).
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen — this rule is irrelevant if event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate the components
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given that after the initial event2 no further events can occur, event1 cannot ever happen, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the terminal state reached by event2, and in any case event1 cannot ever happen after event2, so C1 does not hold in the next state — C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Both conjuncts are false (C2 is false; event1 does not happen), so C3 is false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initial state S0: event2 happened. Also, ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means S0 has no successor state (no further events possible). ""After event1, no other events can happen"" similarly makes any state where event1 occurs terminal.

- C1 = (event2 happens and event1 happens). At S0 event2 is true but event1 is not; there is no indication event1 also happened (and no further events can occur afterwards), so C1 is false in S0.

- C2 = (C1 holds in the next state). There is no next state after S0 (because event2 makes the state terminal), so ""next C1"" is false.

- C3 = (C2 holds in the next state). Since there is no next state in which to evaluate C2, C3 is also false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The hypothesis asks whether C3 is true. C3 states: ""C2 holds in the next state."" And C2 states: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 states: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

2. From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and similarly after event1 no other events can happen). So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur in any later state.

3. Therefore C1 (""event2 and event1 happen"") is false in the initial state (only event2 happened) and cannot become true in any subsequent state because event1 cannot happen after event2.

4. Since C1 never holds in the next state, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false. Consequently, C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is also false.

Thus C3 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context says initially event2 happened. Also, ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has happened (which is true initially), there are no subsequent events in any later state.
- C1 = (event2 and event1). In the initial state event2 is true, but event1 is not stated to have happened initially; and because event2 prevents any later events, event1 cannot occur in any later state either. Hence there is no state in which both event2 and event1 hold together; C1 is false in every state.
- C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is false in every state, C2 is false.
- C3 asserts C2 holds in the next state. Because C2 is false, C3 is also false.

Therefore C3 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
C3 asserts: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology and therefore true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" So C3 requires that whenever event2 happens, event1 (and thus C2) also happens.

Step 3 — use the context / trace events
The context says: ""Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen."" Because event2 happens initially and prevents any further events, event1 cannot happen at any point after (and there is no indication it happened before). Therefore ""event1 happens"" is false, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C3
The antecedent of C3 (""event2 happens"") is true (it happens initially), but the consequent C2 is false. So the implication ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What is asked
We must decide whether C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true exactly when event1 happens.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" So C3 requires that whenever event2 happens, C2 is true (i.e., event1 must also happen).

Step 3 — Use the context about events
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore, once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward.
- There is no indication event1 happened earlier; given the initial occurrence of event2 and the ""no other events"" constraint, event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — Combine facts
- Event1 does not happen, so C2 (which requires event1) is false.
- Because event2 does happen but C2 is false, the implication in C3 (antecedent true, consequent false) is false.

Final answer:
False

- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 holds, C2 is true exactly when event1 happens.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" So C3 requires that whenever event2 happens, C2 (and thus event1) holds.

Step 3 — use the context about events:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event1 cannot happen after event2).
- Also after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant since event1 did not occur).

Because event2 already happened initially and prevents any other events, event1 does not happen. Therefore C2 is false (C1 true but event1 false). Since event2 does happen but C2 does not hold, the implication in C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify what's asked: C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes event1 terminal; nothing can happen after it (so event2 cannot occur later).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Not needed here because event2 does not occur after event1.)

Evaluate the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" This is true because event1 has already happened.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now, it certainly holds eventually — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This negates a true statement (C2), so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred.
2. It also says ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore nothing else (including event2) can occur after that initial event.
3. C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") is true because event1 has happened.
4. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true as well, since C1 already holds (so it holds now and hence eventually).
5. C3 (""C2 does not hold"") contradicts step 4, so C3 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 claims: ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether that claim is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially, event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (and likewise after event2 no other events can happen).
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some time C1 is true)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (negation of C2)

Step 3 — trace the timeline
- At the initial moment event1 has happened, so C1 is already true (because event1 happened).
- Therefore C1 holds at that time, so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied (C2 is true).
- Because C2 is true, the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is false.

- After event1, no other events can happen — therefore in every state after the initial one, no events occur (in particular event2 never occurs anywhere after the initial state).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (X event2) is false at the initial state because the next state cannot have any events (so event2 cannot happen there).
- Because no events ever occur after the initial state, there is no future state at which C1 becomes true. So C2 (""eventually C1"") is false.
- Since C2 is never true at any future point, C3 (""eventually C2"") is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (a property about the immediate successor of a state)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there is some future state where C1 is true)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (there is some future state where C2 is true)
We must decide whether C3 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (in the initial state) event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from that state onward, neither event2 nor any other events can occur).
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- Because the initial state has event1 and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur in any future state.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false in every state reachable from the initial state.
- Since C1 is never true, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
- Since C2 is never true, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C3 is the claim ""C2 eventually holds.""

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the system is forever stuck; no event, including event2, can ever occur afterwards).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the initial state already has event1 and no events can happen after event1, C1 is false in the initial state and can never become true at any future state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That requires some future state from which event2 happens in its next state. Because no events (including event2) can ever occur after the initial event1, there is no such future state, so C2 is false everywhere.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 never holds at any time, it cannot ever be made true in the future; therefore C3 is false.

False"

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true given the context.
- Context: initially event2 has happened; after event2 no other events can happen. Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never gets the chance.
- C1 is ""event1 eventually happens."" Because event2 has already occurred and no further events can occur, event1 can never occur. So C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — this is just another way of saying event1 eventually happens (F event1). Since C1 is false now and at every future point (no events will occur), C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" (F(F event1)). Because C2 is never true at any future point, C3 is also false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened, and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" makes event2 terminal.
- Therefore event1 can never occur. So C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.
- If C1 is false at all times, then C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false, and consequently C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- (Also note in temporal logic F F φ ≡ F φ, so the nested ""eventually"" formulas are equivalent.)
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = F(C1) = F(F event1) which is equivalent to F event1.
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" = F(C2) = F(F event1) which again is equivalent to F event1.
The hypothesis asks whether C3 is true.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened (so at the start event2 has already occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur (event2 already occurred and forbids further events).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event2 has already happened and prevents any further events, event1 never happens. Thus F event1 is false.
- Therefore C1, C2, and C3 (all equivalent to F event1) are false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the claim
- C3 says: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., in every state C2 is true).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after any state with event2 has event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so events alternate each step).

So the state sequence of events is: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ... (alternating forever).

Step 3 — Examine C1, C2, C3
- C1 at a state x: ""event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., event1 holds at x+1).
  At s0, C1 is true because s1 has event1.
- C2 at a state x: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., at x+1, C1 must be true, equivalently event1 must hold at x+2.
  At s0, C2 asks whether event1 holds at s2. But s2 has event2, so C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" requires C2 to be true in every state. But we have already found a state (s0) where C2 is false.

Conclusion
- C3 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initial state (call it state0): event2 happened.
- Given the rules:
  - After event2, event1 must happen → state1 has event1.
  - After event1, event2 must happen → state2 has event2.
  - This yields an alternating sequence: state0: e2, state1: e1, state2: e2, state3: e1, ...

Now evaluate the claims at the initial state:

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" True at state0, because state1 has event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This means that at state1, C1 is true — i.e., event1 should happen at state2. But state2 has event2, so C1 is false at state1; therefore C2 is false at state0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 is not true globally.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the conditions:
- Initially (state s0) event2 occurs.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" force alternation of events on successive states.

Step 2 — trace the states:
- s0: event2 (given)
- s1: event1 (because after event2 → event1)
- s2: event2 (after event1 → event2)
- s3: event1, and so on (alternating).

Step 3 — examine the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 this is true (s1 is event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" i.e. at s0 this requires that C1 is true at s1 — equivalently, event1 must occur at s2. But s2 is event2, so C1 is false at s1; therefore C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" would require C2 to be true at every state. We already found C2 false at s0, so C3 cannot hold.

Step 1 — what’s asked
C3 asserts that C2 ""always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 does occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, event2 does happen, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication (event2) → (event2 does not happen). Since event2 does happen and C1 is false, the implication is false (true antecedent, false consequent).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false (it fails when event2 occurs), C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
- The question: is C3 (""C2 always holds"") true or false given the context?

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen (and after event2 nothing else can happen).

- Evaluate C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 does happen).

- Evaluate C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication (event2) → (event2 does not happen). Since event2 does happen and C1 is false, the implication is false.

- C3 asserts that C2 always holds. But C2 is false in the actual run, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False

Answer: False

Brief justification:
- From the context, event1 happened and ""after event1, event2 must happen"", so event2 does happen.
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is false because event2 does happen but C1 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C3 is the statement ""Event1 happens and C2 holds.""
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold.""
- C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

So C3 is equivalent to: ""Event1 happens AND (Event1 does not eventually happen).""

Step 2 — examine each condition and the context:
- The context states: initially, event1 happened. That means Event1 does happen (already occurred).
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true (the occurrence already satisfies “eventually”).
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Step 3 — logical consequence:
- C3 requires both Event1 happens (true) and C2 holds (false). That makes C3 false (a conjunction with a false conjunct is false).
- Also C3 is self-contradictory in its internal content (it asserts Event1 happens and simultaneously asserts Event1 does not eventually happen).

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify: C3 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens and C2 holds.""

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- From the context, Event1 happens initially, so C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", therefore C2 is false (negation of a true statement).

Step 3 — combine for C3:
- C3 requires Event1 (true) AND C2 (false). A conjunction with a false conjunct is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: C3 states ""C2 does not hold."" We must determine whether that statement is true or false given the context.

2. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   - (Also) after event1, no other events can happen.

   ""Initially event2 happened"" means event2 has occurred at the start, so there is no earlier time at which event1 could have occurred. And because event2 has happened, no subsequent events (including event1) can occur.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is true.
   - C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event1 never happens at any time, C1 is always true; thus C2 is true.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 does hold, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False.
---
Step 1 — what C3 says:
- C3 is the claim ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not true that C1 always holds).

Step 2 — examine given facts:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 never happens at any time. So C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- Since C1 is true at all times, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. But we have C2 true, so C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The context states that initially event2 happened, and that after event2 no other events can happen. So from the initial point onward, no events (including event1) can occur.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no further events can occur, event1 indeed does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event1 never happens at any time (because nothing can happen after the initial event2), C1 is true at all times — hence C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we just established C2 is true, so the statement that C2 does not hold is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's being asked:
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is true or false given the initial constraints.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true iff Event1 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 is true iff C2 is false, i.e., iff Event1 does happen.

Step 3 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does happen.
- (The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event1 from occurring; it only restricts subsequent events.)

Step 4 — conclude truth values:
- Event1 happens → C1 is true.
- C1 true → C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
- C2 false → C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" (equivalent to: Event1 happens)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (equivalent to: Event1 does not happen)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (equivalent to: not (Event1 does not happen) → Event1 happens)

So C3 is equivalent to C1: it asserts that Event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. → this forces event1 to occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. → this just makes event1 terminal; it does not prevent event1 from occurring after event2.

Step 3 — trace events:
- event2 occurs initially.
- by the rule, event1 must happen after event2, so event1 does happen.

Therefore C1 is true, C2 is false, and C3 (which is equivalent to C1) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold.""
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold.""
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" (which is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens"").

So C3 is logically equivalent to C1 (double negation): C3 ↔ C1.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Rule: After event2, event1 must happen. So because event2 has occurred, event1 must occur at some point.
- Rule: After event1, no other events can happen — this only restricts what happens after event1, it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — combine
- From the context, event1 must happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

- We are asked whether C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 occurs first, and no events occur after it.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., either event2 does not happen, or event1 happens)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (negation of C2)

Step 3 — evaluate
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur at any later time. Given the framing (""Initially, event1 happened""), there is no earlier time for event2 to have occurred, so event2 does not happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is true (and event1 also happened), so C2 is true.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. But since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Final answer:
False"
