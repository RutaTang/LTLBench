Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts at event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Therefore the only possible infinite execution is an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (Note: this phrase is ambiguous; two useful readings are:)
  - Reading A (strict): ""event2 holds at every time point"" — i.e. at every step in the execution, event2 occurs.
  - Reading B (liveness): ""event2 occurs in every execution (e.g. infinitely often or eventually after event1).""
- C2: stated identical to C1 in your text (so same ambiguity).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally: C1 → C2.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- First, because C1 and C2 are the same statement as written, C3 is a logical tautology: for any proposition P, P → P is always true. So C3 is True regardless of whether C1 (and C2) is true or false.
- Second, about the truth of C1/C2 under the system:
  - Under Reading A (event2 at every time point): C1 is false, because at the steps where event1 happens, event2 does not hold simultaneously.
  - Under Reading B (event2 occurs in every execution / infinitely often): C1 is true, because starting from event1 the system alternates and event2 does occur (repeatedly).
- In either case, C3 remains True (tautologically) because it is of the form P → P.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C3 is of the form P → P (C1 and C2 are the same proposition), which is a tautology and therefore always true."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, the next state must have event2).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; there are no further events/transitions after a state where event2 occurs).

Given the initial state already has event2, rule B means there are no subsequent states/events after the initial state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (This is a claim about the immediate successor state.)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: (event1 → C1). This is an implication evaluated at some state: if event1 holds in that state, then event1 must hold in the next state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" There exists a (current or future) state in which C2 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is their truth value here?
- Because the initial state has event2 and rule B disallows any further events, event1 never occurs in any state.
- Evaluate C1 at the initial state: it claims event1 in the next state. There is no next state (or, equivalently, event1 does not occur in any next state), so C1 is false at the initial state.
- Evaluate C2 at the initial state: C2 is an implication ""if event1 then C1"". Its antecedent (event1) is false in the initial state, so the implication is vacuously true. Therefore C2 holds in the initial state.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is satisfied immediately because C2 already holds in the initial state. Therefore C3 is True.

(If one uses different semantics for terminal states, the key point stays the same: because event1 never occurs, the implication in C2 is vacuously true somewhere immediately, so C3 is true.)

Short answer: C3 is False (under the natural reading that once event1 has happened, no events happen thereafter).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — meaning once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur in subsequent states.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" — if event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterward. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 under the first rule.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., not C2).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Logically, C3 = not(C2) = not(not(C1)) = C1, so C3 is equivalent to C1.
- Given the transition rule and the initial event1, no events occur in the next state, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (not C1) is true, and C3 (not C2) is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False. (If you meant a different reading of ""no other events"" that allows event1 to repeat, then C1 and therefore C3 could be true; state that interpretation if you intended it.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C3 is equivalent to C1 (double negation). Given that event1 has already happened and no events can occur afterwards, event1 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false and thus C3 is false."

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state after event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (any occurrence of event1 is followed by event2 at some later point).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (identical to C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" i.e. (event2 eventually happens) OR (event2 eventually happens). Logically C3 is the same as C1 (and C2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C3 is equivalent to C1 (and to C2).
- Given the initial condition that event2 has already happened, the natural reading of ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (the occurrence has already occurred at the initial time), so C1 = True and C2 = True, hence C3 = True.
- Note on semantics: if you interpret ""eventually"" to mean ""at some strictly later time (not including the current/initial state)"", then because no events can occur after event2, event2 does not occur strictly later, so C1 and C2 would be False and thus C3 would be False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened already.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So given the initial condition, event2 will occur at some point.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This only says nothing happens after event2; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., it is not the case that event2 never occurs; equivalently, event2 does occur at least once.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some time in the future C2 becomes true.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and the fact event1 already happened, event2 will occur. Therefore C1 (""event2 never occurs"") is false.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is true (event2 does occur).
- C2 is already true from the start (it is a global fact about the timeline), so ""C2 eventually holds"" is also true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True — event1 has occurred and requires event2 to happen, so event2 will occur (C2 true), hence C2 eventually holds (C3 true)."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state 0), event1 happened.

(Assumption: one state transition at a time and at most one event occurs per state unless stated otherwise.)

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state.
- After event2 occurs, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" — i.e., in state1 (the state immediately after the initial state), event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" — true if either event1 occurs in state1, or event2 occurs in state1 (or both).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" — true if either C2 is true, or event1 happens (presumably in the same considered next state).

4) How they relate (evaluate them)
- From the rules, because event1 happened in the initial state, the next state must contain event2. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state; event2 does).
  - event2 does happen in the next state, so C2 = (C1 or event2) is true.
  - C3 = (C2 or event1) is therefore true (because C2 is true).

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
So once event1 or event2 occurs, the system has no further events afterwards.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — both events occur.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some point in the future (possibly the present) both events occur.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — either C2 is true, or event1 happens (or both).

4) How they relate (reasoning)
- event1 has already happened initially.
- Because ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no further events can occur after that initial moment. In particular, event2 cannot occur later.
- Therefore, both-event condition C1 does not become true (unless you allow event2 to also have happened at the exact same initial moment — see note below). Under the standard reading, C1 is false.
- C2 (""eventually C1"") is false because C1 will never become true.
- C3 is C2 OR event1. event1 is true (given), so C3 is true regardless of C2.

Conclusion: Under the usual interpretation, C3 is True.

Note on edge case: If one allows event2 to have occurred simultaneously with event1 at the initial instant (i.e., both happened initially), then C1 would be true, C2 true, and C3 still true. Either way, C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True under the most natural reading of the three statements. Below is a step-by-step explanation and a note about an alternate reading that would change the result.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- So the states alternate: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ….

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted as a propositional implication p -> p (with p = “event2 holds in this state”). That formula is a tautology: it is true in every state (whether event2 holds or not).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That means C1 is true in every state (globally). Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That means in the state immediately after the current one, C2 is true. Because C2 holds in every state, it certainly holds in the next state as well.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because C1 is a tautology, C2 (the global/always claim about C1) is true. Therefore C3, which asserts that C2 is true in the next state, is also true.

Conclusion: Under the plain reading where C1 is the state-level tautology (event2 -> event2), C3 is True.

Alternate reading (important caveat):
- If instead C1 was intended as a temporal statement like ""if event2 holds now, then event2 holds in the next state"" (i.e. event2 -> X event2), then C1 is false at states where event2 holds (because after event2 we get event1, not event2). In that reading C1 is false somewhere, C2 (""always C1"") is false, and C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false. So the truth of C3 depends on whether C1 is read as the trivial same-state implication p -> p (true) or a temporal implication relating different states (false).

Step-by-step:

So once either event1 or event2 occurs the system has no further events.

- C2: same as C1 (it says the same thing), so C2 is also satisfied.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — the disjunction of the two identical statements.

(Quick note on ""eventually"": we interpret ""eventually"" to include the present moment — i.e., if event2 already holds now, then ""event2 eventually happens"" is true. This is the standard interpretation in temporal logics like LTL where F p allows p at the current time.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 are both true (they assert the same fact and that fact holds in the initial state).
- Therefore C3, being C1 OR C2, is true (true OR true = true).

Conclusion: C3 is True.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 holds in the initial state s0.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" implies that in the next state s1 no events occur (in particular, event1 does not occur in s1).
- Therefore C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false at s0.
- If C1 fails at s0, then C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false, and hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state (so at time 0 we already have event1).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal: once it has occurred, no further events can occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3 (reading them in the natural way)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — taken here to mean “event2 occurs (at some point).”
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e. (event1) ∨ (event2 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some point in time C2 becomes true (in typical temporal logic this includes the current moment).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially, event1 is true now. Therefore C2 = (event1 ∨ C1) is already true right away (no need for event2).
- Since C2 is true at the initial moment, ""eventually C2"" is satisfied immediately. So C3 is true.
- C1, however, is false under the given rules: because event1 has already happened and is terminal, no further events (including event2) can occur after the initial state, so event2 does not occur.

Conclusion
- C3 is True (because C2 holds from the start thanks to event1).
- C1 is False; C2 is True; C3 True.

Note on interpretations: if you interpret ""eventually"" as requiring a strictly later time and disallow counting the current moment, then C3 would be false only if C2 were not true now and could never become true later. In our setting C2 is true immediately, so under the usual (inclusive) reading of ""eventually"" C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (the system starts in a state where event2 occurred).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — read as: in every possible run/execution, event2 occurs (i.e., event2 does happen in the system as given).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" — a disjunction: either C1 is false, or event2 happens (or both).

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because the initial state already has event2 happened, event2 does occur in the actual run(s). Given the rule that no events can happen after event2, there are no runs where event2 is absent. Thus C1 is true (event2 does occur in every run), so C2 is false.
- Regardless of C1/C2, the disjunction C3 = (C2 or event2) evaluates to (false or true) = true, because event2 does happen.

Short answer: C3 is False.

I'll show this step by step, using the usual temporal interpretation where ""always"" means ""at every future time (G)"" and ""in the next state"" is the X (next) operator.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happened (event1 is true at the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen — so once event1 has occurred the system moves (or stays) in a state where no events occur thereafter.
- Similarly, after event2 occurs, no other events can happen. (Here event2 never occurs in the given initial run because event1 already happened initially.)

A concrete timeline consistent with the rules:
- t = 0: event1 = true.
- t = 1,2,3,...: no events true (event1 = false, event2 = false, ...).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting as G(event1) — event1 is true at every time point.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreting as X(C1) = X(G(event1)) — at the next time point, event1 is true at every time point from there on.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Interpreting as G(X(G(event1))) — at every time point, the next state satisfies G(event1).

(If you meant a different formalization of ""always"" or of these conditions, say so; the conclusion below assumes the standard temporal interpretation.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and evaluation on the timeline?
- Evaluate C1 = G(event1) on the timeline: false, because event1 is true at t=0 but false at t=1 onward. So G(event1) does not hold.
- C2 = X(G(event1)): at t=0 this asks whether G(event1) holds at t=1. At t=1, event1 is false forever, so G(event1) is false at t=1. Therefore C2 is false at t=0.
- C3 = G(X(G(event1))): this requires X(G(event1)) to hold at every time. It already fails at t=0 (C2 false), so C3 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False (given the stated initial condition and transition rules, under the usual temporal logic meanings).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: G(event1) is false (event1 holds only at t=0), so X(G(event1)) is false at t=0, hence G(X(G(event1))) (C3) is false."

Summary answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules (constraints):
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So once either event occurs, nothing else can happen afterward. Given the initial condition that event2 already happened, there are no subsequent events.

3) What each condition means:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e. event2 ⇒ event1)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (i.e. C1 ⇒ event2)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (C2 is true; in all relevant moments/contexts)

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- From the given facts, event2 did happen (initially). The rules forbid any events after event2, so there is no later occurrence of event1. Unless you allow event1 and event2 to occur simultaneously at the initial moment, event1 did not occur. Thus under the usual reading (no simultaneous occurrence), C1 is false (event2 happened but event1 did not).
- C2 is the implication (C1 ⇒ event2). An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Also in fact event2 did happen, so the implication is true regardless. Therefore C2 holds.
- C3 says C2 always holds. With the world as given (event2 happened initially and nothing else can happen), C2 is true and remains true, so C3 is true.

Note on alternative interpretation: if simultaneous occurrence of events is allowed and both event1 and event2 happened initially, then C1 would be true, C2 would still be true (because event2 did happen), and so C3 would still be true. In either natural reading, C3 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start.
- Additional global fact: after event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. So whenever either event occurs it is terminal (no further events can occur).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has happened, no other event can happen afterwards.
- Because event2 happened initially, no further events (in particular event1) can happen in this run.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This claims that event1 occurs (in every relevant sense). In the actual run described (where event2 happened initially), event1 does not occur, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a material implication: C2 asserts (C1 → event1). That implication is true whenever C1 is false (vacuously true), and also would be true if C1 were true because “always happens” entails “happens.” So in the model C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" That is (C2 ∨ event1). It is true if either C2 is true or event1 happens.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- We already have: event1 does not happen, so the ""event1 happens"" disjunct is false.
- C2, the implication (C1 → event1), is true (vacuously true here because C1 is false).
- Therefore C3 = (C2 ∨ event1) is true (true ∨ false = true).

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so at the initial time, event1 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"": event1 implies that event2 will occur at some later point.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"": event2 is terminal (once event2 occurs, the process stops).

From these rules and the initial condition the actual sequence is: event1 happens initially, then event2 happens, then nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2: (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens). (C2 is the same formula as C1.)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Formally C3 is the implication C1 → C2.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 are syntactically identical propositions (call that proposition P). The implication P → P is a logical tautology: any statement implies itself. So C3 is true in all possible truth assignments.
- In the given context, both C1 and C2 are actually true (event1 already happened, and event2 must happen later), but that fact is unnecessary: even without those facts, P → P is always true.

Short answer: C3 is True (under the natural interpretation that ""happened"" is an instantaneous event and ""next state"" means the immediate successor).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event1 happened (so the first state contains event1).
- Constraints: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 no other events can happen.

2) Transition rules
- The system must go from event1 to event2 (event2 follows event1).
- Once event2 occurs the run ends (no further events).

So the only permitted sequence is: event1 (initial) → event2 → end.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just the same as ""event1 happens"" (a tautology collapsed to event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = ""event1 holds/occurs in the immediate successor state.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ""event1 does not hold in the next state.""

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At the initial state C1 is true because event1 happened.
- The next state is the state where event2 occurs (by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"").
- In that next state event1 does not occur (event2 occurs instead), so C2 is false.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Note on assumptions: If you instead interpret ""happened"" as a persistent past-tense predicate (""event1 has happened at some point in the past"") then C2 could be true and C3 false. The conclusion above uses the usual instantaneous-event / next-state reading.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Explanation: In the initial state event1 holds; by the rules the next state contains event2 (not event1), so C2 is false and thus C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur later.
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur later.
So starting from the initial event1, the rules force an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, … (i.e. event2 will occur at some later time, then event1 again, etc.).

Step 3 — meanings of C1, C2, C3
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” (There is some future time at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreting this temporally: at every point in time, C1 is true from that point onward — i.e. from every state there is a future event2 (equivalently, event2 occurs infinitely often).
- C3: “Event2 happens or C2 holds.” A logical disjunction: either event2 happens (at least once) or the stronger property C2 holds.

Step 4 — how they relate and final verdict
- From the initial event1 and the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” C1 is true (event2 will happen).
- Because the rules force alternation indefinitely, from every point in time there will again be a future event2, so C2 is also true (C1 holds always).
- Therefore C3, being (event2 happens) OR (C2 holds), is true. (In fact both disjuncts are true: event2 will happen, and C2 holds.)

Notes on possible ambiguity
- If “event2 happens” were read as “happens right now at the initial instant,” that left disjunct would be false, but C2 would still be true, so C3 would still be true.
- If “must happen” were not a guarantee but only a possibility, conclusions could change; with the ordinary reading “must happen” = guaranteed eventual occurrence, C3 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the start of the timeline event2 has already occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs at some time, then later event2 occurs.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal: once it has happened, nothing else can occur afterward.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (No occurrence of event1 at any time in the timeline.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (A conditional statement: C1 ⇒ (event1 happens).)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (C3 asserts that the implication C2 is false.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal (Rule B), no events can occur after that initial event2. Thus event1 cannot occur at any time. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event1."" Since C1 is true but event1 is false, the implication is false. Therefore C2 does not hold.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold; since C2 is indeed false, C3 is true.

Answer: C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Step 1: Initially event2 has happened, and Rule B says no events can happen after event2. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time. So C1 is true.

Step 2: C2 is the statement ""if C1 then event1."" With C1 true and event1 false, that implication is false. So C2 does not hold.

Step 3: C3 asserts that C2 does not hold. Since C2 is indeed false, C3 is true.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 has happened, event1 will occur).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 has happened, event2 will occur).
Together these enforce that once one event occurs the other must occur afterwards (they alternate or at least each forces the other to happen next).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — i.e. both C1 and C2 are true (equivalently: event1 does not happen).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what is the truth value of C3?
- Since event2 has happened initially and the rule says ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 must (indeed does) occur. Therefore C1 is false (event1 does happen). C2 is the same and so is false.
- C3 is the conjunction C1 ∧ C2, so false ∧ false = false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

(If you intended a different interpretation of ""must happen"" — e.g. a normative obligation that could be violated rather than a guaranteed occurrence — say so and I can analyze that alternative semantics.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (i.e., in the actual run under consideration, event2 occurs at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, it is followed by event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (a global claim that event2 occurs in every relevant execution/time.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., it is not the case that event2 always happens.)
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" (a disjunction: either event2 occurs (in the relevant sense) or C1 is false.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C3
- Logically, either C1 is true or C1 is false.
  - If C1 is true, then by C1 event2 happens, so the first disjunct of C3 is true → C3 true.
  - If C1 is false, then C2 is true, so the second disjunct of C3 is true → C3 true.
- Therefore C3 is true in all cases (it is a tautology given the definitions of C1 and C2).
- Concretely, from the context we also know event2 did happen initially, so the first disjunct is true in the actual run; that alone makes C3 true.

Short answer: C3 is true (given the usual reading that “Event2 happens” is true initially). Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: Event1 and Event2.
- Initial condition: Event2 happened in the initial state.
- Extra facts: After Event1 no other events can happen. After Event2 no other events can happen. (Both Event1 and Event2 are terminal: once either has just happened, no further events occur afterward.)

2) What are the transition rules?
- If a state is one “where Event1 just happened,” there is no outgoing event in the next state.
- If a state is one “where Event2 just happened,” there is no outgoing event in the next state.
- In particular, from the initial state (where Event2 happened) no subsequent event happens.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (A statement about the immediate next state.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (For every state, C1 is true — i.e., in every state the next state has Event1.)
- C3: “Event2 happens or C2 holds.” (A disjunction: either Event2 is true (in the relevant state) or C2 is true.)

4) How they relate and truth values (evaluated from the given initial situation):
- From the initial state Event2 has happened, and because “after Event2 no other events can happen,” Event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false in the initial state.
- Since C1 is already false in the initial state, C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.
- C3 is “Event2 happens or C2 holds.” In the initial state Event2 does happen (given), so the left disjunct is true. A disjunction with a true disjunct is true, so C3 is true.

Note on ambiguity: If you intended “Event2 happens” in C3 to mean “Event2 happens in the next state” (rather than “Event2 has just happened now”), then both disjuncts are false: Event2 does not happen in the next state (it already happened and no further events occur), and C2 is false — so C3 would then be false. Under the natural reading that uses the given “Initially, Event2 happened” as making the atomic “Event2 happens” true now, C3 is true.

- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then at some later time event1 will occur.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a conditional saying whenever event1 occurs, event2 also occurs (it does not specify temporal order unless one is added).
- C2: Same as C1 (the statement is repeated).
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" So C3 is true exactly when both C1 and C2 are true.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C3 true or false?
- From the context: event2 has already happened initially, and after that event1 must occur. So any occurrence of event1 in this system is accompanied by the fact that event2 has occurred (it already happened at the start). Therefore the conditional ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" is satisfied.
- C1 is true. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is true. Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) is true.

Note on interpretation: this conclusion assumes the conditional in C1/C2 only requires that event2 happens at some time (past or present), not that event2 must happen after event1. If instead C1 were intended to mean ""if event1 happens then event2 happens afterward,"" that would conflict with Rule A (no events after event1) and C1 would be false.

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 holds in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events (as intended by the description)
- Immediately after a state where event1 holds, event2 must occur (i.e. the next state after an event1 state is an event2 state).
- After a state where event2 holds, no further events ever occur (there are no later states in which event1 or event2 happen).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (true at a state s iff the successor state of s has event2)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists some future state t such that at t, C1 is true — i.e. at some future state the next state has event2)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (for every state s in every execution, C2 is true at s — i.e. from every state there is some later state whose successor contains event2)

4) How they relate and why C3 is false
- At the initial state: event1 holds, so by the rule event2 will be true in the next state. Thus C1 holds at the initial state, and therefore C2 holds there as well.
- Consider the state where event2 holds. By the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" in the successor of that state there is no event2. Moreover, there is no future state from which a successor with event2 exists (event2 does not occur again). So at the event2 state:
  - C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state),
  - C2 is false (there is no future state where C1 holds).
- Since C2 fails at the event2 state, C2 is not true at every state, so ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Answering step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0), event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. Interpreting “after” as the next state: if event1 occurs in some state, then event2 occurs in the immediately following state.
- After event2, event1 must happen (again, in the immediately following state).
- Thus the states alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … .

(If “after” were intended to mean “eventually after” rather than “in the immediate next state,” the pattern would be that event2 must occur at some future state after any event1, and event1 must occur at some future state after any event2. The conclusion below assumes the immediate-next-state reading, which is the usual reading for “after” in simple transition descriptions.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” With respect to the initial state s0, C1 asserts that event1 occurs in s1.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” So C2 is true exactly when C1 is false.
- C3: “C2 holds or event1 happens.” This is the disjunction (C2) ∨ (event1 in the next state). So C3 is true if either C2 is true or event1 occurs in the next state (or both).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? What are their truth values?
- From the transition rules and the initial state: s0 has event1, so by the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” s1 must have event2. Therefore event1 does not happen in s1.
- So C1 (event1 in the next state) is false.
- Hence C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is true.
- C3 is the disjunction “C2 holds or event1 happens in the next state.” Since C2 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 occurs in the next state.

Conclusion: Under the immediate-next-state interpretation, C1 = false, C2 = true, and C3 = true.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreting this as: any state where event1 has occurred has no outgoing event occurrences (no further events happen after that point).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Likewise, any state where event2 has occurred is also a sink with no further events.
Given the initial state s0 already has event1, s0 (or the immediate successor(s) after s0) is a sink with no further events.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (The next-state operator: in the immediate successor state, event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (Globally: in every reachable state, C1 is true.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (There exists some future state at which C2 is true from that point onward.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At the initial state s0, event1 already happened and by the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" there are no event occurrences in the immediate successor. Therefore C1 (event1 happens in the next state) is false at s0.
- Since C1 is false at s0, C2 (""always C1"") is false at s0 (an ""always"" property fails as soon as it is violated in any state).
- C3 (""eventually C2"") asks whether there is some future state where from that point C2 holds. Because the system is stuck after event1 (no future events can make C1 hold everywhere from some point on), there is no such future state. Thus C3 is false.

Note on edge cases: If one interpreted ""no other events can happen"" to allow repeated occurrences of event1 (i.e., event1 could happen again), the answers could change. Under the natural reading that ""no other events"" means no further event occurrences at all, C1, C2, and therefore C3 are false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state already has event1 and is a sink (no further events), so ""event1 in the next state"" (C1) is false now and never becomes true; therefore ""always C1"" (C2) never holds at any future point, and thus ""eventually C2"" (C3) is false."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Because event1 has already happened initially and rule B forbids any further events, event2 cannot occur at any later time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (a disjunction).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (formally: event1 → (event2 ∨ event1)).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (there is some time at or after now when C2 is true).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1 is true now (and forever) because event1 has already happened, so the disjunction event2 ∨ event1 is true.
- C2 is true now because whenever event1 holds, the implication event1 → (event2 ∨ event1) is true (the right-hand side contains event1 itself). So C2 holds immediately.
- C3 (""eventually C2"") is therefore true: C2 holds now (and will continue to hold because no further events can change anything).

Thus C3 is True. (If one used a stricter reading of “eventually” that excludes the present instant, the conclusion is unchanged because C2 holds at all future times as well — event1's terminality prevents changes.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 has already happened, so C1 (event2 ∨ event1) is true now, hence C2 (event1 → C1) is true now, and therefore C3 (""eventually C2"") holds."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (given): event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Logical form: event1 → event2.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal; this does not prevent event1 or event2 themselves from having occurred earlier.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Formally: event1 ∧ event2.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → (event1 ∧ event2).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Formally: event1 → (event2 → (event1 ∧ event2)).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final evaluation)?
- From the context we have event1 (true) and event1 → event2, so event2 is also true. Therefore C1 (event1 ∧ event2) is true.
- C2 asks: if event2 then C1. Since event1 is unconditionally true in the context, whenever event2 holds, event1 also holds; hence event2 → (event1 ∧ event2) is true. (Also in propositional logic the right conjunct is tautologically implied when event1 is true.)
- C3 asks: if event1 then C2. Because event1 is true in the context and we just showed C2 holds, the implication event1 → C2 is true.

Therefore C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — a state with event2 has no successor state in which any event occurs.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — likewise a state with event1 is terminal.
(Equivalently: any state that records event1 or event2 has no successor state with events.)

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just event2 ∧ event2, i.e. equivalent to event2 holding in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — formally X C1 (C1 true at the immediate successor state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — formally X C2, i.e. C2 true at the successor state of the current state. Unfolded, C3 is X X C1: C1 must hold two steps in the future.

4) How they relate and truth values
- At s0: C1 is True because event2 holds at s0.
- Is there a next state s1 where C1 holds? No — by the rule, after event2 no events happen, so there is no successor state with event2 (in fact no successor with any event). Therefore C2 is False at s0 (there is no next state in which C1 holds).
- Since C2 is not true in the next state (indeed there is no next state), C3 (which requires C2 to hold one step ahead) is also False.

(If one instead modeled time with silent successor states that contain no events, the same conclusion holds: the successor state does not satisfy event2, so C1 is false there; therefore C2 and C3 are false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C3 is X X C1. C1 holds in the initial state (event2), but there is no successor state with event2, so C2 (X C1) is false, hence C3 is false."

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition, C1 is true (event2 has already happened).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication: if event2 happens (C1), then event1 will happen. The transition rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" makes this implication true. Concretely, because C1 is true and the rule forces event1, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This says that at some time in the run the statement C2 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since event2 already happened, C1 is true now.
- The rule forces event1 to occur after event2, so C2 is true (in fact it holds immediately).
- Because C2 already holds (or will hold before any further events), C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true — it holds now (and thus eventually).

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- The events are event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, event1 cannot happen in this scenario.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the implication P → P. In standard logic P → P is always true (a tautology). Even if event1 does not actually happen, the implication is vacuously true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This claims the previous statement (C1) is false. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This claims C2 is false. Since C2 is indeed false, C3 is true.

4) How they relate (truth values)
- C1 = True (tautology P → P).
- C2 = False (negation of a true statement).
- C3 = True (negation of a false statement).

So C3 is True. (This conclusion does not depend on whether event1 actually occurs — C1 is true as a logical tautology.)

True.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — both events occur (at some times).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 is true in every relevant state/time (i.e., both events occur in every possible/future situation).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur after that. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- Under the natural reading that initially only event2 has happened, C1 is false (both events do not occur).
- If C1 is false, then ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
- Therefore C3, which says ""C2 does not hold,"" is true.

Note on ambiguity: if one allowed event1 and event2 to have occurred simultaneously at the initial moment, C1 could be true; but the usual reading of ""Initially, event2 happened"" together with ""after event2 no other events can happen"" implies event1 did not happen (so the conclusion above applies).

Short answer: C3 is False (under the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (i.e. at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — once event1 has occurred, no further events occur afterwards (the system is blocked/terminal with respect to events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" — if event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.

Immediate consequence: because event1 already happened initially and that forbids any further events, event2 can never occur at any later time.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e. in the immediately following state event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. in every state, C1 is true — equivalently: at every time, event1 occurs in the next state.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (i.e. there exists some time from which onwards C2 is true; eventually we reach a point after which C1 holds in every state.)

4) How they relate and truth values
- Given the transition rule, after the initial occurrence of event1 no events occur thereafter. So in the next state after the initial one there are no events — in particular, event1 does not (re)occur in that next state. Therefore C1 is false at the initial state.
- Since C1 is already false now, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Because nothing can change (no events can ever happen after the initial event1), C2 will never become true later. Thus C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is also false.

(If you meant a different reading of ""no other events"" — e.g. “no other events besides event1” so event1 could repeatedly occur — the answers could change. Under the natural reading above, C3 is False.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.
- Additional global constraint: after event2 occurs, no other events can occur any later.

Step 2 — transition rules (constraints)
- After event2: the run stops (no further events possible).
- After event1: event2 must occur afterward. (So any occurrence of event1 would require a later event2.)

Combining these with the initial condition: because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 nothing can happen, no occurrence of event1 is possible in the future (and there is no earlier time when event1 could have happened, given the stated initial condition). So the only actual event that happens in the run is event2.

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — logically: event2 ∨ event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — C1 ∨ event1, which simplifies to event2 ∨ event1 (same as C1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — means C2 is true at every point of the run (i.e., globally).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- Since event2 does happen (initially), C1 is true.
- Because C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 is also true.
- The run contains only the initial situation (event2 happened) and no future events/states where the disjunction could fail, so C2 is true in every reachable state of the run. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Note on semantics: if you interpret “eventX happens” as an instantaneous proposition true only at one instant and you insist on checking C2 at instants after that where no event proposition holds, you must be explicit about what time points exist after the initial one. Under the natural reading given (initial event2 and then no further events/states), C3 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C2 simplifies to (event2 ∨ event1), which is true because event2 has already happened. Under the given semantics (no further states after the initial event2), C2 holds at every reachable point, so ""C2 always holds"" is true. (If one instead interpreted time as continuing with instants where no event-propositions hold, the result would depend on that semantic choice.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (given).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. So if event1 occurs, the system stays in a state where no further events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the initial condition.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., ¬(event1))
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the negation of C1, so C2 ≡ ¬C1 ≡ event1 (C2 says event1 happens).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That is, at some time (now or in the future) C2 is true — equivalently, event1 holds at some time.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event1 happened initially, C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is true — in fact true immediately and permanently, because once event1 has happened no further events occur to change that fact.
- Since C2 holds immediately (and continues to hold), C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.

So C3 is True. (If you use a temporal operator ""eventually"" that excludes the present instant, the conclusion still holds because C2 holds at all subsequent times as well.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (i.e., at the initial time point event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (whenever event1 happens, event2 follows).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; nothing can happen after it).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a claim that at least one of event2 or event1 occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — a conditional: whenever C1 is true, event1 must be true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the claim that the conditional C2 is false.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition, event2 happens. Therefore C1 is true (because event2 happens, making ""event2 or event1"" true).
- C2 says: if C1 is true then event1 happens. Since C1 is true, C2 requires event1 to happen.
- But given the context, event2 already happened initially and rule B says nothing can happen after event2. That prevents event1 from occurring after the initial event2. There is no information allowing event1 to have happened before the initial state, so under the standard reading event1 does not occur at any time in this scenario.
- Thus C2 is false (it demands event1, which does not occur). Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Note on ambiguity: If you allowed event1 to have occurred simultaneously with the initial event2 (or before it), then C2 could be satisfied. Under the natural reading implied by ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the consistent conclusion is that C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is False under the usual interpretation that ""eventX happens"" is an instantaneous occurrence. (If instead ""event1 happened"" is treated as a persistent past fact, then C3 would be True — I note both interpretations below.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the initial moment (so event1 has occurred at time 0). event2 has not occurred initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 occurs no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).
- Because event1 already occurred initially, no other events (including event2) can occur after that initial moment.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (a tautological repetition).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" That is (event1) ∧ (event1), which is again equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that C2 is true at every time point (i.e., at all times in the timeline).

4) How do these conditions relate and is C3 true?
- C1 and C2 both reduce to the single atomic claim ""event1 happens."" That claim is true at the initial moment (by the initial condition).
- Whether C3 is true depends on how you read ""happens"":
  - Standard instantaneous reading: ""event1 happens"" is true only at the moment the event occurs. It is true at time 0 but not at later time points (there are later moments with no event happening). Thus C2 is not true at all times, so C3 (""always C2"") is False.
  - Persistent/past-fact reading: if ""event1 happened"" is a persistent factual statement (once true, remains true forever), then C2 is forever true and C3 would be True.

Conclusion: under the usual interpretation used in event/temporal reasoning (events are instantaneous), C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C2 reduces to ""event1 happens"", which (under the usual instantaneous reading) holds only at the initial moment. C3 (""always C2"") requires it at every time point, which fails. (If ""event1 happened"" were treated as a persistent past fact, C3 would be True, but under the standard interpretation it's False.)"

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happens.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at the next step we have event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (all later steps have no events).

A simple timeline (discrete steps) consistent with the context:
- time 0: event1 true
- time 1: event2 true
- time 2, 3, ...: no events true

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Read as a state formula: at a given time, C1 is true iff event1 or event2 holds at that time.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Means: at every time point in the run, C1 is true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Means: whenever event2 occurs (at some time), from that point onward C1 is true at every time.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Evaluate C1 on the timeline: true at time 0 (event1), true at time 1 (event2), but false at time 2 and later (no events).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because there are times (time 2 onward) where neither event holds.
- C3 is the implication: ""if event2 happens (it does at time 1), then C2 holds."" Since event2 does happen but C2 is false, the implication is false.

Thus C3 is False.

(If you intended different semantics for ""happens"" or ""always"" — e.g., treating ""event1 happened"" as a permanent past fact rather than a momentary proposition — state the intended temporal semantics and I can re-evaluate. Under the usual instantaneous-event interpretation above, C3 is false.)

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 already happened (true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 ⇒ event2; given event1 is true, event2 will occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal; nothing occurs after it.)

3) What C1, C2, C3 mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (logical implication: event2 ⇒ event1)
- C2: the same as C1 (identical statement).
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — i.e. (C1 ∨ C2).

4) How they relate and final truth value
- From (1) and (2): event1 happened initially, and therefore (by the rule) event2 will happen later. Thus both event1 and event2 do in fact happen in the scenario.
- Given event2 happens and event1 has already happened, the implication event2 ⇒ event1 is true (both antecedent and consequent are true). So C1 is true; C2 is identical so also true.
- Therefore C3 = (C1 ∨ C2) is true (indeed both disjuncts are true).

(If you intended a different temporal meaning of the implications — e.g., ""if event2 happens then event1 happens afterward"" — the answer could differ; with the usual reading here, C3 is True.)

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (this is the starting fact about the system).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen.
Thus once either event occurs, the system has no further events. Given the initial condition, event1 has already happened, so no further events (including event2) can occur in this run.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the implication event2 → event2. In propositional logic that is a tautology (P → P) and is always true in any state or run.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" This is the disjunction (C1) ∨ (event2). Since C1 is true (a tautology), the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that C2 is true at every point (every state/time) in the run(s) being considered.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and is C3 true or false?
- C1 is always true (tautology).
- Therefore C2 is true right now (true ∨ anything = true).
- There are no transitions that can make C1 false (it is a logical tautology) and, given the system rules and the initial condition (event1 already happened and no further events can occur), there are no future states that could falsify C2.
- Hence C2 holds at every state of the run, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

True

I'll go through the four parts you asked for, then state whether C3 is True or False and why. I will also point out the one modelling assumption that matters.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e. once event1 has occurred the system has no further event occurrences).
- After event2, no other events can happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs it also leaves no further events).
Combined with the initial condition (event1 already happened), this implies event2 never occurs in the future of the initial state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a (state) implication: event2 ⇒ event1. If event2 never occurs, the implication is vacuously true wherever it is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Written temporally: F(C1). That means there is some (current or future) state where C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Written temporally: X(C2). That means in the immediate successor state, C2 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final truth value of C3)?
- C1 is true in the initial state (vacuously, because event2 does not occur anywhere).
- Therefore C2 (eventually C1) is true already in the initial state — it holds immediately (you don't need to wait).
- Now the truth of C3 depends on whether there is a defined “next state.” Two interpretations:

  A. Standard model-checking / LTL view with a terminal state having no successor:
  - Because after event1 no further events can happen the initial state is terminal (no successor). The next-state operator X(…) is false when there is no successor state. So X(C2) is false. Conclusion: C3 is False.

  B. Alternative model where time can advance (or the state stutters) even though no new events occur (i.e. there is a successor state that looks the same but exists):
  - If there is a defined successor state (an idle/stuttering successor) then C2 will also hold in that successor (since C1 still holds there), so X(C2) would be True.

Which answer is appropriate depends on your semantic assumption about “next” at a terminal state. Under the usual interpretation used in model checking (no successor → X φ is false), C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: with the given facts the initial state is terminal (after event1 no successor). Under the usual next-state semantics (X φ is false at a state with no successor), X(C2) is false. (Only if you assume an implicit/stuttering successor would C3 become true.)"

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, the system has no further event occurrences).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, then event2 must occur later).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction — it is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ ""event1 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" ≡ in the immediate successor state the statement 'event1 does not happen' is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition (event2 has happened) and the rule “after event2 no other events can happen,” event1 cannot occur now or in any future state. Therefore in the initial state C1 is false and C2 is true (event1 does not happen).
- Whether C3 is true depends on how you treat the phrase “the next state”:
  - If your model has a next state (e.g., you allow a successor state where nothing happens), that successor also cannot have event1 (because no events can occur after event2). Then C2 is true in that next state, so C3 is True.
  - If your semantics treat the state after event2 as terminal and the ""next"" operator is false when there is no successor (standard semantics in some temporal-logic frameworks where Xφ is false at a terminal state), then there is no next state and C3 is False.

Summary answer: C3 is True under natural “there is a next (idle) state” interpretation; C3 is False under semantics that require an actual successor state for the next-operator to be evaluated.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 has already happened and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" means event1 does not occur now or in any future state. So C1 (event1 happens) is false, C2 (event1 does not happen) is true now, and in the immediate successor state event1 also does not happen. Hence C3 is true (assuming a successor state exists)."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After an occurrence of event1, event2 must occur.
- After an occurrence of event2, event1 must occur.
These rules force the events to alternate: starting from the initial event1, the allowed sequence is event1, event2, event1, event2, … (either immediately or eventually at each step depending on how “must” is interpreted, but in either case event2 will occur after event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.”
- C2: “Event2 eventually happens.” (same as C1)
- C3: “C1 holds and C2 holds” (the conjunction of the two).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial event1 and the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 will occur after the initial event1. So C1 is true.
- C2 is the same statement as C1, so C2 is also true.
- Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) is true.

Caveat: this conclusion assumes “must happen” is a guarantee (not merely a possibility or a probabilistic statement). If “must” were not a guarantee, truth could differ.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That means if event2 ever occurs, a later occurrence of event1 must follow it.

Given event1 already happened initially, no events can occur after that, so event2 can never occur in the run.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (A temporal claim that at some point event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (Negation of C1.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (Negation of C2; equivalently, double negation of C1.)

4) How they relate and final truth values
- Because event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2, being ""not C1"", is false.
- C3, being ""not C2"", is therefore true. (Formally C3 = not(not C1) = C1.)

Therefore C3 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (i.e., at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: once it has happened, no further events occur.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (same wording as C2)
- C2: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally C3 is C1 → C2.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and whether C3 is true
- Note first that C1 and C2 are the same proposition (they assert the same thing).
- In propositional logic any formula of the form P → P is a tautology (always true). So C1 → C2 is true regardless of whether C1 actually holds in the scenario.
- (Separately: the given scenario does not necessarily entail C1 — the scenario only says event1 happened initially and is terminal; whether “event1 always happens” is a stronger claim — but that does not affect the validity of C1 → C2.)

Conclusion
- C3 is True (it is a tautology because the antecedent and consequent are identical).

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, nothing else can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Logically this is p → p (with p = “event2 happens”), which is a tautology — true for every truth-value of p. In other words, C1 holds unconditionally (always).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, the disjunction is always true regardless of whether event1 occurs.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that C2 is true at all times.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Because C1 is a tautology, C2 is true at all times (it’s a disjunction with a always-true disjunct).
- Therefore C3, which asserts that C2 always holds, is true.

So C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is the tautology p → p (with p = ""event2 happens""), so C1 always holds. Hence C2 (""event1 happens or C1"") is always true, and therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e. at the start, event2 is true).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 occurs afterward).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (event2 → event2); it is always true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true unconditionally, C2 is true as well (the implication holds regardless of whether event2 actually happens).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This is the conjunction of C2 and the fact that event2 happened.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From (3), C1 is true. Hence C2 is true. From (1), event2 did happen. Therefore the conjunction C2 ∧ event2 is true.

So C3 is True.

(If you intended a non-classical reading where these ""C"" statements are events rather than logical assertions, note that the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" would only block other events, not the truth of logical statements — under the usual reading above, C3 is still true.)

2) Transition rules

- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

From these rules and the initial condition, event2 already having happened prevents any later events (including event1) from occurring. So in the timeline that starts with the given initial state, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2 (and there is no earlier time to place event1 in the usual reading of “initially”).

3) What the conditions mean

- C2: “event1 happens and event2 happens” (the same formula as C1).
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds” (C1 → C2).

4) How they relate and final verdict
- C1 and C2 are identical propositions.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (it has occurred at the start).
- Additional facts: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. Because event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur afterward.

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either happens, the run stops (no further events are possible).
- Given the initial event1, the actual run is: event1 then stop. Event2 never occurs in this run.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is the proposition ¬E, where E = ""event1 happens"".
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally C2 is (¬E) → E.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asks whether C2 is true at every point/for the given model.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation
- From the context E is true (event1 did happen initially). Therefore C1 (¬E) is false.
- The implication C2 = (¬E) → E is true in the actual run: an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). So C2 holds.
- Because event1 occurs in the model and there is never a time at which ¬E becomes true, C2 holds at every point of the model/trace. Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True under the natural interpretation relative to the given scenario.

Important note (different interpretation): if ""always"" were meant across all possible alternative models (not just the given one), then C3 would be false — there exist models where event1 never happens (¬E true), and in such a model (¬E) → E would be false. But given the provided context (event1 happens initially), C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event2 has happened (we are in the state immediately after event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., in the next state event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the state after event1 is terminal). The second rule is not needed to decide the hypothesis, but it confirms there is an event1 occurrence and then nothing else.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (a proposition saying event1 does not occur in the relevant state)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Equivalently: in the next state, event1 does not happen.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Equivalently: it is not the case that in the next state event1 does not happen (i.e., the next state does have event1).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the rules, in the next state event1 must happen. Therefore in the next state the proposition “event1 does not happen” (C1) is false.
- Hence C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is false.
- Therefore C3, which asserts “C2 does not hold,” is true.

So C3 is True (given the stated rules).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen next. (Write this as: event2 → event1.)
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen next. (event1 → event2.)
- Together these give an alternating sequence starting from the initial event2: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally, this is p → p (where p means “event1 happens”).
  - In standard propositional logic p → p is a tautology (always true): whether p is true or false, p → p evaluates to true.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is also a tautology (always true).
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" This is C1 ∨ C2.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Since C1 is true (a tautology), C1 ∨ C2 is true regardless of C2. (C2 is also true, but only one disjunct needs to be true.)
- Therefore C3 is True.

Note: This conclusion does not depend on the initial condition or the transition rules — C1 and C2 are logical tautologies independent of the event dynamics.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 will eventually occur afterwards).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: Event1 eventually happens (from the current point / from the start).
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. Formally: event2 -> eventually event1.
- C3: C2 always holds. Formally: globally (event2 -> eventually event1), i.e. at every point in every execution the implication in C2 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final verdict
- From the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” we already have the property event2 -> eventually event1. That is exactly C2.
- C1 is true in the given initial execution because event2 occurred initially and the rule forces event1 to happen thereafter.
- C2 is true in the system because the rule enforces it.
- C3 (that C2 always holds) is also true: the rule is a global constraint, so at every point the implication event2 -> eventually event1 holds. (Also note that after event1 no further events can occur, so any hypothetical antecedent “event2 happens” after event1 is false and the implication is vacuously true there.)

- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially (at the start of the timeline).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would be terminal).
Given event1 happened initially, no further events can occur after that.

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" i.e. ""event1 eventually happens OR event1 eventually happens"" (equivalently just “event1 eventually happens”).

Note about “eventually”: usually this means “at some time from now onward” and often includes the current moment. If your notion excludes the current moment (i.e. strictly future), the conclusion can differ — I address that below.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Since event1 has already happened initially, the statement “event1 eventually happens” is true under the usual (non-strict) interpretation that “eventually” includes the present moment. Therefore C1 is true, C2 is true, and hence C3 (C1 or C2) is true.
- If, however, you use a strict-future reading of “eventually” that excludes the current moment, then event1 does not occur later (no events can occur after event1), so C1 and C2 would be false and C3 would be false.

Short conclusion: Under the standard (inclusive) reading of “eventually,” C3 is True. Under a strict-future reading, C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Since event1 has already occurred initially, the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" is true (under the usual non‑strict reading that includes the present), so C1 is true and therefore C3 (C1 or C2) is true."

Short answer: C3 is True (assuming the usual temporal/read-as-future meaning of “eventually” and that events do not repeat).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state s0, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. So from s0 there is a next state s1 where event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So s1 is terminal (no state after s1 contains any event).

(So a simple linear trace: s0: event1, then s1: event2, then nothing further.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Interpreting “eventually” in the usual future sense (F operator in temporal logic): at the current state there exists some current-or-later state where event1 holds. At s0 this is true because event1 already holds at s0.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: in the next state s1, it should be true that “event1 eventually happens” (i.e., there is some state at s1 or later where event1 holds).
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” That asserts that C2 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate?
- Evaluate C1 at s0: true (event1 already occurred at s0).
- Evaluate C2 at s0 (i.e., check C1 at s1): at s1, is there any current-or-future state where event1 holds? No — event1 happened in the past (s0) and, given the rules, it does not reoccur in s1 or later. So C1 is false at s1; therefore C2 is false.
- C3 says C2 does not hold, which matches the above: C3 is true.

Caveat: If you instead interpret “eventually” to mean “at some time (past or future)” rather than the usual future-only meaning, then event1 would count as “eventually happens” at s1 (because it happened at s0), making C2 true and C3 false. The answer above uses the standard future-oriented interpretation.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Interpreting ""eventually"" as future-only, C1 holds at s0 but C2 (C1 at s1) is false because event1 does not occur at s1 or later, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 occurs, the run is terminal; no further events can occur after it.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There is some future point where event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (Both event1 occurs and event2 eventually occurs.)
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" (Either event1 occurs, or both event1 and event2 occur.)

4) How the conditions relate and truth-values
- From the initial condition and Rule A: because event1 has already happened and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen at any later time. So C1 is false.
- C2 requires both event1 and C1. event1 is true, C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 is logically E1 ∨ (E1 ∧ C1), which simplifies to E1. Since event1 is true initially, C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” (¬E2).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” = ¬(¬E2) = E2 (so C2 says event2 does happen).
- C3: “C2 does not hold” = ¬(E2) = ¬E2 (so C3 is the same statement as C1).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the rules, event2 must happen, so E2 is true.
- Therefore C1 (¬E2) is false.
- C2 (E2) is true.
- C3 (¬E2) is false (and indeed logically equivalent to C1).

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
Given event1 happened initially and it prevents any further events, event2 does not and cannot occur in this run.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event1 → event1. This is a tautology (always true): any proposition implies itself.
- C2: same as C1 (event1 → event1). Also a tautology, therefore true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally: (event1 → event1) → (event1 → event1).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since C1 is true (a tautology) and C2 is the same tautology and thus true, the implication C3 (True → True) is true.
- More generally, because C1 and C2 are identical tautologies, C3 is necessarily true in every model.

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after the initial event1).
- After event2, no further events can happen (the sequence stops once event2 has occurred).

So the intended allowed sequence is: event1 occurs (initially) → event2 occurs → nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just a redundant expression of ""event1 happens."" So C1 means event1 happens (it is true at the initial moment).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says that event1 holds at all times (i.e., event1 is true always, not just initially). The context gives only that event1 happened initially, not that it holds at all times, so C2 is false in the given scenario.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is a material implication: C2 → (event2 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C3 true or false?
- In classical logic, an implication is true whenever its antecedent is false. Since C2 is false (event1 does not hold always), the implication C2 → event2 is vacuously true. 
- Independently, from the scenario we also know event2 does happen after the initial event1, so the consequent (event2 happens) is actually true as well. Either way, the implication C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (so the system starts in a state where event1 has occurred).

(Assume the usual sequential-time reading: “after X” means strictly later than X, and events are not simultaneous.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, the run is terminal: no future occurrence of event2 (or anything else) is possible.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur).

Given Rule A and the initial condition (event1 already occurred initially), there is no time after the start when event2 can occur (because no events can occur after event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (logical implication: event2 → event1)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as the temporal statement that at every time point the implication of C1 is true (often written G(event2 → event1)).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Another layer of ""always"", i.e., G(G(event2 → event1)). (In linear temporal logic G(G φ) is equivalent to G φ, so it is redundant.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what is the truth value of C3?
- Because of Rule A and the initial event1, event2 never occurs in any reachable future. Thus the antecedent of the implication in C1 never holds, so C1 is vacuously true.
- If C1 holds at every time, then C2 is true.
- G(G φ) is equivalent to G φ, so if C2 is true then saying ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is also true.
- Therefore C3 is True.

(Notes: if you allow a different interpretation — e.g., events can be simultaneous, or “after event1 no other events” is only intended from some later point, or there are histories where event2 occurred before the initial event1 — the conclusion might change. Under the natural reading above, C3 is True.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 has already occurred and Rule A forbids any further events, so event2 never occurs; C1 is vacuously true at every time, hence C2 and therefore C3 are true."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, the system produces no further events.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.)

Given Rule A and the fact that event1 already happened initially, no further events can occur at any later time.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some future time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some future time it becomes true that event2 will eventually happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — C2 is false.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because event1 already happened and Rule A forbids any events after that, event2 can never occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false now and will remain false at all future times, C2 (""eventually C1"") is also false.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.
- Additional constraints given as rules below.

2) Transition rules (constraints)
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur after that time).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. if event1 happens then event2 must also happen at some later time).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (event1 ∧ event2).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. event1 → (event1 ∧ event2). This is equivalent to event1 → event2 (because event1 → (event1 ∧ event2) simply requires that whenever event1 is true then event2 is true).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" i.e. C2 ∧ event2.

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition, event2 has happened, so ""event2 happens"" is true.
- C2 is exactly the same as Rule B (or at least implied by it), so C2 is true (also note it would be vacuously true if event1 cannot occur).
- Therefore C3 = (C2) ∧ (event2) = True ∧ True = True.
- C1 is not guaranteed true: for C1 to be true event1 must also have happened. But because event2 already happened and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot happen after the initial event2 (unless event1 happened before event2, which the problem does not state). So under the usual reading C1 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

Short answer: Under the natural reading that “after event2 no other events can happen” means no events at all can occur after event2, C3 is False.

Now the step-by-step reasoning you asked for:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 happens, no other events can happen afterwards.
- Rule B: After event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards.
(Each rule means that the occurrence of that event makes all subsequent states event-free.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (i.e. immediately after the initial state).
- C2: same as C1 (so C1 and C2 are identical statements).
- C3: “C1 holds or C2 holds” — logically C3 = C1 ∨ C2, so because C1 and C2 are the same, C3 is true iff that single proposition is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event2 already happened in the initial state and Rule B says no events can occur after event2, the next state (immediately after the initial state) cannot have any events. Therefore C1 is false. C2 is the same, so false. C3 = C1 ∨ C2 = false ∨ false = false.

Note on ambiguity: If one instead reads “no other events can happen” to mean “no events other than the same event may happen” (i.e., event2 might be allowed to repeat but no different events may occur), then C1/C2 could be true and C3 true. But the common interpretation of “no other events can happen” is that no events at all happen thereafter; under that reading C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (so the current/initial state has event1).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → once event1 occurs, there are no enabled transitions to any next event (event1 is terminal).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" → if event2 occurs, then the next event must be event1. (This rule is irrelevant unless event2 ever occurs.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e. in the state immediately following the initial one)
- C2: same as C1 (identical statement).
- C3: C1 ∧ C2 (both hold).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 is terminal (""after event1, no other events can happen""), there is no next state with any event; in particular, event1 does not occur in the next state. So C1 is False. C2 is the same, so False. Therefore C3 = C1 ∧ C2 is False.

(Aside: the rule about event2 forcing event1 is irrelevant since event2 does not occur after the initial event1.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Since event1 has already occurred and no events can happen after event1, there is no next-state occurrence of event1. Thus C1 and C2 are both false, so C3 (C1 ∧ C2) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (constraints)
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it occurs no further events occur).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreting this as the usual global reading used in these problems: event1 never occurs (at any future time).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" In temporal logic notation: F(C1) — there exists some future time at which C1 becomes true. Since C1 says ""event1 never occurs"", C2 says ""at some future point we are in a situation where (from that point onward) event1 never occurs.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That is F(F(C1)). In linear-time temporal logic F(F(p)) is equivalent to F(p), so C3 is logically equivalent to C2.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- Because event2 has already happened and the rule says ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 is guaranteed to occur at some future time. Therefore C1 (""event1 never occurs"") is false.
- If C1 is false forever (event1 will occur), there is no future time at which ""event1 never occurs"" becomes true. So C2 (F(C1)) is false.
- Since C3 is equivalent to C2 (F(F(C1)) = F(C1)), C3 is false as well.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the system starts in a state where event2 occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
Given event2 already happened initially, the system is in a terminal state and no further events (including event1) can occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is redundant but equivalent to simply “event1 happens.”
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is the statement “event1 does not happen.”
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That is, at all times (now and in the future) event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, event1 cannot happen now or ever later. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 (the negation of C1) is true.
- Since event1 can never occur in the future, C2 holds at all times, so C3 is true.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, eventually event2 will occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, eventually event1 will occur).
So the system forces an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is exactly the second transition rule (event2 implies a subsequent event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says the implication in C1 is a global/invariant rule of the system (true at all times).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the statement that from the fact that C1 is always true one can conclude event2 actually occurs.

4) How they relate and the truth values
- C1 is true (it matches the given rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"").
- C2 is true as a description of the system (C1 is an invariant rule).
- C3: two ways to read it:
  - As a pure logical implication from C2 alone: C2 by itself (the fact that ""if event2 then event1"" always holds) does not force event2 to occur. So C2 → event2 is not entailed by C2 alone.
  - As evaluated in the full given context (including the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen""): event2 will in fact occur (since event1 already happened and that forces event2). Because the antecedent C2 is true and the consequent (event2 happens) is true in the scenario, the material implication C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is true in this scenario.

Short answer: C3 is true in the given context (but note that C2 alone does not logically imply event2 — the occurrence of event2 depends on the initial event1 and the transition rules).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state (call it s0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (so any state where event1 occurs must have a successor state where event2 occurs).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen — a state with event2 is terminal (no successor states).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P). It is true in any state, whether or not event1 actually happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is a next-time statement (X C1): C1 must be true in the immediate successor state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This is a global/always statement (G C2): in every state, C2 must hold.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C3 true or false?
- In s0 (the initial state) event2 has happened and s0 is terminal (no successor).
- C1 is true in s0 (and would be true in any state).
- C2 = X C1 requires a successor state where C1 holds. Because s0 has no successor, the truth of C2 depends on which ""next"" semantics you use:
  - Under the standard (strong) LTL next operator X, X φ is false at a terminal state. So C2 is false in s0, hence C3 = G C2 is false.
  - Under a weak-next semantics (where ""next φ"" is interpreted as true at a last state), C2 would be true in s0, and then C3 would be true (trivially, since s0 is the only state).
- Typical temporal-logic conventions use the strong next (X). Therefore, under the usual interpretation, C3 is false.

Short answer: Ambiguous in general (depends on next-operator semantics), but under the standard strong-next LTL semantics, C3 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has happened, no further events can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — if event2 happens, it also prevents any later events.
Given event1 already happened initially, that blocks any subsequent events (so event2 cannot occur later).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2: (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens). (C2 is identical to C1.)
- C3: C1 OR C2.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the initial condition, event1 is true. Therefore C1 is true (since event1 happens makes the disjunction true). C2 is also true for the same reason.
- C3 = C1 OR C2, and since at least one (in fact both) of C1 and C2 is true, C3 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Additional facts: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once one of them happens, the run stops (no further events).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- If event2 occurs, the system has no outgoing transitions (no further events ever).
- If event1 occurs, likewise no further events ever.
- Since the initial state already has event2 happened, the system is already in a terminal state and no event1 can occur at any time in this run.

Step 3 — meanings of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (read as a global claim that event1 holds/occurs at all relevant times — in particular it requires event1 to hold sometime or at every state depending on intended formalization; here the natural reading is that event1 occurs in the run.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, the statement C1 is true.)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" (a conditional: if in the next state C1 is true, then event1 happens — interpreted here as event1 happens in the current run.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth values
- Evaluate C1: False. Because the initial (and only possible) event that happened is event2, and after event2 no further events can happen, event1 does not happen in this run. So the claim ""event1 always happens"" is not satisfied.
- Evaluate C2: False. In the next state (the state after the initial event2), there are no events and certainly C1 (""event1 always happens"") does not hold there.
- Evaluate C3: True (vacuously). C3 is a material implication ""if C2 then event1 happens."" Since C2 is false in the given situation, the implication is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

Note: if you intended different temporal semantics (for example, interpreting ""then event1 happens"" as ""event1 happens in the next state"" or using a non-classical logic), the verdict could differ. Under the standard reading above (classical material implication and the given terminal-event rules), C3 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C2 is false (the next state does not satisfy ""event1 always happens""), so the implication ""if C2 then event1 happens"" is vacuously true under classical material implication."

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From 1 and 2 we can conclude event1 does in fact occur (because event2 occurred and forces event1).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally, this is the implication (event1 → event1).
- C2: same as C1.
Both C1 and C2 are tautologies (an instance of p → p), so they are true in standard propositional logic regardless of whether event1 actually occurs. Given our model event1 does occur, so the implications are also true in that specific run.

4) How the conditions relate
- C3 is the conjunction C1 ∧ C2. Since C1 is true and C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C1 and C2 are redundant (identical statements), so C3 is simply the true statement repeated.

Short answer: C3 is False (under the standard ""strong next"" semantics used in LTL/temporal reasoning). Explanation step by step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (state is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (also terminal).
- So from the initial state (where event2 has happened) there is no successor state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"" and is true in the initial state (because event2 happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the temporal Next operator requires the immediate successor state to exist and satisfy C1.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — the Always (G) operator requires C2 to hold in every state along the trace (in particular, in the initial state).

4) How do they relate and final evaluation?
- C1 is true in the initial state.
- But there is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so with the standard (strong) Next semantics Xϕ is false when there is no successor — hence C2 is false in the initial state.
- Since C2 is false in the initial state, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Note: If you instead use a weak-next operator that is defined true when no successor exists, then C2 (and hence C3) would be true. Under the usual temporal-logic convention (strong next), C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, the system has no further event transitions).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 is required to occur afterwards).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (No occurrence of event1 anywhere in the trace / from now on.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (Globally: at every state, event1 does not happen.)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" (In the immediate successor state, it is true that C2 holds.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C3 true or false?
- Because event2 has already happened in the initial state and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any point in the execution. Therefore C1 is true.
- If event1 never occurs, then ""C1 always holds"" is true: C2 is true.
- If C2 is true at all states, it is certainly true in the next state as well. Therefore C3 is true.

One caveat: if your temporal semantics treat ""next"" as requiring an actual successor state and the trace is considered to have no successor after the terminal state (so ""next φ"" is undefined or false), then C3 could be considered undefined/false under that strict semantics. Under the usual interpretation that the system still has successor states (or that global truths hold at all states including any successor), C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 already occurred and no further events can happen, so event1 never occurs (C1 true). Therefore ""always C1"" (C2) holds, and hence it also holds in the next state (C3). (Caveat: under a semantics where ""next"" is false/undefined at a terminal state with no successor, C3 would be false; under the usual infinite-trace or stuttering/self-loop semantics used here, C3 is true.)"

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (it has already occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant formulation and simplifies to ""event2 happens"" (i.e., the proposition that event2 occurs at some moment).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted in the usual temporal/global sense, this asserts that ""event2 happens"" is true at all times (i.e., globally true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts that it is not the case that C1 always holds.

4) How they relate and final truth value
- We know event2 does happen initially, so C1 is true at that initial moment.
- But C2 claims C1 is true at all times. Under standard reading, that is false: after event1 (which must happen next) no further events occur, so event2 does not hold at all times (it only held at the initial moment).
- Therefore C2 is false, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Answer: C3 is True (given the usual interpretation of ""always"" as globally/at all times).

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

(Assumption: “after event1, event2 must happen” is read as event2 must occur in the next state after the state where event1 happened. If you meant “event2 must happen at some later time but not necessarily the immediate next state,” see the caveat at the end.)

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → event2 must happen (so the state immediately following the event1 state contains event2).
- After event2 → no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Under the transition rule, this is true.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” This is the conjunction of C1 (true) and event1 (true in the initial state) → C2 is true.
- C3: “Event1 happens or C2 holds.” This is a disjunction. Since event1 already happens, the disjunction is true (and in fact C2 also holds).

4) How they relate
- C2 implies C1 (and requires event1).
- C3 is satisfied already by event1 alone; it is therefore true regardless of the truth of C2, and remains true here because both event1 and C2 are true.

Conclusion: C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = True.

Caveat: If “must happen” was intended to mean “must happen at some unspecified future time” (not necessarily the immediate next state), then C1 (“happens in the next state”) would not be guaranteed by the premise and the truth values could change.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).
- Further constraints: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So any valid run is event1 then event2 and then nothing else.

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- From event1 you must go to event2 (event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- From event2 there are no outgoing events (execution ends).
- There is no rule saying event1 happens at all times or repeatedly — only that it happened initially.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting “always” as “for all times / in every state,” this is not supported by the context. We only know event1 happened initially; we do not know (and in fact cannot have) event1 happening after event2, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is the conjunction (C1 ∧ event1). Since C1 is false, the conjunction is false even though event1 did happen initially. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the implication (C2 → event1). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 is false.
- C2 is false (because C1 is false).
- C3 is true, because C2 is false, so the implication C2 → event1 is vacuously true.

Therefore, C3 is True (under standard propositional/implicational semantics).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1 is terminal: once it has occurred, no further events occur.)

Note: Since event1 has already happened initially, Rule B prevents any later events (so event2 cannot occur after that). Rule A is therefore not violated because its antecedent (event2 occurring) never happens.

Step 3 — meanings of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (A or A = A).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" In propositional form: (event1) → (event1), i.e. A → A.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C3
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition. The implication A → A is a tautology in classical logic (always true).
- Given the context, C1 and C2 are in fact true (event1 did happen initially), so the implication is true as well (true → true = true).
- Even abstractly, C3 is true regardless (A → A is always true).

Conclusion: C3 is True.

True

Reason: C1 and C2 both reduce to ""event1 happens,"" so C3 is A → A, which is a tautology (and in the given context A is true), so the implication holds."

Short answer: C3 is False (under the standard reading that events are instantaneous and there is at least one next state where no events occur). Below are the step‑by‑step answers.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state 0) event2 happens (so event2 is true in state 0, event1 is false there).

2) Transition rules between events?
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — once event1 occurs at some state, all later states have no events.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” — similarly, once event2 occurs, all later states have no events.
- Thus both event1 and event2 are terminal: if one occurs in a state, subsequent states contain no events.

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: (event1) OR (event2) — true in a state exactly when one of the events happens in that state.
- C2: always C1 — C1 holds in every state (globally).
- C3: next C2 — C2 holds in the next state (i.e., from the next state onward, C1 holds in all states).

4) How do these conditions relate; truth values?
- State 0 (initial): event2 is true, so C1 is true in state 0.
- State 1 (the next state): by the “after event2 no other events can happen” rule, no events occur here, so event1 = false and event2 = false → C1 is false in state 1.
- Therefore C2 (C1 everywhere) is false: C1 is not true in all states (it fails in state 1).
- C3 asks whether C2 holds in the next state. In state 1, C2 is false (C1 is false in state 1 and hence not true everywhere from state 1 onward). So C3 is false in the initial state.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

(If you adopt a nonstandard interpretation — for example, treating “no other events can happen” as meaning there is no successor state at all — the truth of “next” may be undefined or treated differently by a specific logic. The above answer uses the common model where there is a next state with no events.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 has happened (event1 is true in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means that any state where event1 holds has no successor state (no outgoing transitions).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" can be read as: whenever event2 happens, event1 must hold afterward (i.e., event2 implies that event1 holds in the next state). The crucial fact is that because event1 holds initially and blocks further transitions, there are no successors from the initial state, so event2 cannot occur anywhere reachable from the initial state.

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — symbolically event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology; it is true in every state (whether or not event2 actually holds).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. globally (in every state) C1 is true. Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X(C2): there exists a next state and in that next state C2 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 is true in the initial state (tautology).
- C2 is true (C1 holds in all states).
- C3 requires a successor state where C2 holds. But by the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" the initial state (where event1 holds) has no successor. Under the standard semantics of the ""next"" operator, X(phi) is false when there is no next state. Therefore C3 is false.

(If you use a nonstandard semantics that treats ""next"" at a terminal state differently, the answer could differ, but under the usual temporal-logic semantics X requires a successor, so C3 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Explanation: The initial state has event1 and therefore no successor; under standard semantics X(C2) is false when there is no next state, so C3 is false."

- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we are in the state ""after event2"").

2) Transition rules
- After event1 no other events can happen — any state reached by event1 is terminal.
- After event2 no other events can happen — any state reached by event2 is terminal.
- Therefore the initial state (after event2) is a terminal state with no successor.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a tautological restatement of ""event2 happens"" — so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C1). Because the current state is terminal there is no next state; under the usual (standard) semantics for the next operator, X φ is false at a last/terminal state. So C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e. G C2). Since C2 is already false in the initial state, C3 is false.

4) How they relate / conclusion
- C1 is true now.
- C2 is false because there is no next state to satisfy C1.
- Therefore C3 is false.

(If you adopt a different formal semantics where ""next"" is treated differently, the conclusion may vary, but under standard temporal-logic semantics used here, C3 is False.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at least once).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen.
These rules force an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … so both events will occur (at least sometime) given the initial event1.

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (i.e. both events occur)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (the same statement as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (C1 → C2)

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition (identical meaning). Any proposition implies itself, so C1 → C2 is logically true (a tautology).
- Also, under the given initial condition and transition rules, both C1 and C2 are true (both events occur), so the antecedent and consequent are true in the scenario as well.

Reasoning: initially event2 occurs, and after event2 no further events can occur, so the run ends right away.

C2 (C1 or event2) is true at the initial moment (because event2 happened) but will be false at subsequent moments (C1 is false and event2 does not occur again).

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event1 has happened (at the start).
- Global constraint: after event1, no other events can happen.

2) Transition rules
- Rule: if event2 happens, then event1 must happen (i.e., event2 ⇒ event1 somewhere thereafter).
- Combined with the global constraint: because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is also no earlier time before the initial moment, so effectively event2 does not happen at all.

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3 (and their truth values)
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (event2 ∨ event1). Since event1 did happen initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (event2 ⇒ C1). This implication is true in the actual situation: the antecedent (event2) is false, so the implication is vacuously true. Also logically, even if event2 were true, C1 would still be true (because event2 ⇒ (event2 ∨ event1) is a tautology).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" (event1 ∧ C2). We have event1 true and C2 true, so C3 is true.

4) How they relate
- C1 is already satisfied by the initial event1.
- C2 is an implication that holds either vacuously (in the actual timeline, since event2 doesn't occur) or tautologically (if event2 occurred it would make C1 true).
- C3 just combines the true facts (event1) with the true implication (C2), so C3 is true.

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
- Since event2 happened initially, the system stops there; event1 does not occur later.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a state formula true if at least one of those events occurs at that time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — F(C1): there exists a time now or in the future when C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — F(C2): there exists a time now or in the future when C2 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- At the initial time, event2 has happened, so C1 is true immediately.
- If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is true now (take the present time).
- If C2 is true now, then ""eventually C2"" (C3) is true now.
Therefore C3 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at least once).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, a later event1 will occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so when event1 occurs, a later event2 will occur).
- These rules imply alternating occurrences of event2 and event1 (given at least one occurrence).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., both events occur).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" which expands to ""Event2 happens and (Event2 happens and Event1 happens)"". Concretely C2 is the conjunction of event2 and event1 (with event2 appearing twice).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" (C2 ⇒ event2).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C3
- By construction C2 includes event2 as a conjunct. So whenever C2 is true, event2 is necessarily true as part of that conjunction.
- Therefore the implication C2 ⇒ event2 is logically valid (a tautology). It is true regardless of the temporal transition rules or whether C2 ever actually occurs.
- (As a side note: even if C2 were impossible, the implication would still be true vacuously; if C2 occurs, event2 must occur because it is part of C2.)

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur.
So the system forces alternation: ... → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: “event1 happens or event2 happens” (i.e. event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: “event1 happens or event2 happens” (the same formula as C1).
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds” (C1 → C2).

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 and C2 are syntactically identical propositions. Therefore for every possible state/valuation C1 has the same truth value as C2.
- An implication X → X is always true (a proposition implies itself). Thus C1 → C2 is a tautology.

Conclusion
- C3 is True. (Given the stated definitions of C1 and C2, C3 holds trivially.)

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happened (event1 is true at the initial state).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpret as: whenever event1 holds at a state, event2 must hold at the next state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 holds, event1 must hold at the next state.
These two rules force the system to alternate: starting with event1 at time 0, we get event2 at time 1, event1 at time 2, event2 at time 3, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally C1 = (event2 → event2). This is a propositional tautology; it is true in every state (it carries no information).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally C2 = X C1 (X = next). Since C1 is true in every state, C1 in the next state is true in every state; therefore C2 is true at every state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Formally C3 = F C2 (F = eventually). Because C2 already holds (indeed at every state), C2 holds at some (in fact every) future state. So C3 is true.

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- C1 is universally true (tautology).
- C2 is true everywhere because it just asserts that the tautology holds in the next state.
- C3 asks that C2 holds at some future point; since C2 holds immediately (and always), C3 is true.

Note: This conclusion depends only on the syntactic form of C1 as event2 → event2. If C1 were intended to be something different (for example event2 → event1), the answer could change; with the intended alternating rules and C1 as written, C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.
- Rule B: After event1 has occurred, no other events can occur (event1 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (a temporal claim: at some time ≥ now, event2 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (the negation of C1; i.e. event2 does not eventually happen)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (at some time ≥ now, the statement C2 is true)

4) How they relate (reasoning)
- Since event1 has already happened initially and rule B forbids any events after event1, no future event (including event2) can ever occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is true (it is already true now that event2 will never happen).
- C3 asserts that C2 will be true at some time ≥ now. Because C2 is already true at the initial time, C3 is true (in standard temporal semantics ""eventually"" allows the current time).

Therefore: C1 = false, C2 = true, and C3 = true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 already occurred and forbids any future events, so event2 cannot eventually happen (C1 false), hence C2 is already true now, and therefore ""eventually C2"" (C3) holds."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (identical to C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (i.e., C1 ⇒ C2)

Step 4 — how they relate
- From the transition rule (after event2, event1 must happen) and the fact event2 happened initially, event1 will indeed eventually happen. Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred (i.e., the system starts in a state after event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards (event1 → event2).
- Rule B: If event2 occurs, no other events can occur after it (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there exists a future time at which event1 happens).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (the same proposition as C1).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" (C1 ⇒ C2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event2 has already occurred initially and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur at all. Therefore event1 cannot happen at any future time. So C1 is false, and C2 (the same statement) is also false.
- The implication C3 (C1 ⇒ C2) is true in two ways:
  a) Logically, any proposition implies itself (P ⇒ P is a tautology).
  b) In the model, the antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true (false ⇒ false is true).

Conclusion: C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is True (under the usual meaning of ""next"" in temporal logic).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state S0, event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, the next state must have event2 (whenever event1 occurs, its successor state contains event2).
- After event2 occurs, no further events can happen — i.e., a state with event2 has no successor (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — read as ""in every state along the trace, event1 holds"" (globally).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X C1: in the immediate successor state, C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. ¬(X C1).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- We start in S0, which has event2. By the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" S0 has no successor state.
- In standard temporal-logical semantics, X φ (the ""next"" operator) is false if there is no successor state. So C2 (X C1) is false in S0.
- Therefore C3, which is ¬C2, is true.

Note/caveat: this conclusion depends on the usual interpretation that ""next"" requires an actual successor and is false when none exists. If your semantics treat ""next"" differently (for example, allow implicit stuttering steps or treat next as vacuously true without a successor), the result could differ. Under standard semantics, C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: S0 contains event2 and is terminal (no successor). Under standard temporal-logic semantics Xφ is false when there is no next state, so X C1 is false in S0; hence C3 = ¬(X C1) is true. (If your ""next"" were defined differently, the result could change.)"

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the system starts with event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 will occur next).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; nothing follows it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally: event2 → event2.
- C2: same as C1: event2 → event2.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally: (event2 → event2) → (event2 → event2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The formula event2 → event2 is a logical tautology (any proposition implies itself). It is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.
- C3 is the implication ""if C1 then C2"". Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication is true. More generally, because C1 and C2 are identical tautologies, C3 is itself a tautology.

Conclusion: C3 is True. The truth of C3 follows purely from the logical form of the conditions; the specific event-transition rules in the context do not affect this particular conclusion.

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual reading that ""eventX happens"" is an occurrence at a time point, not a permanent fact). Below are the steps you asked for.

1) What events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial time, event1 happened (so ""event1"" is true at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 occurs, there are no subsequent event occurrences.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

Note: because event1 already occurs initially and it blocks any further events, event2 cannot occur at any later time in this trace.

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is P → P, a logical tautology; it is true whenever implications are read classically.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This is true exactly at times where event1 happens (and C1 is already true always).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that at every time point along the run/trace, C2 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 is trivially true.
- C2 is true at the initial time because event1 happened there (and C1 holds).
- C3 demands C2 be true at all times. Under the usual semantics for events as occurrences at particular times, event1 is true only at the initial moment and is false at later moments (even though no further events occur). Thus C2 is not true at later times, so C3 is false.
- The rule about event2 is irrelevant to making C3 true, because event2 never occurs (it is blocked by the initial event1) and so it does not force additional occurrences of event1.

Caveat: If you instead read ""event1 happened"" as a persistent state/property that remains true forever once it has happened, then C2 would hold at all times and C3 would be true. But with the common interpretation that events are instantaneous occurrences, C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 occurs only at the initial time (not at all later times), so C2 is not true at every time point and therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That says event2 would also be terminal if it ever occurred, but it does not force event2 to occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — i.e., (Event2 does not happen) OR (Event2 does not happen), which is equivalent to just (Event2 does not happen).

4) How the conditions relate
- Because event1 happens initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur after that initial point. Therefore C1 is true. C2 is identical, so C2 is also true.
- Since at least one disjunct of C3 holds (in fact both hold), C3 is true.

Note on assumptions: This uses the natural reading that ""initially event1 happened"" fixes the start point and ""after event1"" prohibits any later occurrence of event2. If you instead allow event2 to have occurred before the initial moment or simultaneously with event1, conclusions would differ — but under the usual temporal interpretation, C3 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Once event1 has happened, the system is terminal — no event, including event2, can occur later.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same disjunction twice, so C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 = ""event2 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That is, at all times, event2 does not happen.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because event1 happened initially and Rule B forbids any events after event1, event2 cannot occur at any future time. Therefore ""event2 happens"" is false, so C1 is false and C2 (event2 does not happen) is true.
- Moreover, since event2 can never happen (given the initial event1 and Rule B), C2 holds at all times. Therefore C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True — assuming the usual propositional reading that ""Event1 happens and Event1 happens"" is just a redundant conjunction asserting Event1 holds. (If you instead intend C1 to mean “Event1 happens twice at distinct times,” there is an ambiguity and the result flips; I explain both below.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterward.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens and event1 happens.” Two readings:
  - Propositional reading: this is simply event1 ∧ event1, which is logically equivalent to event1 (redundant).
  - Temporal/multiplicity reading: it asserts two distinct occurrences of event1 (event1 occurs, and then later occurs again).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — the negation of C1.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — the negation of C2 (i.e., ¬(¬C1) which is C1 in classical logic).

4) How the conditions relate and final truth-value:
- From the initial condition we know event1 occurs.
- Under the propositional reading of C1 (event1 ∧ event1 ≡ event1):
  - C1 is true (because event1 happened).
  - C2 = “C1 does not hold” is false.
  - C3 = “C2 does not hold” is true.
  - Conclusion: C3 is True.
- Under the temporal reading (C1 requires two distinct occurrences of event1):
  - Because event1 is terminal (no events can happen after event1), a second occurrence of event1 cannot occur after the first. So C1 is false.
  - Then C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.
  - C3 (C2 does not hold) is false.
  - Conclusion in this interpretation: C3 is False.

Which interpretation is intended determines the answer. If you mean the simple logical conjunction, C3 is True; if you mean “event1 happens twice at different times,” C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
These rules make the two events alternate (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...). In particular, event1 does occur (because initial event2 forces event1), and event2 occurs (initially and repeatedly).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (This claims event2 never happens.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” (A conditional: C1 ⇒ event1.)
- C3: “C2 holds and event2 happens.” (Both the conditional C2 is true and event2 occurs.)

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- C1 is false because event2 did happen (initially).
- C2 is true: in classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Also, independently, event1 actually does occur because of the transition rules, so the consequent is satisfied anyway.
- Event2 happens (true) — explicitly given initially (and also by the alternation).

Therefore C3 (C2 holds AND event2 happens) is true. 

(Note: this uses standard material implication. If you intended a different notion of ""if"" — e.g., a causal or counterfactual conditional that requires the antecedent to be possible or instantiated — the evaluation of C2 could be interpreted differently. Under ordinary logical reading, C3 is True.)

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened (so event1 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 occurs it is terminal: no further events (including event2) can happen afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 were to happen, then event1 must occur afterward (event2 implies a subsequent event1).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 OR C2.

4) How they relate and final truth values
- Given the initial condition, event1 happens, so the disjunct (event1 happens) is true.
- Therefore C1 is true, and C2 (identical) is true.
- C3 = C1 OR C2 is the disjunction of two true propositions, so C3 is true. (More simply, since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is equivalent to C1 and thus true.)

Note: If one tried to make event2 happen after the initial event1, that would violate the rule that no events can occur after event1, so event2 cannot occur in this scenario.

Short answer: C3 is True under the natural reading. Explanation step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur after that (typically interpreted as “event2 implies event1 next/soon”).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 occurs the run has no further events (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted syntactically as (event1 → event1) at the same time point. This is a tautology: whenever you evaluate it at a state, it is true (p → p is always true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" = F(C1). Since C1 is true immediately (and in fact at every state), there exists a time where C1 holds — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = G(C2). Because C2 holds at the initial time (and C1 is true at every time), C2 holds at every time, so C3 is true.

4) How they relate
- C1 is globally true (a tautology), so C2 (eventually C1) holds, and therefore C3 (always C2) also holds. So C3 = True.

Note on ambiguity: if you intended C1 to mean a temporal property like “event1 → next(event1)” (i.e. if event1 happens now then event1 happens in the next step), that is a different formula and need not be true here (because event1 is terminal, so there may be no next event). Under that ""next"" interpretation C1 can be false at the time event1 occurs, and then C2/C3 could fail. Under the plain propositional reading (event1 → event1) used above, C3 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction of the same proposition is just that proposition).
- C2: same simplification — ""Event2 happens"".
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" therefore simplifies to ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. p → p).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C3
- C1 and C2 are identical propositions; the implication C3 is p → p, which is a logical tautology and therefore always true.
- Concretely, since the initial condition says event2 did happen, both C1 and C2 are true, so the implication is true as well.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred initially (at the start of the execution).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
Given that event1 already happened initially, the first rule prevents any further events from occurring after that point.

3) What the conditions mean (reading them naturally)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e. event2 never occurs in the execution.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some time in the execution from which point C1 is true (equivalently: at some time we are in a situation where event2 does not occur).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — at every time point in the execution it is true that eventually C1 holds.

(If you prefer a slightly different formal reading of “eventually/always,” the same reasoning applies once you fix that C1 means “event2 never occurs.”)

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- Since event1 happened initially and after event1 no events can happen, event2 can never occur. Therefore C1 is true (event2 does not happen).
- If C1 is true from the start, then ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is trivially true (it already holds now).
- Because C1 is true at every time (no future actions can change it), C2 is true at every time, so C3 (""always C2"") is true.

Thus C3 is True.

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (call that state0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after a state where event2 occurred has event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after a state where event1 occurred has event2).
- Therefore the system alternates: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (interpreted relative to the initial state — i.e., in state1).
- C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (the same claim as C1).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (i.e., C1 → C2).

4) How they relate / truth values
- From the sequence, in the next state (state1) event1 happens, not event2. So C1 is false (and likewise C2 is false).
- Logically, C3 is the implication P → P (since C1 and C2 are the same proposition). An implication P → P is always true (a tautology). More generally, if the antecedent is false the implication is vacuously true; if the antecedent were true, the consequent is the same and would also be true.
- Therefore C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is False (assuming the usual semantics where ""in the next state"" requires a successor state; in a terminal state Xφ is false).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state s0, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means any state where event1 holds has no successors (no outgoing transitions).
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That means if a state has event2, then any immediate successor must have event1.

Given the initial state s0 has event1, Rule A makes s0 a terminal state (no next state). Rule B is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in s0 (and cannot occur later because there is no later).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" As a propositional implication this is a tautology: event2 → event2 is always true in any state (it is true whether or not event2 holds).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is true in every state (true ∨ anything = true).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This is the temporal ""next"" of C2 (often written X C2). To evaluate C3 at s0 we need a successor state of s0 and then check C2 there.

4) How do these conditions relate and what's the truth value of C3?
- At s0: C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- But s0 has no successor (by Rule A). Under the standard semantics where Xφ is false if there is no next state, C3 = X C2 is false at s0.
- (If your formalism instead treats terminal states as having an implicit self-loop, then there is a next state equal to s0 and C3 would be true. But with the plain reading ""no other events can happen"" → no successor, C3 is false.)

Conclusion: Under the natural reading that ""after event1 no other events can happen"" makes the initial state terminal, C3 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (formalized)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: event2 ⇒ event1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: event1 ⇒ event2.
- Together these give mutual implication: event1 ⇔ event2. With event1 initially true, event2 must also be true (and vice versa).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens = (event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: same as C1 = (event2 ∨ event1).
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds = (C1 ∨ C2) = (event2 ∨ event1) ∨ (event2 ∨ event1) which simplifies to (event2 ∨ event1).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C3

- Therefore C1 is true, C2 is true, and so C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual reading that ""happens"" is an instantaneous occurrence and does not persist to later states). Below is the step‑by‑step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: Initially event2 happened (so in the initial/current state event2 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Means: if event1 happens at some state, there are no later states in which any other event occurs.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Means the same for event2: once event2 has happened, no later events occur.
- In particular, because event2 already happened initially, there will be no subsequent state in which a new event occurs (event1 will not occur later).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 ≡ (event1 happens). C1 is true in a state iff event1 occurs in that state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — true in a state iff event2 occurs in that state or event1 occurs in that state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — we're asking whether, in the state immediately after the current one, C2 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C3 true?
- In the initial/current state: event2 happens, so C2 is true now.
- Consider the next state:
  - Because event2 happened in the initial state and we are told ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the next state (if there is one) will not have event2 occurring, nor will it have event1 occurring.
  - Therefore in the next state: event2 is false and C1 (event1) is false, so C2 is false in the next state.
- Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Note on alternative semantics: if you instead adopt a persistence interpretation where ""event2 happens"" remains true in all future states after it occurs, then C2 would remain true and C3 would be true. But under the standard instantaneous-event interpretation (and the given “no other events can happen” making event2 terminal), C3 is False.

Short answer: C1 = True, C2 = True, and C3 = True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it happened initially).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This exactly restates the rule “after event1, event2 must happen.”
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This asserts event1 did happen (given) and that the rule C1 is true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This says any time event2 occurs, it must be the case that event1 happened and C1 holds.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1 is true because it is given by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen.""
- C2 is true because event1 did happen initially and C1 holds, so the conjunction holds.
- C3 is true because C2 is true independently of whether event2 has happened yet. More concretely: the context forces event2 to occur only after event1, and C1 is a global rule, so whenever event2 occurs the earlier event1 has already happened and C1 holds — hence the implication (event2 → C2) is satisfied. (Also logically, an implication P → Q is true if Q is true in the world; here Q = C2 is true.)

Note: This assumes ""event1 happens"" in C2 is interpreted as ""event1 has happened at some time (in the history of the system)"" rather than e.g. ""is happening right now."" Under that natural temporal interpretation, C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it is true initially). There is no indication that event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Given event2 happened initially, no further events can occur; in particular event1 does not and cannot occur after that.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally: event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology (always true in classical logic).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Formally: C1 ∨ event2. Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true; also event2 is true in the given initial condition, so C2 is true either way.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally: C2 → event2.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C3?
- We already have C2 true (because C1 is a tautology and/or because event2 is true).
- C3 is an implication with consequent event2. Since event2 is true in the actual situation, any implication whose consequent is true is true. Concretely: C2 is true and event2 is true, so C2 → event2 is true.
- Therefore C3 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (so at least once, event1 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs (E2 ⇒ E1).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs (E1 ⇒ E2).
- From E1 ⇒ E2 and the fact that event1 happened initially, we can conclude event2 does occur (at least sometime after that initial event1).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬E2).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — as a material conditional: (¬E2) ⇒ E1.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" — i.e. ((¬E2 ⇒ E1) ∨ E2).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From step 2 we have event2 does happen, so C1 (¬E2) is false.
- C2, viewed as a material implication, is true whenever its antecedent is false; so with C1 false, C2 is true (vacuous truth). (Also independently E1 did happen, so the implication is not contradicted.)
- C3 is ""C2 or event2"". Since event2 is true and C2 is also true, the disjunction is true.

Conclusion
- C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: initial event1 and E1 ⇒ E2 give event2, so C1 (¬E2) is false; C2 (¬E2 ⇒ E1) is therefore true (vacuously) and E2 is true, hence C3 = C2 ∨ E2 is true."

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual reading that states continue to exist after events even if no new events occur). Below are the steps.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. Interpreting this as: in the state immediately after s0 (call it s1) event2 occurs.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means in all states after the state where event2 occurs (s2, s3, ...), no events occur (they are event-free).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a tautological restatement: C1 is true exactly in states where event2 happens (we can treat it as simply “event2 happens”).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that in every state (the current and all future states) C1 is true — i.e., event2 happens in every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Evaluated at s0, C3 says: at s1, C2 should be true (i.e., starting from s1, C1 must hold in every state).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Timeline under the rules: s0: event1. s1: event2. s2, s3, ...: no events.
- Evaluate C2 at s1: C2 would require event2 to hold in every state s1, s2, s3, ... But at s2 (and later) no events occur, so event2 does not hold there. Therefore C2 is false at s1.
- Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false at s0.

(One caveat: if you adopt an unusual semantics where the occurrence of event2 causes the execution to stop so there are no states after s1 at all, then ""always"" quantified over the empty future can be vacuously true and C2 could be true at s1 — in that degenerate model C3 would be true. Under the standard linear-time model with further states that are just event-free, C3 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: at s0 the next state s1 has event2, but later states s2,... do not, so ""always event2"" (C2) is false at s1; thus C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state 0) event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (This says that once event1 has occurred, no further events occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e. in the state immediately following the initial state)
- C2: identical to C1 (same claim).
- C3: C1 or C2 — therefore C3 is true exactly when event1 happens in the next state.

Step 4 — relate them and evaluate C3
- From Rule A and the initial condition: event1 has already occurred in the initial state, and Rule A forbids any further events after that. So no events happen in the next state. In particular, event1 does not happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, and their disjunction C3 is false.

Note on ambiguity: if one instead interprets ""no other events can happen"" to mean ""no events other than event1 can happen"" (i.e. event1 could repeat), then the situation is ambiguous: the rules do not force event1 to occur in the next state, so C1/C2 would be not guaranteed (unknown). Under the natural reading that no events occur after event1, C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 will occur.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has happened, the execution is terminal: there are no further events/states after that point.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some future state (from the initial state) in which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state of the current state, C1 is true (i.e., from that next state event2 eventually happens).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2.

4) How they relate and final deduction
- Because the initial state s0 already has event1 and Rule B says no other events can happen after event1, there are no successor states and event2 cannot occur in the future of s0. Therefore C1 is false.
- Since there is no next state (s0 is terminal), ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false (C2 is false).
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is true.

Thus C3 is True (given the usual semantics that a ""next"" property is false at a terminal state).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: s0 is terminal (event1 already happened and no further events can occur), so C2 (""in the next state, C1 holds"") is false (there is no next state). Therefore C3 = ¬C2 is true."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event1 happened.
- Additional rules: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" These say that once either event happens the system goes into a terminal (no-further-events) situation.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs at some time t, then for all times t' > t no events occur.
- Likewise, if event2 occurs at some time t, then for all t' > t no events occur.
- Because event1 already occurred at time 0, the system is already in the terminal situation from time 0 onward (so no event2 or any further event can occur at times ≥1).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Formally (in LTL-style) C1 = X(event1) — at the current time, event1 holds at the immediately following time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Formally C2 = F(C1) — there exists some future time at which X(event1) is true (equivalently, there exists some time t such that event1 holds at t+1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Formally C3 = F(C2) — there exists some time at which C2 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 already occurred at time 0 and no events can occur after that, there is no time t ≥ 0 with event1 at t+1. Hence C1 is false at time 0 (and in fact false at every time).
- If C1 is false at every time, then C2 = F(C1) is false (there is no time where C1 is true).
- If C2 is false at every time, then C3 = F(C2) is false.

Therefore C3 is false.

(If you adopt a nonstandard semantics — e.g. an infinite-state model where events persist or where ""next"" wraps around — the answer could differ. Under the usual discrete linear-time semantics and the statement ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" the conclusion above holds.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is given that initially event2 happened).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. event2 → event1 at a later time).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Given the initial condition that event2 happened, C1 is false.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” This is a material implication (C1 → event1). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true (vacuously). Separately, by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 indeed does happen in the actual scenario.
- C3: “Event2 happens and C2 holds.” This is the conjunction (event2) ∧ (C2).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value of C3
- event2 happens: true (given).
- C2 holds: true (vacuously true because C1 is false; also event1 actually occurs because event2 happened).
- Therefore C3 = true ∧ true = True.

Short answer: C3 is True (assuming standard temporal semantics where “next” is evaluated on existing successor states or on infinite traces). The transition rules about event1/event2 do not affect this, because C1 is a propositional tautology. Below is the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means from any state where event2 has just happened all later states contain no events (or at least neither event1 nor event2).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That means if event1 occurs in some state, then event2 occurs in the next state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: (event1 → event1). This is the proposition p → p with p = “event1 happens”. p → p is a propositional tautology: it is true in every state (true when p true, and true when p false).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — formally X C1.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — formally X C2, which is equivalent to XX C1 (C1 holds two steps ahead).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since C1 is true in every state, it is true in the next state and in every further state. Therefore X C1 (C2) is true in any state that has a defined successor, and XX C1 (C3) is true in any state that has a successor and a successor-of-a-successor.
- The concrete transition facts about event1/event2 do not make C1 false anywhere, because C1 does not depend on the particular truth value of event1 (it is p → p).

Caveat about finite traces / dead-end states:
- If your semantics treats a state with no successor as making X φ (next φ) false or undefined, and the initial state has no successor (i.e., the run ends right after the initial event2), then X C1 and XX C1 would be false/undefined at the initial state. Under that finite-run convention, C3 would be false (because there is no state two steps ahead).
- Under the usual LTL semantics on infinite traces (or whenever there are the required next states), C1 being a tautology implies C2 and C3 are true.

So: under normal infinite-trace / existing-successor semantics, C3 is True. If your model has no next states after the initial state and your “next” operator is false on terminal states, then C3 would be false.

- Also we know event2 initially happened.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — formally event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology (always true) under standard material implication.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — formally event1 → (event2 → event2). Because C1 is always true, C2 is true (an implication whose consequent is a tautology is true).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" — formally event2 → (event1 → (event2 → event2)). Since C2 is already true (a tautology), C3 is true as well.

4) How they relate
- C1 is a tautology, so C2 (which merely asserts C1 under the condition event1) is true regardless of whether event1 occurs. Because C2 is true, C3 (which asserts C2 under the condition event2) is also true regardless of whether event2 occurs.
- The given transition facts (event2 initially happened; event2 is terminal; event1 → event2) do not change these truth-values under ordinary propositional/material implication.

Therefore C3 is True. (If you intended a different non-classical/temporal/obligational reading of the ""if...then"" statements, say so and I can re-evaluate under that formalism.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- The only events mentioned are event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from a state with event1 the next state must have event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from a state with event2 the next state must have event1).
Thus the system forces an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … . In particular, from the initial event1, event2 will occur next and thereafter they alternate forever.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just the conjunction of the same proposition; it is equivalent to saying “event2 happens” at that time (i.e., redundant repetition).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Equivalent to “eventually event2 holds” (there exists some time at or after now where event2 is true).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Formally: event2 → (eventually event2).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth of C3
- From the rules and the initial event1, event2 will occur (so C2 is true).
- More generally, if event2 holds at some time t, then:
  - Under the usual temporal semantics where “eventually” (F) allows the current time, event2 at t immediately makes F(event2) true (take the witness t). So event2 → F(event2) is trivially true.
  - Even if “eventually” is read as strictly in the future (excluding the current instant), the alternation guarantees that after event2 comes event1 and then event2 again, so there will be a later time with event2. So event2 → (future)event2 also holds in this system.
- Therefore C3 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True (at the initial state).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (time t0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — interpreted as: if event2 happens at time t, then event1 happens at time t+1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — likewise: if event1 happens at time t, then event2 happens at t+1.
- These rules force an alternating sequence: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1 (at time t): ""event1 does not happen at time t.""
- C2 (at time t): ""C1 holds in the next state"" = C1(t+1) = ""event1 does not happen at t+1.""
- C3 (at time t): ""C2 holds in the next state"" = C2(t+1) = C1(t+2) = ""event1 does not happen at t+2.""

4) How they relate (evaluate at the initial state t0)
- t0: event2 happened ⇒ event1 does not happen ⇒ C1(t0) = True.
- C2(t0) = C1(t1). But t1 has event1 (by the rule), so C1(t1) = False ⇒ C2(t0) = False.
- C3(t0) = C2(t1) = C1(t2). At t2 event2 happens (so event1 does not happen), hence C1(t2) = True ⇒ C3(t0) = True.

Therefore C3 is True (given the usual ""next-state"" interpretation of ""after"").

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: t0 = event2, so t1 = event1, t2 = event2. C3 evaluated at t0 is C1(t2) = ""event1 does not happen at t2"", which holds because t2 is event2."

Step 1 — what events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition / occurrence rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, event1 must also occur (interpreted as: event2 → event1 in that execution).

Given the initial event1 and the first rule, event2 cannot occur in this system (there is no time after the initial event1 when event2 could happen).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the proposition event2 → event2, which is a logical tautology (always true). More generally, an implication with the same antecedent and consequent is always true; and if event2 never happens, the implication is vacuously true.
- C2: same as C1 (same formula), so also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is the implication C1 → C2.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- C1 is true (tautology / vacuously true in this model).
- C2 is true for the same reason.
- Therefore C3 (C1 → C2) is true: a true antecedent implying a true consequent makes the implication true (and in fact C1 and C2 are identical tautologies, so C3 holds in all interpretations).

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (call it e1) and event2 (e2).
- Initial condition: e2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After e2, e1 must happen. (So from the initial e2 we can conclude e1 does occur.)
- Rule B: After e1, no other events can happen. (e1 is terminal — nothing follows it.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: e1 → e1. This is a self-implication. In standard logic (material implication, or any usual deductive system), A → A is always valid (a tautology / reflexivity of implication).
- C2: identical to C1 (also e1 → e1), so it is also a tautology.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally: (e1 → e1) → (e1 → e1).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 are the same statement; each is a tautology (always true). Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.
- C3 is an implication between two true statements (or between identical tautologies). An implication whose antecedent is true and consequent is true is true; also (A→A)→(A→A) is itself a tautology.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen after it (event1 is terminal).

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e. event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (the same formula).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" (C1 ⇒ C2).

4) How do they relate?
- C1 and C2 are syntactically the same proposition. In propositional logic P ⇒ P is always true (a tautology).
- Also, given the initial condition that event1 has happened, both C1 and C2 are true in the actual scenario (because event1 is true), so the implication C1 ⇒ C2 is certainly true in the scenario as well.

Conclusion: C3 is true (both because the implication is a logical tautology when antecedent and consequent are identical, and because the initial conditions make the antecedent true and thus the implication true). 

If you intended C1 and C2 to mean different times or different occurrences, clarify that distinction; as stated they are identical, so the implication holds.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, no other events can occur (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (Both events occur at some points in the timeline.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (At some future point the situation described by C1—both events having occurred—will be true.)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" (That is, from 'eventually both happen' conclude 'event1 happens'.)

4) How they relate / reasoning about C3
- By definition, C2 says that eventually both event2 and event1 happen. That directly entails that event1 happens. So, logically, C2 ⇒ event1, hence C3 is true.
- (Additional note about the scenario: given the rules, since event2 already happened and nothing can happen after event2, in fact C2 is false in this system — event1 cannot occur after the initial event2. If C2 is false then the implication C2 ⇒ event1 is vacuously true. Either way, C3 is true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (system is terminal).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (also terminal).
Because event2 happened initially, no events (including event1) can happen at any later time.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a conditional. In classical logic a conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Concretely: since C1 is false, the implication C2 is true (but it does not imply event1 actually happens).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This says that at some time (now or later) the statement C2 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 is false (event2 did happen).

- Since C2 is true now, ""C2 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: event1 happened (occurs initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus the timeline must include event1 (initially) and then event2; no further events after event2.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (the repetition adds nothing). Given the initial condition, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Formally, event2 → C2.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C3?
- From (2) we know event2 does happen (it must after event1). So the antecedent of C3 is True.
- The consequent C2 is False (from 3).
- A material implication True → False is False. Therefore C3 is False.

(If event2 had not been guaranteed to occur, C3 could be vacuously true; but given the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and that event1 did happen, event2 does occur, so C3 is false.)

(Assume a usual temporal reading: ""after"" means strictly later in time and events occur in the timeline; event occurrences are instantaneous and an event that has happened at time 0 has already occurred.)

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, the timeline is terminal — no later events (including event2) can occur.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs at some time t, then at some time > t event1 must occur).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" That asserts event2 occurs (in every possible run).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Logical disjunction: true if event1 happens or if C1 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Conjunction: true only if both event1 happens and C2 is true.

4) Relation and evaluation
- Because event1 has already happened initially, Rule A prevents any later events, so event2 cannot occur at any later time. Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false.
- C2 is true because event1 happens (so the disjunction is satisfied regardless of C1).
- C3 is the conjunction of (event1 happens) and C2. Since event1 happens and C2 is true, C3 is true.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 has already occurred, so C2 is true (event1 happens ∨ C1). C1 is false (event2 cannot occur after event1), but C3 = event1 ∧ C2 is true ∧ true = True."

Short answer: C3 is False (given the usual semantics where ""next"" requires a successor state and ""eventually"" means ""some future state"").

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterward (i.e., any state after an event1 transition must have event2).
- After event2 occurs, no further events can happen (i.e., the state after event2 is terminal — there is no successor state).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the statement ""event2 happens"" (a tautology as written). So C1 is true in any state where event2 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the temporal next operator X C1: it requires that there exists a successor state and that C1 is true in that successor.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This is the temporal eventuality F C2: there exists some (current or later) state along the run where C2 is true.

(Clarifying assumptions: standard temporal logic semantics where X phi is false in a state with no successor; F phi is true iff phi holds at some reachable state including the current one.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- C1 is true in the initial state because event2 holds initially.
- C2 requires a next state in which C1 holds. But the initial state is a state after event2 and the rules say no further events can happen, so there is no successor state. With standard semantics X C1 is false in a terminal state. Thus C2 is false in the initial (and only) state, and there is no other state where C2 could be true.
- Therefore C3 (""eventually C2"") is false — there is no state in the run where C2 holds.

So, under the given rules and standard temporal-semantics assumptions, C3 is False. If you intended a different semantics for ""next"" or allowed infinite stuttering after event2, mention that and I can re-evaluate.

Short answer: C3 is false.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (in the current/initial state) event1 has happened.
- Additional global rule: after event1 no further events can happen (and likewise after event2 no further events can happen). So the initial state is terminal — there is no successor state in which any event happens.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs, there is no successor state with more events.
- If event2 occurs, there is no successor state with more events.
- In the concrete run given, event1 already occurred and therefore there is no next state.

3) What the conditions mean (formalised)
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” — formally X(event1) (the next-time operator applied to event1).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens” — formally (X(event1)) → event1, evaluated in the same state where C2 is asserted.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — formally X( (X(event1)) → event1 ).

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because the initial state is terminal, any formula of the form X(…) (something about the next state) is false in the initial state.
- Therefore C1 = X(event1) is false.
- C2 = (X(event1)) → event1 is a material implication with a false antecedent, so C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3 = X(C2) asks whether C2 holds in the next state. There is no next state, so X(C2) is false.

Conclusion: C3 is false. (This uses the usual semantics where ""next"" is false at a terminal/last state and implication is standard material implication.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: the initial state is terminal (no next state), so X(...) formulas are false. C2 is true in the initial state (false antecedent), but C3 = X(C2) is false because there is no next state in which C2 could hold."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened (i.e., event2 occurs at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event1 occurs at some time t, then event2 must occur sometime after t.
- Rule B: If event2 occurs at time t, then no further events can occur after t (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — formally: X(event2) (event2 occurs at time 1, relative to the current time 0).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — formally: F(C1): there exists some future time t such that at that time the next state has event2 (i.e., at some t, event2 occurs at t+1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — formally: F(F(C1)): there exists some time at which C2 holds (equivalently, there exist t<u such that event2 occurs at u+1).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and Rule B makes event2 terminal, there are no occurrences of any events (neither event1 nor event2) after the initial state.
- Therefore C1 is false now (event2 does not happen in the next state), and there will never be a future time when C1 becomes true.
- Hence C2 (eventually C1) is false, and consequently C3 (eventually C2) is also false.

Note on alternate interpretations: if you instead treat ""event2 happened"" as a persistent state proposition (event2 remains true forever), then C1 would be true and C2/C3 true. The conclusion above assumes the usual interpretation that ""happened"" denotes an instantaneous occurrence and the rules disallow any further occurrences after event2.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs at time 0 and Rule B makes it terminal, so no events (including event2) can occur at time 1 or any later time. Thus C1 is never true, so C2 and therefore C3 are false."

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So starting from the initial event2 you get an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … (so event1 will occur).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is a redundant conjunction; logically C1 ≡ event1 (the same proposition twice).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Likewise C2 ≡ event1.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" i.e. C1 → C2.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition (both reduce to event1), the implication C1 → C2 is a tautology (P → P), which is always true. Independently of the transition rules, any formula of the form X → X is true. Given the context you also have that event1 does occur (because initial event2 forces event1 next), so both C1 and C2 are true in the model — that also makes C1 → C2 true.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

(If you meant different formulas for C1 and C2 — e.g., one involving event2 or a different time — say so and I’ll re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 and C2 both reduce to the same proposition (event1), so C3 is P → P, which is always true (and the context also ensures event1 occurs)."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — the occurrence of event1 makes the system terminal: no further events occur after it.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — likewise, occurrence of event2 would be terminal.
- Because event1 already happened in S0, the system is already in a terminal situation and no later event (including event2) can occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is logically equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (P or P = P).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means: in the next state (call it S1) C1 is true, i.e. event2 happens in S1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" means: it is not true that C1 holds in the next state — equivalently, event2 does not happen in the next state.

4) How they relate / truth values
- Since event1 happened in S0 and that makes the run terminal, no events happen in the next state S1. Therefore event2 does not happen in S1.
- So C1 is false in S1, hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2, therefore C3 is true.

Answer: C3 is True (vacuously). Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state (so the system starts after event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).
So once either event occurs, the system performs no further events thereafter. In particular, because event2 already happened initially, event1 never occurs in any future state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (A claim about the immediate next state.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (For all states, C1 is true.)
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" (Whenever event1 occurs, then C2 is true.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1 is false: since event2 happened in the initial state and no events happen afterward, event2 does not occur in the next state.
- C2 is false: C1 does not hold always (it already fails in the initial/next-state relation), so ""C1 always holds"" is false.
- C3 is true: the statement ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" is vacuously true because event1 never happens in any run of the system (the antecedent never becomes true). In classical/standard temporal-logic semantics an implication with a never-true antecedent is true.

(If you meant a different semantics — e.g., treating events as persistent facts or using a nonstandard implication — the evaluation could differ; under the usual instantaneous-event/material-implication reading above, C3 is True.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (in the current/initial state).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any state where event1 occurs is followed by a state where event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any state where event2 occurs is followed by a state where event1 occurs).
- Thus the system alternates: ... event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (the same proposition as C1)
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds” (C3 is the implication C1 ⇒ C2).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth of C3
- C1 and C2 are syntactically and semantically identical propositions.
- An implication p ⇒ p is a logical tautology (always true).
- In the given model, starting from the initial state where event2 just happened, the next state actually has event1 (so both C1 and C2 are false in that next state). But false ⇒ false is True, so C3 still evaluates to True.
- Therefore C3 is True (because C1 implies itself).

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., in every execution/trace considered, event1 occurs.)
- C2: same as C1 (the statement in the problem repeats the identical condition).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (an implication between the two conditions).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial condition and rules: event2 occurs initially, and that forces event1 to occur afterward, so event1 does indeed always happen. Therefore C1 is true. C2 is the same statement, so C2 is also true.
- The implication C3 (""if C1 then C2"") is true because C1 and C2 are identical (or because C1 is true and C2 is true). In either sense the implication holds.

Therefore C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (so event1 implies event2 will occur later).
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen (so event2 implies event1 will occur later).
These rules force alternating occurrences (or at least eventual occurrences) of the two events.

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (same statement as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" In logical form, C3 is C1 → C2.

4) How do these conditions relate?
- C1 and C2 are identical propositions, so C1 ↔ C2 (they have the same content).
- Therefore C3 is the implication p → p, which is always true (a tautology) in classical logic.
- Also, given the initial condition (event1 happened) and the rule ""after event1 event2 must happen,"" C1 (and thus C2) is true in this scenario; so the implication is true as well.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must happen (event1 → event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

A consequence: because event2 is terminal, once event2 has happened no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e. in the actual/allowed trace(s), event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (so C2 requires C1 true and event1 occurring)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" (implication: C2 ⇒ event2)

Step 4 — how they relate (truth values and reasoning)
- C1 is false. Reason: the initial state already has event2 and, because event2 is terminal, nothing forces event1 to occur. A valid trace is: initially event2 and then nothing — so event1 does not always happen.
- C2 is false. Reason: C2 requires C1 to be true; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 is true. Reason (two ways):
  1. Classical logical truth: the implication ""if C2 then event2"" is true vacuously because the antecedent C2 is false.
  2. By the transition rule: C2 implies event1 holds, and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" ensures event2 would follow. Either way, the implication C2 ⇒ event2 is true.

Short answer: C3 is True — under the natural temporal reading. Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially (i.e. in the current/previous state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the state where event2 occurred contains event1).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, there are no further events in later states).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given Rule A and the initial condition that event2 happened, C1 is true under the usual reading.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the implication C1 ⇒ (event2 happens). Interpreting the consequent as “event2 happens in the same (next) state or a later state” (the natural reading in this timeline).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" That asserts the implication in C2 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the initial condition and Rule A, C1 is true.
- From Rule B, after event1 occurs there can be no other events; in particular, event2 cannot occur after event1.
- Because C1 is true, the truth of C2 depends on whether event2 also happens (as required by the implication). But event2 cannot happen after event1, and the only prior occurrence of event2 is the initial one (which is not “after” C1). Under the standard temporal interpretation that the implication expects event2 to occur after or at the time of C1, the consequent is false when C1 is true. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold, so C3 is true.

Note on ambiguity: If one instead reads C2 as allowing the antecedent C1 to imply that event2 happened earlier (i.e. the implication can be satisfied by the already-occurred initial event2), then C2 could be considered true and C3 false. But given the ordinary forward-in-time reading used in the context (rules about what happens after what), the correct conclusion is C3 = True.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., event1 ⇒ event2 will occur later).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e., event2 ⇒ event1 will occur later).
(I'm reading ""must happen"" as a guarantee that the specified event will indeed occur after the other.)

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: the same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" (C1 ∨ C2).

4) How they relate / final inference
- Initially event2 happened. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will happen at some later point. So both event2 and event1 have occurred (at least once).
- Therefore C1 is true (and so is C2, since it is identical).
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction C3 (C1 ∨ C2) is true.

Conclusion: C3 is True. (This assumes the rules are guarantees of eventual occurrence; if ""must happen"" were only an obligation that could be violated, the conclusion could differ.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 has occurred initially and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 will occur, so event1 ∧ event2 holds (C1), hence C3 (C1 ∨ C2) is true."

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the system alternates: starting from the initial event1 we get event2 next, then event1, then event2, … So event2 does occur (indeed infinitely often, under these rules).

3) What the conditions mean
- “Event2 happens” means: there is (at least one) occurrence of event2.
- C1: “Event2 always happens” — a stronger claim (e.g. event2 at every time or on every step). Regardless of the exact stronger reading, it is not needed for the conclusion below.
- C2: event2 happens OR C1 holds (E2 ∨ C1).
- C3: C2 holds OR event2 happens (C2 ∨ E2).

4) How they relate / truth of C3
- Algebraically C3 = (C2 ∨ E2) = (E2 ∨ C1 ∨ E2) = (E2 ∨ C1) = C2. So C3 is equivalent to C2.
- From the initial event1 and the transition rules, event2 does happen. Therefore “event2 happens” is true, so C2 (E2 ∨ C1) is true, and hence C3 is true.

So C3 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the start/event-time-0, event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules (semantics)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means once event2 has occurred, there can be no later occurrence of any event (event2 is terminal).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That means if event1 occurs at some time t, then at some later time t' (> t) event2 must occur.

(Here I use the standard temporal reading where ""after"" means strictly later.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (Both events occur at some times.)
- C2: identical to C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is equivalent to C1 (it asserts that both identical copies are true).

Step 4 — how these relate and final truth value
- From the initial condition we know event2 does happen (true).
- Can event1 happen? Under the given rules and the standard temporal reading:
  - event1 cannot happen after event2 because after event2 no events can occur.
  - event1 cannot have happened before the initial event2, because the problem states event2 happened initially (the initial moment is the earliest time considered), so there is no earlier time for event1 to occur.
  - If you tried to make event1 occur at some time, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" would require a later event2; but event2 already happened initially, so that would violate the required ordering.
- Therefore event1 does not occur; C1 is false (and so is C2). Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is false.

Note on alternative readings: If you allowed nonstandard interpretations (e.g., events can be simultaneous, or ""after"" is non-strict or multiple occurrences are allowed), the result could differ. Under the usual strict temporal reading above, C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual temporal reading). Explanation step by step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (event1 → later event2).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event2 → later event1).
So starting from the initial event2 you get an alternating sequence: event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, … (unless you allow simultaneous occurrences, see caveat below).

3) What the Ci mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — just a redundant way of saying event1 happens (so C1 is true at times when event1 occurs, false otherwise).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — equivalent to “event1 and event2 both happen” (i.e., both true at the same time/point).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — for every time point, C2 is true (i.e., at every time both event1 and event2 hold simultaneously).

4) How they relate and the conclusion
- At the initial moment only event2 has happened, so C1 is false and C2 is false there. Therefore C2 is not true at all times, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
- More generally, with the given alternation, there are times when only event1 holds and times when only event2 holds. So C2 (both holding at the same time) does not hold at those times, so C3 cannot be true.

Caveat: If you intended different semantics — e.g. “happens” means “has happened at least once in the past” (a persistent past predicate) or you allow event1 and event2 to always co-occur simultaneously — the answer could change. Under the usual instantaneous/alternating-event reading above, C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 holds).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, then event2 follows.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred, the system is terminal — no further events, including event1, can occur afterwards.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., event1 is false/does not occur at the relevant state.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C1, so C2 means ""event1 does happen.""
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That is, in the next state it is true that event1 happens.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because the initial state already has event2 and rule B prohibits any events after event2, no events (including event1) can occur in any next state.
- Therefore in the next state event1 does not happen, so C2 (""event1 does happen"") is false in the next state.
- Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

(If you intended different temporal semantics for ""after"" or for simultaneous occurrences, say so — the conclusion depends on whether event1 could occur simultaneously with or after the initial event2 under your intended semantics. Under the usual reading above, C3 is false.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Thus the system forces an alternation: starting from event2 you get event1 next, then event2, then event1, … So event2 occurs repeatedly (infinitely often).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Read literally as a propositional implication, this is a tautology (P → P), so it is always true. If one intended a temporal reading (e.g. “if event2 happens now then event2 will happen later”), the given transition rules still ensure event2 recurs, so that temporal reading would also be satisfied from the initial condition.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true immediately (in the literal reading) — and in the temporal-reading case it becomes true as well because of the enforced alternation — C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C2.

4) Relation and final conclusion
- C2 is true, so its negation (C3) is false. Therefore C3 is False.

False

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (we start in a state where event2 happened).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (i.e., once event2 has occurred the system has no further events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, it is followed by event2).

3) Meanings of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — asserts that in the immediate successor state event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — asserts that event2 does not happen in the next state (negation of C1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — asserts that at some point in time (possibly immediately) C2 becomes true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Since we start in a state where event2 has already happened and the rule says no events occur after event2, there is no successor state in which event2 occurs. Therefore C1 is false.
- Because C1 is false, C2 (the negation of C1) is true right now.
- ""Eventually C2"" is true as soon as C2 is true; because C2 already holds in the initial state, C3 is true.

Edge cases / clarifications
- If one used a semantic where ""event2 happens in the next state"" required a next state to exist and there is no next state, C1 is still not satisfied, so the conclusion (C3 true) remains the same.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is stated that initially event2 happened).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward. (event1 -> event2)
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event2 -> event1.
- C2: identical to C1 (same implication).
- C3: C1 and C2 both hold, i.e. the implication event2 -> event1 holds (twice), so C3 is simply that event2 -> event1 holds.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final verdict)?
- The context gives event1 -> event2, but it does not give event2 -> event1. In fact, event2 is terminal (no events may occur after it), so there is no support in the context for asserting that whenever event2 happens, event1 also happens.
- C1 and C2 are the same claim; the context does not entail that claim. Because C1 is not established, C3 (the conjunction) is also not established.

Conclusion: C3 is False (not supported / not entailed by the given context).

Step 1 — what events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened initially (the system starts in a state where event1 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (the state reached after event1 is terminal: no further event occurrences).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (the state reached after event2 is also terminal).
- Given the initial condition that event1 has already happened, Rule A prevents any other event (in particular event2) from occurring in any reachable execution.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (In temporal logic: F event1 — there is some time at or after now when event1 occurs.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (G C1 — at every time point it is true that event1 will eventually happen.)
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” (¬C2)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the conclusion about C3
There is an important semantic choice that affects the answer: whether “event1 happened” is a one-time instantaneous occurrence (it is true only at the moment it occurs) or a persistent fact that remains true in all later states.

- If an occurrence is instantaneous (event1 is true only at the initial moment and does not automatically hold at later states):
  - At the initial state C1 is true (event1 already happened).
  - In later states there will be no future occurrence of event1 (because after event1 no other events can happen), so at those later states C1 would be false.
  - Therefore C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 is false, and C3 (¬C2) is true.

- If “event1 happened” is modeled as a persistent proposition (once event1 has happened, the fact event1 holds in all future states):
  - Then at every state C1 is true (there is an occurrence of event1 now or in the future because the proposition stays true).
  - So C2 is true, and C3 is false.

Summary answer (with the usual interpretation in temporal-model checks)
- Under the common interpretation that events are instantaneous and “eventually” quantifies only into the future, C3 is True.
- If you model the fact “event1 happened” as persistent, C3 is False.

If you tell me which semantics you intended (instantaneous occurrences vs. persistent facts), I’ll give a definitive single answer.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: under the usual interpretation that events are instantaneous, event1 occurs at the initial state but cannot occur again in any future state, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true initially but not at all later times; therefore C2 (always C1) is false and C3 (¬C2) is true. (If instead the fact ""event1 happened"" were modeled as persistent, C3 would be false.)"

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules (given)
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in the future.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There is some future time where event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (In the immediate successor state, it is true that event2 will eventually happen.)
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" (Both C2 is true in the current state and event2 occurs now.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event1 has already happened in the initial state and Rule A forbids any further events after event1, event2 cannot occur at any future time. So C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- Consequently, C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is also false — there is no future state in which event2 eventually happens.
- C3 requires both C2 to be true and that event2 happens; since neither is true, C3 is false.

(As a note: Rule B is vacuously satisfied here because event2 never occurs; that does not change the conclusion.)

Short answer: C3 is True (under the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
(So the system alternates: event2 → event1 → event2 → …)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (i.e., immediately following the initial state)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (so C2 = ¬C1)
- C3: “C2 holds and event1 happens.” (C3 = C2 ∧ (event1 happens))

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Since the initial state had event2 and “after event2, event1 must happen,” the next state has event1, not event2. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is “C1 does not hold,” so C2 is true.
- Because event1 does indeed happen in the next state, and C2 is true, the conjunction C3 (C2 ∧ event1) is true.

Hence C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is terminal: once event1 has happened, no further events occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is also terminal.
- Because event1 already happened initially, event2 cannot happen afterward in this scenario.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the formula event2 → event2, which is a logical tautology (always true) — any proposition implies itself.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Given the initial condition event1 happened and C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C3?
- C1 is true (tautology).
- Event1 is true by the initial condition, so C2 (event1 ∧ C1) is true.
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold, but C2 does hold; therefore C3 is false.

Extra note: Even though event2 cannot actually occur after event1, that does not affect C1 because an implication P → P is true whether P is true or false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.

2) Transition rules

- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
So the system alternates states: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ….

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just event1 (the conjunction is redundant). C1 is true exactly in states where event1 holds (s1, s3, …).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — means globally (in every state) event1 holds. That would require event1 to be true in s0, s1, s2, ….
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — means: at the next state (s1) the property C2 is true (i.e., from s1 onward event1 holds in every state).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the alternation, event1 is not true in every state (s0 and s2 are event2), so C2 is false (everywhere).
- In particular, at the next state s1, event1 does not hold in all subsequent states (s2 is event2), so C2 is false at s1.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next (so state1 has event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (the system reaches a terminal/no-event state after state1).

A simple timeline consistent with the rules:
- state0: event1 (initial)
- state1: event2
- state2: no events (terminal) — no event1 in the future of state1 or state2.

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — at a given state this is true iff event1 holds now or at some future state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — for every state reachable from the current one, C1 is true there (i.e., in every state, event1 will eventually happen).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — in the state immediately after the current one, C2 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- At state0: C1 is true (event1 has already happened).
- At state1 (the next state): event1 does not happen now, and per the rules it will not happen in any future state (state2 is terminal with no events). So at state1, C1 is false.
- Because there exists a state (state1) where C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false when evaluated at state0 (and also false at state1).
- C3 asks whether C2 is true in the next state (state1). Since we just saw C2 is false at state1, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False (counterexample: the next state after the initial one is a state where event1 will never again occur, so C2 does not hold there).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: at the next state (state1) event1 will never again occur, so C1 is false there; hence C2 (that C1 always holds) is false at state1, so C3 = X C2 is false."

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual reading that ""always"" means ""at every state""). Below is the step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initial state) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 occurs at a state, then at the immediate next state event2 must occur.
- If event2 occurs at a state, then at the immediate next state event1 must occur.
So the system forces an alternation: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ….

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (standard temporal reading)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpret as: at every state, event1 holds (i.e., globally G event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — interpret as: at the current state, X C1 (C1 is true at the immediate successor).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — interpret as: at every state, C2 holds (i.e., G(X C1)).

4) How they relate / evaluation on the alternating trace
- Look at t1: event2 holds at t1, so event1 does not hold at t1. Hence C1 (G event1) is false (it fails already at t1).
- Because C1 is false at t1, C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is false at t0 (at t0 the ""next state"" is t1 where C1 is false).
- Since C2 is false at t0, C3 (that C2 holds at every state) is false as well.

Therefore C3 is False.

Note on alternate readings: if by ""always happens"" you instead meant ""occurs infinitely often"" (the temporal property GF(event1)), then on the alternating trace GF(event1) is true, and that GF property is suffix-closed so C1, C2, C3 would all be true. But under the common meaning of ""always"" = ""at every state"", C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
(So once event1 has occurred, the next state cannot contain any further events, in particular not event2.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event1 happens then event2 happens in the next state.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" — the conjunction of C2 and the fact that event1 happened.

4) How they relate / truth values
- Given the transition rule, since event1 happened initially, no other events can happen next. Therefore C1 (event2 happens next) is false.
- C2 is the implication (event1 → C1). The antecedent (event1) is true, the consequent (C1) is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 is false.
- C3 is C2 ∧ event1. event1 is true but C2 is false, so the conjunction is false.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.

2) Transition rules

- After event1, no other events can occur (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = at every time point C2 is true (equivalently, C1 is never true).

4) Relation and evaluation
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 is true at the initial time. Therefore C2 (¬C1) is false at the initial time.
- Because C2 is false at that time, C3 (""C2 always holds"") cannot be true — it requires C2 to be true at every time, but it already fails at the initial time.
- (Additional note: given the transition rules, event1 will also occur after event2, so C1 remains true at least at those times; either way C1 is true somewhere, so C2 is not always true.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time 0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
So the system must alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... starting from the initial event1.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (interpreting them as state formulas / temporal properties)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Temporal X event2.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" i.e. (X event2) ∨ event1, evaluated in a given state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" i.e. G( (X event2) ∨ event1 ).

4) How they relate and truth value of C3
- Write the infinite sequence of states (events present in each state): S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, ...
- Evaluate C2 in each state:
  - In states where event1 holds (S0, S2, ...): event1 is true, so C2 is true (the disjunction holds).
  - In states where event2 holds (S1, S3, ...): event1 is false in that state. Is C1 true there? C1 asks that event2 holds in the next state — but after event2 the next state is event1, so C1 is false. Thus in those states both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.
- Since there are states (every state with event2) where C2 is false, C2 does not hold in all states. Therefore C3 (= ""C2 always holds"") is false. A counterexample is any state where event2 occurs (e.g., S1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: starting from event1 the system alternates 1,2,1,2,...; in a state where event2 holds (e.g. S1) event1 is false and ""X event2"" is false because the next state is event1, so C2 is false there. Hence C2 is not true in all states, so C3 (G C2) is false."

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So as soon as either event happens, the system produces no further events.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just the same as ""event2 happens"" (a tautology/redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" means event2 happens AND event1 happens (both must have occurred at some point).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means at some time in the future C2 becomes true (i.e., eventually both events have occurred).

4) How they relate and final truth value of C3
- From (1) we know event2 already happened initially, so C1 is true.
- But because event2 happened and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event1) can occur after that point. The only way C2 could be true is if event1 had already occurred as well (either earlier or simultaneously).

- Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event2 happens (it has already happened).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to just ""event1 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — this requires both event2 and event1 to have happened.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — asks whether at some point both event2 and event1 will have happened.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- event2 has already happened initially.
- Could event1 also happen?
  - It cannot happen after event2, because after event2 no other events can happen.
  - It cannot have happened before event2, because if event1 had happened earlier then, by ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event2 could not have happened afterwards — contradicting the given that event2 did happen initially.
  - Therefore there is no allowed time at which event1 could have occurred.
- Since event1 cannot occur, C1 is false, so C2 (which requires both event2 and event1) is false, and hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

(If one allowed simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment and that were explicitly stated, both could be true; but under the usual reading of the given statements, simultaneous occurrence is not assumed, so C3 is false.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means whenever event2 occurs, event1 will (or must) occur afterward (event2 ⇒ event1).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means event1 ⇒ event2.
- Together these give mutual future implication: occurrence of either forces the occurrence of the other (they will keep occurring as required).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is p ⇒ p, a tautology, so C1 is always true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given the initial condition, event1 does happen, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C2 is true (because event1 happened and C1 is true), therefore C3 (the claim that C2 does not hold) is false.

Final answer: C3 is False.

False

Short answer: C3 is False.

Explanation step-by-step (with the natural interpretations below):

Assumptions I use
- ""Initially, event2 happened"" means at the initial moment event2 has occurred and we start from a state where event2 is true.
- ""After X, Y must happen"" means if X occurs at some time then at some later point Y occurs.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means event2 is terminal: once event2 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences after that point.
- ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) means event1 holds at every moment (a global/always property). ""event1 happens"" in C2 is read as the atomic fact ""event1 occurs at the current moment."" C3 (“C2 eventually holds”) means at some time in the future C2 is true.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 has occurred. Because event2 is terminal (see below), no events occur after that initial time.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs at some time, then event2 must occur afterward (so event1 → later event2).
- If event2 occurs, no other events can occur after it (event2 is terminal). Since event2 already occurred initially, there are no further events at all.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — under the usual reading this is false here because we do not have event1 occurring at every moment (indeed it never occurs after the initial event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — at any particular moment C2 is true iff either C1 is true (a global claim) or event1 occurs at that moment. Given C1 is false, C2 reduces to ""event1 occurs now.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some time at which C2 is true (i.e., at some time either C1 is true or event1 occurs; with C1 false, this reduces to: event1 occurs at some time).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial terminal event2, no further events can occur. Therefore event1 never occurs at any later time.
- Hence C1 is false (event1 does not always happen).
- Hence C2 is always false (because it reduces to ""event1 occurs now"", which never happens).
- Therefore C3 (""eventually C2"") is false: there is no time at which C2 becomes true.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (event1 is true in the scenario).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — this implies that, given event1 has happened, event2 will (or must) happen. So event2 is true in this timeline.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal, but that does not prevent event2 itself from occurring.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens. Given steps above, both are true, so C1 is true.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. Formally C2 is the implication (event2 → C1).
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens. Formally C3 is (C2 ∧ event2).

4) How do these conditions relate and which are true?
- From (1) and (2) we have event1 = true and event2 = true, so C1 = (true ∧ true) = true.
- Since C1 is true, the implication (event2 → C1) is true (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent). Also, here the antecedent event2 is actually true, so the implication is true because both antecedent and consequent are true. Therefore C2 = true.
- Finally C3 = (C2 ∧ event2) = (true ∧ true) = true.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, it is followed at some later time by event1.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, it is followed at some later time by event2.)
These are rules of necessity for future occurrences.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This restates the rule “after event1, event2 must happen.” So C1 is true under the given rules.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says the rule in C1 is universally true (it holds whenever event1 happens). Given the context statement “After event1, event2 must happen,” C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This is the conjunction: (C2 is true) AND (event2 occurs).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the context we have both (a) the rule that ensures C1, hence C2 is satisfied, and (b) the initial fact that event2 has happened.
- Therefore both parts of the conjunction in C3 are true, so C3 is true.

Note: This conclusion assumes the ordinary reading of ""must happen"" as a persistent rule (so C1 always holds) and that the initial ""event2 happened"" supplies the second conjunct. If you intended different temporal/logical readings, say local/one-off rules, state that and I can re-evaluate.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event2 has happened.
- Extra rules: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — each event, once it has occurred, makes all future states have no further events.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event2 happens in S0 and ""after event2 no other events can happen"", every future state (S1, S2, ...) has no events.
- If event1 ever happened in some state, the same would hold (no further events afterwards). But given the initial event2 in S0, event1 cannot occur in any future state.

3) What each condition means
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Formally, at a state S, C1 = X(event1) — event1 holds in the immediate successor state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally, C2 = X(C1) = X X(event1) — event1 holds two steps ahead.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Formally, C3 = G(C2) — at every state, C2 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- At S0, event2 has happened, so by the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"", the successor S1 has no events. Therefore event1 is not true in S1, so C1 is false at S0.
- C2 at S0 asks whether C1 is true in S1 (i.e., whether event1 is true in S2). But since no events ever occur after S0 (because event2 already happened), event1 is false in S2 as well, so C1 is false in S1 and thus C2 is false at S0.
- C3 asserts that C2 holds at every state. But C2 is already false at the initial state S0, so C3 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False (because event2 occurring initially prevents event1 from ever happening, making C1 and C2 false and thus C3 false).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because event2 has already happened in the initial state and prevents any future events, C1 (X event1) is false at S0, so C2 (XX event1) is false at S0 and thus G(C2) (C3) is false."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- From event1, event2 must happen (i.e. after event1, event2 inevitably occurs at some later point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus the only possible execution is: event1 (initial) → event2 (later) → stop.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just a tautology/redundant way of saying event1 happens. Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This is true at the moment when event2 occurs (C1 already holds because event1 happened).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This says that at some time in the future C2 will be true.

4) How they relate
- Since event1 holds initially, C1 holds.
- By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will occur at some time.
- At that time, both C1 and event2 hold, so C2 holds at that time.
- Therefore C2 holds at some future time, so C3 (that C2 eventually holds) is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start/time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
(So each occurrence forces the other to occur next — this produces an alternation: e1 → e2 → e1 → ….)

Step 3 — what C1, C2, C3 mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There exists a future time at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (The conjunction: event2 will eventually occur, and event2 occurs. In practice the second conjunct is redundant with the first once an occurrence happens.)
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" (Disjunction of event2 occurring and the conjunction C2.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C3
- From the rules and the initial e1, we get the timeline: at time 0 e1, at time 1 e2, at time 2 e1, etc. So event2 does occur (indeed immediately after e1).
- Therefore C1 is true (event2 eventually happens).
- Since event2 does occur, the conjunction in C2 is also true, so C2 is true.
- C3 is ""event2 happens OR C2 holds."" Because event2 does happen, the disjunction is true. (Also C2 already true, so C3 is true either way.)

Conclusion: C3 is True.

Note on ambiguity: If you interpret ""happens"" in C2/C3 as ""happens right now"" rather than ""happens sometime,"" then at the initial moment C2 would be false (event2 hasn't happened yet) and C3 would be false at that initial instant.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (This is exactly the conditional ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"".)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (They alternate.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (This matches Rule A.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. C1 is false.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (i.e. C2 is false, equivalently ¬(¬C1).)

4) Relation among them and conclusion
- C3 = not(C2) = not(not C1) = C1. So C3 is logically equivalent to C1.
- The context gives Rule A, so C1 is true. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is false, and C3 (the negation of C2) is true.

Thus C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true in the scenario).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: if event1 occurs then nothing else can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal as well.
Together these mean once event2 has occurred no further events (including event1) can occur after it.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — logical conjunction: event2 ∧ event1.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — disjunction: event2 ∨ C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — negation: ¬C2.

4) Evaluation and relation
- From the initial condition, event2 is true.
- Because event2 is terminal (no other events after it), event1 does not (and cannot) happen in this scenario → event1 is false.
- C1 = event2 ∧ event1 = True ∧ False = False.
- C2 = event2 ∨ C1 = True ∨ False = True.
- C3 = ¬C2 = ¬True = False.

So C3 is False.

(If you instead allow event1 to have occurred before event2 or allow simultaneous occurrence, the truth values could differ; with the plain reading given, C3 is false.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event1 holds.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. (If event2 holds at time t, then event1 holds at t+1.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. (If event1 holds at time t, then event2 holds at t+1.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Formally, at a state t, C1 means X event1 (event1 holds at t+1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Formally, G(C1) — at every state t, X event1 holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Formally, G(C2). (But G(G(X event1)) is equivalent to G(X event1), so this is just another global claim that X event1 holds at every state.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the rules and the initial state t0: event1 at t0 implies by Rule B that event2 at t1. Then by Rule A, event1 at t2, then event2 at t3, etc. So the trace alternates: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, ...
- Evaluate C1 at t0: C1 requires event1 at t1, but t1 has event2, so C1 is false at t0.
- Because C1 is false at t0, C2 = ""C1 always holds"" is false (it fails already at t0).
- Because C2 is false, C3 = ""C2 always holds"" is also false.

Therefore C3 is False. (If you intended a different reading of ""after"" — e.g. ""eventually after"" instead of ""in the next state"" — tell me and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

False

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 → event2).
- After event2 happens no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

(These rules do not affect the logical truth of the formulas below beyond telling us that event2 does indeed occur initially.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally event2 → event2. In classical logic this is a tautology (always true).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Formally C1 ∨ event2. Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true regardless of whether event2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Formally ¬C2.

4) How they relate and final truth values
- C1 is true (tautology).
- Therefore C2 = (true) ∨ event2 = true.
- Hence C3 = ¬C2 = ¬true = false.

So C3 is false. (Note: this conclusion does not rely on the initial occurrence of event2 — C1 is true in any case — but is consistent with the given initial condition.)

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
So once event2 occurs (as it does initially), there are no further events in any following state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (True iff event2 occurs immediately after the initial state.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (An implication: C1 → event1.)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" (A disjunction: C2 ∨ event1.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1 is false: since event2 already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no events (including event2) occur in the next state.
- C2 is true: the implication C1 → event1 is vacuously true because its antecedent C1 is false.
- Therefore C3 = (C2 ∨ event1) is true (true ∨ anything = true).

Conclusion: C3 is True.

(If you adopt a nonstandard semantics where a terminal event ""persists"" into the next state, the value of C1 could differ; under the usual reading above, C3 is True.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” So any state reached by event1 is terminal (has no successor).
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” So any state reached by event2 is also terminal.
- Because the initial state has event2, we are in a terminal state with no next state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” Logically this is p → p for p = “event2 happens.” That is a tautology and therefore true in any state where it is well-formed.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” This is the negation of C1, so it is false in any state where C1 is true.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” This asserts that in the (immediate) successor state, C2 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1 is true (tautology).
- C2 is false (negation of a true statement).
- There is no next state after the initial event2 (the state is terminal). Under the usual temporal “next” semantics (X φ is false at a terminal state), C3 is false because there is no successor state in which C2 could hold.
- Therefore C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (p → p for p = ""event2"") is true, so C2 (¬C1) is false. The initial state is terminal (no successor after event2), so ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it holds initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"": once event2 has occurred, event1 will (inevitably) occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"": event1 is terminal — once it happens nothing else can happen after it.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the initial condition and the rule after event2, this is the case.
- C2: Same as C1 (it is identical text: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"").
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" This is the disjunction of two identical true statements.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the initial condition and the rules we get the timeline: event2 (initial) → event1 → end. So event2 happens and event1 happens.
- Therefore C1 is true, C2 is true (they are identical), and the disjunction C3 is true.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at time t0).

2) Transition rules
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.
- “After event1, event2 must happen” — whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward.
(So an occurrence of one forces the other to occur next.)

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event1 happens.” This is a self-implication (event1 → event1). As a logical/mathematical statement it is a tautology: it is always true whenever interpreted as material implication.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Since C1 is a tautology, C1 does indeed hold at all times, so C2 is true.
- C3: “Event2 happens and C2 holds.” This requires (a) event2 occurs at some point, and (b) C2 holds.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event1 (t0) and the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 will occur (at some later time, say t1). Thus event2 does happen.
- We already concluded C2 is true.
- Therefore both parts of C3 are satisfied.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

(Only caveat: if “must happen” were interpreted as non-enforceable possibility rather than a guaranteed consequence, or if the logic behind C1/C2 were given a different/temporal reading, the conclusion could differ. Under the normal reading above, C3 is true.)

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Meaning if event2 ever occurs at some time t, then at some (or the next) later time event1 must occur.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Meaning once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This is a conjunction that requires both events to occur (at whatever times).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Conjunction requiring event1 to happen now (or sometime) and also that C1 is true in the next state.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C3?
- From the initial condition, event1 has already happened at the start. By Rule B, after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur at any later time (there are no later events).
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is false: event1 does happen, but event2 does not.
- If C1 is false in the current state, it cannot be true in the next state either (since no events can occur after event1). So C2 is false.
- C3 is the conjunction of ""event1 happens"" (true) and C2 (false), so C3 is false.

(If one adopted a different semantics where events can be simultaneous or the timeline extends before the initial state, the answer could change; under the plain reading given above, C3 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 has already occurred and by Rule B no further events can happen, so event2 cannot occur. Thus C1 is false (event2 doesn't happen), C2 is false, and C3 (true ∧ false) is false."

Answering step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules (how events force others)
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. whenever event1 occurs, eventually event2 will occur).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, eventually event1 will occur).

(So each occurrence of one event forces an occurrence of the other sometime later.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is a statement about the run: there is some time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication: if event2 eventually happens, then (somewhere) event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Read as: the implication in C2 is true (holds) in the system/run (i.e. at all relevant times).

4) How they relate and final truth value of C3
- Because event1 happened initially, Rule A forces that event2 will occur at some later time. So C1 is true in this system.
- Given C1 (event2 does occur), Rule B guarantees that after that event2 there will be an occurrence of event1. Also, event1 already occurred initially. So the implication in C2 (""if event2 eventually happens then event1 happens"") is true.
- The two rules are invariant: whenever event2 occurs an event1 will follow; whenever event1 occurs an event2 will follow. Therefore the implication C2 holds in the run and there is no point at which it can be violated. Hence C2 ""always holds"" — C3 is True.

Concrete timeline example: t0: event1 (initial) → by Rule A at some t1: event2 → by Rule B at some t2: event1 → etc. So event2 does eventually happen (C1 true), C2 holds, and therefore C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., from any state where event1 has occurred, event2 inevitably occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (reads as: in the given scenario/event model, event2 will occur.)
- C2: the same statement as C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — the disjunction of the two identical claims.

4) How they relate / final inference
- From the initial condition (event1 occurred) and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 will indeed occur. So C1 is true. C2 is the same, so C2 is true as well.
- The disjunction C3 (C1 or C2) is therefore true (in fact both disjuncts are true).

(If by ""always happens"" you meant something different — e.g., ""is true at every moment after now"" rather than ""will occur"" — let me know and I can adapt the reasoning. Under the usual reading here, C3 is True.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, the trace is terminal; no future events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point from the initial state).
- C2: same as C1 (it's the same statement repeated).
- C3: C1 or C2 — logically equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens"" (since C1 and C2 are identical).

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen at any future time from the initial state. Therefore C1 is False, C2 is False, and their disjunction C3 is False.

(If you meant a different temporal reading — e.g., allowing histories where event1 occurs before event2, or interpreting ""eventually"" as “sometime in the past or future” — the answer could change. Under the usual reading from the given initial state, C3 is False.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (what can happen after each event)?
- After event1, no other events can happen. That prevents event2 from occurring after the initial event1.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This rule is moot here because event2 never gets to happen given the first rule.)

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., event2 occurs — at least once or at every state depending on intended reading; in any reasonable reading this asserts that event2 does occur.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (the property C1 is true in the state following the current one.)
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" (conjunction: both C2 is true and event2 occurs.)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Since initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later point. Therefore any claim that event2 happens (C1) is false.
- If C1 is false, then C2 (""C1 in the next state"") is also false.
- C3 requires both C2 and event2 to be true; both are false here, so C3 is false.

(If you use a temporal logic where ""next"" is undefined in a terminal state, you still cannot make C1 true afterward, so C2 and hence C3 remain false.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” So once event1 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences (no transitions that produce events).
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” So if event2 occurs, that also leads to a terminal situation with no further events.
- Together with the initial condition (event1 already happened), the system is already in a situation where no further events can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” This asserts that at some future point (possibly now or later) event2 will occur.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” This asserts that in the immediate successor state, C1 is true (i.e., from the next state, event2 will eventually occur).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” This asserts that in the successor of the successor (two steps ahead from the current state), C2 is true (i.e., in that state C1 would hold in its next state).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is their truth value?
- Because event1 has already occurred and “after event1 no other events can happen,” no further events, including event2, can ever happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- If C1 is false in the current state, then C2 (""C1 in the next state"") is also false: there is no way for event2 to become true later. (Under usual semantics where “next” requires an actual successor, there is no successor with event2; under any reasonable semantics the eventual occurrence of event2 cannot be satisfied.)
- Since C2 is false, C3 (""C2 in the next state"") is also false.

Conclusion: C3 is False. (Note: this conclusion holds under standard temporal semantics — even if you treat “next” differently, the impossibility of event2 after event1 makes C1 false, propagating falsity to C2 and C3.)

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.
- Additional constraints: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. (So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once one of them happens, no further events occur after that point.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs at some state, there are no subsequent states in which any event occurs (no further events after event1).
- Likewise, if event2 occurs at some state, there are no subsequent states in which any event occurs.
- In particular, because event1 occurs initially, there is no later state in which event2 can occur (unless you allow events to have happened earlier or simultaneously — see assumptions below).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (Both events occur at some time(s).)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (In the successor state, both event1 and event2 hold.)
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" (Whenever event1 happens, in the next state C1 holds.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C3 true?
- Given the initial event1 and the rule that after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later state. There is no earlier state before the initial one, so the only way to satisfy C1 would be if event2 also happened simultaneously with event1 in the same state — but even then C2 requires that C1 hold in the next state, and by the ""after event1 no other events can happen"" rule the next state cannot contain event2 (or any event). Thus C1 is not true in any reachable later state, so C2 is false.
- Since event1 actually happens (initially) and C2 is false, the implication ""if event1 happens then C2 holds"" is false (true antecedent, false consequent).
- Therefore C3 is False.

Note on assumptions:
- I used the usual temporal logic reading where ""after"" means strictly later states, events are instantaneous occurrences in states, and the ""next"" operator requires an actual successor state (in standard LTL, X φ is false at a final state). If you use a nonstandard model (e.g., allowing simultaneous co-occurrence of events in the initial state and treating ""next"" as vacuously true at a final state), the truth values could differ, but under the normal interpretation above C3 is false.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 is forced sometime after event1.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- No other transitions are given.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This states the implication from event1 to event2 (a rule about what must occur after event1).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This is a conjunction: both the implication C1 is true and event2 actually happens.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that C2 is true at every moment / in every state (the usual reading of “always” = globally).

4) How they relate and truth values
- C1 is true: it just restates the given rule “after event1, event2 must happen.”
- Does event2 happen? Yes: since event1 already happened and the rule requires event2 after event1, event2 will occur (and then no further events occur).
- Therefore C2 becomes true once event2 has occurred (and C1 is true anyway). However, C2 is not true at times before event2 occurs.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") under the standard temporal reading (always = at every time point) is false: at the initial time (after event1 but before event2) C2 is false because event2 has not yet happened. So C2 does not hold at every moment, hence C3 is false.

(If by ""always"" one instead meant ""inevitably / in every possible execution C2 will eventually be true,"" then that weaker inevitability claim is true — but that is not the usual meaning of the word ""always"".)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: ""Always"" = at every moment. C2 (which requires event2 to have happened) is false at times after event1 but before event2 occurs, so C2 does not hold at every moment and C3 is false. (If ""always"" were read as ""in every execution eventually,"" that weaker claim would be true.)"

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime afterwards.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, no further events (neither event1 nor event2) can occur in any later state.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: in the current trace, at or after the current state event1 will occur at some point.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" That is, event2 occurs (at the relevant state) and (separately) event1 eventually happens somewhere on the trace.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C3 asserts that in the immediate next state, C2 is true (so in that next state event2 occurs there and event1 eventually happens from that point).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 has already happened in the initial state and rule B forbids any events after event1, no further events can occur in any successor states. In particular, event2 cannot occur in the next state (or any later state) after the initial event1.
- Therefore C2 cannot be true in the next state (it requires event2 to happen there). Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Note on alternative readings: even if you interpret ""eventually"" strictly as “at some strictly later state” (so C1 would be false because no events occur after the initial event1), the same conclusion follows: C2 is false and thus C3 is false. So under the natural interpretations, C3 is False.

Reason: C2 says C1 holds always (i.e. in every state). C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state. So under the assumption C2, C1 holds now, hence event1 happens in the next state.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (event2 is terminal; once event2 has occurred, there are no subsequent events.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event1 does not happen in the next state.)
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" (i.e., both that event1 does not happen in the next state, and that event1 does happen — a conjunction of a denial and an occurrence.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since the initial state already has event2, and rule B says no events can happen after event2, the next state cannot contain any event, so event1 cannot happen there. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2, which asserts C1 does not hold, is true.
- C3 requires both C2 (true) and that event1 happens (false). A conjunction with a false conjunct is false, so C3 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 → event1, i.e. if event2 occurs then event1 will occur afterwards.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 → event2.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” This is exactly the rule event1 → event2.
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens.” That is (event1 → event2) ∨ event1.
- C3: “C2 holds and event1 happens.” That is ((event1 → event2) ∨ event1) ∧ event1.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- From the transition rule after event1, event2 must happen, so C1 is true.
- Because C1 is true, the disjunction in C2 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3 requires C2 to be true and event1 to happen. C2 is already true; whether C3 is true therefore depends on whether event1 happens.
- From the initial condition (event2 happened) plus the rule after event2 → event1, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen.
- Therefore C3 is true (in fact, it becomes true once event1 occurs).

Note on timing: if you evaluate C3 at a moment before event1 has occurred, C3 would be false then (because event1 hasn’t happened yet). Given the rules and the initial event2, event1 will occur, and at/after that moment C3 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 holds (event1 → event2). Hence C2 = C1 ∨ event1 is true. Given initial event2 and the rule (event2 → event1), event1 does occur, so C3 = C2 ∧ event1 is true."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs in some state, the immediately following state must have event1.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — whenever event1 occurs in some state, the next state has no events (so neither event1 nor event2 occurs there).

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — a statement about the immediate successor state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — for every state, the successor state has event1 (i.e., C1 is true in every state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Evaluate at the initial state (where event1 happened). By Rule B, after event1 no other events can happen, so in the next state (state 1) there are no events. Therefore C1 is false at the initial state.
- Because C1 is false at least at the initial state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 is the statement ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.

So C3 is True. (Note: in some other states where event2 just occurred, C1 would be true because of Rule A, but that does not make C2 true globally.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition (state0): event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 (i.e. in the next state, state1) event1 must happen.
- After event1 no other events can happen (state1 is terminal; state2 has no events).

So the timeline is: state0: event2. state1: event1. state2: no events.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 ≡ ""event2 happens"".
  - True in state0 (because event2 happened), false in state1 and later.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At state0 this asserts ""C1 is true in state1"", i.e. ""event2 happens in state1"". But by the transition rule state1 has event1, not event2, so C2 is false when evaluated at state0.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" At a given state this is true if either C2 is true there or event1 happens there.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- At the initial state (state0): C1 is true, but C2 is false (because event2 does not occur in state1). event1 does not happen in state0, so C3 = (false or false) = false. 
- At state1: event1 happens, so C3 is true there regardless of C2.

Conclusion
- C3 is false when evaluated at the initial state. It becomes true in the next state (the state where event1 occurs).

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
So the timeline is forced to alternate: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ….

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; it is equivalent to the proposition ""event2 happens"" at the current time.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as the temporal always (□), C2 = □C1, i.e. C1 is true at every time point.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C3 = □C2. In linear temporal logic, □□φ ≡ □φ, so C3 is equivalent to C2.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the timeline: event2 is true at t1, t3, t5, … (odd times) and false at t0, t2, t4, … (even times).
- Therefore C1 is not true at every time (false at even times), so C2 = □C1 is false.
- Since C3 ≡ C2, C3 is also false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (we start in a state after event2 happened).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 ⇒ event2).
- Rule B: If event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant disjunction; it is equivalent to: event1 happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — since C1 ≡ event1, C2 ≡ (event1 and event1) ≡ event1. So C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this asserts that C2 is true at all relevant times (i.e., event1 happens always).

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluate under the rules?
- Because we begin after event2 has happened and event2 is terminal (no further events possible), event1 cannot happen at any time after the initial state.
- Therefore C1 (event1 happens) is false, C2 (equivalent to event1) is false.
- Consequently, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Final conclusion: C3 is False under the given initial condition and rules. (If you intended a different timing/ordering interpretation — e.g., event1 could have occurred before the initial event2 — state that and we can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurred, the future contains no further events).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal if it ever occurs).

3) Meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (there exists a future state where event2 occurs).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e. event1 → eventually event2).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (the implication in C2 is true at all times / in every state).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule says no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. So C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that if event1 happens then event2 will eventually happen. But in our actual run event1 does happen and event2 does not, so the implication is false (true antecedent, false consequent). Thus C2 is false at the initial point.
- Since C2 is false at least at the initial point, the universal claim C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Step 0 — restating the context in one line:
- Initially event1 has occurred. From any state where event1 has occurred, event2 must occur at some later point. Once event2 occurs, no further events can occur.

Now the four requested steps.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state (so the system starts with event1 having occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 has occurred, event2 must occur afterward (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2 occurs, the system is terminal: no further events can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., at no future point does event2 occur)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (a disjunction: either event1 happens, or event2 never happens)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (C2 is true at every point in time / in every state)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and is C3 true or false)?
- From the context: because event1 happened initially and the rule says that after event1 event2 must happen, event2 will in fact happen at some later point. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is ""event1 happens or C1"". Since event1 did happen initially, C2 is true at least at the initial state.
- Whether C2 is true “always” (C3) depends on how you read “event1 happens”:
  - If “event1 happens” is a factual property that remains true once it has occurred (i.e., “event1 has happened” is true at all subsequent states), then C2 is true at every state (because the left disjunct remains true), so C3 is true.
  - If instead “event1 happens” is only true at the instant of its occurrence and not at later times, then after that instant the left disjunct is false and C1 is false too (since event2 will happen). So C2 would be false at those later times, and C3 would be false.

Most natural readings of “Initially, event1 happened” treat that as a persistent fact (“event1 has happened”), so under that reading C3 is True. If you intended a momentary interpretation of “happens,” then C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: with the natural reading that ""event1 happened"" is a persistent fact (once happened it remains true), the left disjunct of C2 is always true, so C2 holds at every state and hence C3 is True. (If ""happens"" were only instantaneous, C3 would be False.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially (i.e. at the start of the execution/run).

Step 2 — transition/temporal rules
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has occurred, the system produces no further events.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 ever occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (A claim that event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" (Both: event2 does not happen, and event1 happens.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (C2 is true at all times/throughout the run — i.e. C2 holds globally.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- The initial condition says event2 does happen (initially). Therefore C1 is false (it contradicts the given initial event2).
- C2 requires C1 to be true, so C2 is false (regardless of whether event1 happens).
- C3 asserts that C2 always holds; since C2 is already false (at the start), C3 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event2 happened.

(Assumption used below: ""After X"" means ""in the immediately next state after a state where X holds"".)

2) Transition rules
- If event1 holds at time t, then event2 must hold at time t+1.
- If event2 holds at time t, then event1 must hold at time t+1.

These force alternation of the required events along time.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 holds now"".
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — means both event2 and event1 hold in the same state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — C2 must be true at time t+1 (relative to the current state).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At t0: event2 holds (given), so C1 is true at t0. event1 does not hold at t0, so C2 is false at t0.
- From the rule, because event2 holds at t0, event1 must hold at t1. So at t1 we have event1.
- At t1: event1 holds, but event2 does not (the alternation gives e2 at t0, e1 at t1, e2 at t2, ...), so C1 is false at t1. Since C2 requires both event1 and event2 in the same state, C2 is false at t1.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"", i.e. C2 true at t1) is false.

(If you allowed arbitrary simultaneous occurrences of event1 and event2 in a state regardless of the rules, one could imagine a model where both hold together; but given the initial condition and the ""after"" rules interpreted as next-state obligations, C2 never holds at any state here, so C3 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From t0 with event2, the rules force alternation: t0: e2, t1: e1, t2: e2, ... . C2 requires both e1 and e2 to hold in the same state, which never happens, so C2 is false at t1; therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, there are no further events afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (This says that if event2 were to occur, it would also block any later events.)
Given event1 has already happened initially, the rule after event1 prevents any other events from ever occurring after that point (so event2 cannot occur subsequently).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is a disjunction; it is true if at least one of the two events has happened.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That means at some time (now or later) C2 becomes true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From (1) we know event1 has happened, so C1 is true (because event1 happened).
- Hence C2, which is ""C1 does not hold"", is false now.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, nothing can change C1 from true to false later; C1 stays true forever.
- Therefore C2 never becomes true at any future time, so ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is false.

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus both event1 and event2 are terminal: if either occurs, no further events occur afterwards.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event2 cannot occur after event1, so C1 is true in this situation.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally: (event2 does not happen) -> (event2 happens). That is an implication whose antecedent (C1) is true, but whose consequent (event2 happens) is false (from the context). So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that C2 is true. Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

4) How the conditions relate:
- Because event1 happened initially and prevents any further events, event2 does not happen (C1 true).
- C2 would require that from C1 being true we derive event2, which contradicts the context; therefore C2 is false.
- Consequently, C3 (the claim that C2 always holds) is false. 

(If you intended a different reading of ""always holds"" or of ""initially"" — e.g., quantifying over possible runs rather than the single given run — mention that and I can reinterpret.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Because event1 happened and prevents event2, C1 is true and the implication C2 (C1 -> event2) is then false (true antecedent, false consequent). Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the start of the run) event2 happened. No information says event1 happened before that, so assume event1 did not occur earlier.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur later (event1 → eventually event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e., in the run, occurrence of event2 implies occurrence of event1 somewhere.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future point it becomes true that event2 implies event1.)
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" (i.e., occurrence of event2 implies that eventually C1 will hold.)

4) Relations and evaluation
- Because event2 happens initially and event2 is terminal, no further events can ever occur after that initial event2.
- There is no rule guaranteeing event1 occurred before that initial event2, so in the actual run event1 does not occur. Hence C1 is false (event2 occurred but event1 did not).
- Since no events can occur after the initial event2, C1 can never become true later, so C2 is false.
- C3 requires that whenever event2 happens, C2 holds. But event2 did happen while C2 is false, so the implication event2 → C2 is false. Therefore C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially (at the current state) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen in any later state.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen in any later state.
(So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once one has happened, no further events occur.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” — i.e., event1 occurs at the next time step.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., event1 does not occur in the next state.
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens” — the disjunction: either event1 does not occur next, or event2 occurs next (or both).

4) How they relate (deduction)
- Because event1 has already happened and “after event1 no other events can happen,” no events (including event1 again or event2) can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not happen next).
- Hence C2 is true.
- event2 does not happen next (false), but C3 is a disjunction with C2 true, so C3 is true.

Note: This conclusion assumes “happens in the next state” means an event occurrence at that next time step (not persistence of a past fact). Under that standard reading, C3 is True.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?

Step 0 — quick summary answer
- C3 is True (given the stated initial condition and transition rules).

Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (call that state0: event2 = true, event1 = false).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
These force alternation: from event2 at state0 you must go to event1 at state1, then event2 at state2, and so on.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Evaluated at state0: asks whether event2 is true at state1.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (At state0: true iff event1 is true at state1, or C1 is true.)
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" (At state0: true iff event1 is true at state1, or C2 is true.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the rules, state1 must have event1 = true (because state0 had event2). Thus:
  - C1 = (event2 at state1) = false.
  - C2 = (event1 at state1) OR C1 = true OR false = true.
  - C3 = (event1 at state1) OR C2 = true OR true = true.
So C3 is True. (More simply: because event1 happens in the next state, any ""or"" that includes ""event1 happens"" is true.)

True

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is terminal: once event1 has happened, the trace stops and nothing else can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Likewise event2 would be terminal.
- Since event1 already happened initially and it is terminal, event2 cannot occur after that.

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — taken here to mean event1 occurs in the actual (and thus all possible) execution(s).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — the implication: whenever C1 is true, event2 must occur.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — the implication C2 is true in all executions.

4) How do these conditions relate?
- From the context, event1 does happen (initially) and prevents any further events, so C1 is true.
- Given C1 is true, C2 would require event2 to occur, but event2 cannot occur because event1 already blocked further events. So C2 is false.
- Since C2 is false, the claim that ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the initial moment. There is no statement that event2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can ever occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" → likewise, event2 would also be terminal if it ever occurred.
- Together these make both event1 and event2 terminal events. But because event1 already happened initially, that blocks any later occurrences of any event.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant phrasing; it is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (call that proposition p).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" In temporal logic notation, C2 = G p (globally/always p).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" In temporal logic, C3 = F G p (eventually there is a time from which p holds forever).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and final truth-value of C3?
- From the initial facts, event2 (p) does not hold initially and cannot occur later because event1 already happened and forbids any further events. So p is false at all times.
- Therefore C1 is false (p is false), C2 (G p) is false, and there is no future time at which C2 becomes true. Hence C3 (F G p) is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened the system produces no further events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (this only matters if event1 ever occurs).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (i.e., from the current state, in the immediate successor state an occurrence of event2 happens.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” (i.e., in the immediate successor state, it is true that event2 happens in *that* successor’s immediate successor.)
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” (i.e., C2 is false in the current state.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event2 already happened initially and the rule “after event2 no other events can happen” forbids any further events, no occurrence of event2 (or any event) can happen in any subsequent state.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- Since C1 is false in every state after the initial one, C2 is also false (it asserts that C1 holds in the next state).
- C3 states that C2 does not hold; since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Since event2 has already happened and no events can occur afterward, event2 cannot happen in the next state (C1 is false). Thus C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is false, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true."

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given event2 has already occurred, C1 is true (it has happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" This is a disjunction; since event2 has happened (and C1 is true), C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2.

4) Relations and conclusion
- C2 is true, so its negation C3 is false. (This conclusion is robust: even under a stricter reading of ""eventually"" that required a future occurrence, event2 still did happen already, so C2 remains true and C3 false.)

Therefore C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 has already occurred, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true; thus C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true; C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is false."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial (current) state, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After any state in which event1 happens, the next state must have event2.
- After any state in which event2 happens, the next state must have event1.
So the system forces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e. in the considered state at least one of the two events occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. in the considered state neither event1 nor event2 occurs.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the next state neither event1 nor event2 occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is C3?
- From the initial state: state0 has event1, so C1 is true in state0 and C2 is false in state0.
- By the transition rule, state1 (the next state) must have event2, so C1 is true in state1 and C2 is false in state1.
- Therefore C2 does not hold in the next state, so C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Thus, given the initial condition and the mandatory alternation, C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is True (given the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at least once, at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at some later point event2 will occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so after any event2 there is an event1).
From the initial event1 and these rules the two events will both occur (indeed they alternate).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" This is a global existence claim: both events occur somewhere in the timeline.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" That is, whenever event2 occurs, the statement C1 (both events occur) is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Interpreted as C2 is true (globally/at all times) in the described system.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the initial event1 and the transition rules, event2 will occur, and because event2 forces event1 again, both events occur at least once. Thus C1 is true.
- If C1 is true (a global fact about the timeline), then the implication ""if event2 happens then C1"" is true (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent). So C2 is true.
- Since C2 is true in the system, the statement ""C2 always holds"" is true. Therefore C3 is True.

Note/caveat: This conclusion assumes the straightforward interpretation that C1 is a global existence statement (both events occur somewhere in the same timeline) and ""always"" means the claim holds in the given scenario. If you instead mean C1/C2 to be time-local (e.g., C1 must hold at the same instant event2 happens), or you quantify over other possible timelines, the answer could change — clarify the temporal/logical semantics if you want a different formalization.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal/final.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 obliges event1 to occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Interpreted propositionally, this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" (The repetition is redundant.)
- C2: identical to C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 both mean ""event1 happens,"" C3 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""

(If one instead reads C1/C2 as requiring two separate occurrences of event1, that reading is inconsistent with the rule “after event1 no other events can happen,” because a second occurrence would be prevented. But absent a temporal multiplicity interpretation, treat the repetition as propositional redundancy.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final conclusion
- Because event2 happened initially and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is absolute, event1 will occur.
- Therefore C1 holds (so does C2), and hence C3 (C1 or C2) holds.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 has occurred (call that state 0).

2) Transition rules:
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after any state with event2 is one with event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after any state with event1 is one with event2).
- Hence the only possible infinite trace is alternating: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, … (2,1,2,1,…).

3) What each condition means
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted as globally/eventually at every time point event1 holds (i.e., G event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — X C1: at the current state, in the immediately following state C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — G C2: in every state, C2 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- C1 is false on the trace because many states (e.g., state0, state2, ...) have event2, not event1. So G event1 does not hold.
- C2 is false at any state: e.g., at state0 the next state is state1, but from state1 onward event1 does not hold at every future state (state2 is event2), so C1 is not true at the next state — thus X C1 is false. The same reasoning applies at every state.
- Since C2 is not true in (indeed any) states, C3 = G C2 is also false.

Counterexample trace: 2,1,2,1,... shows C1 false, hence C2 false, hence C3 false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has just happened (so event2 does not hold in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- So the system forces an alternating sequence: event1 (initial) → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e. ¬event2 (holds or not in a given state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. globally G(¬event2): in every state, event2 never occurs.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X G(¬event2): from the next state onward, event2 never occurs.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At the initial state: C1 is true (event2 is not happening right now).
- But by the transition rule, the next state must have event2, so ¬event2 is false in the next state.
- Therefore G(¬event2) is false in the next state (because it fails immediately there), so C2 is false in the next state.
- Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start in a state where event2 is already true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: nothing can occur later).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs at some time, then eventually event2 must occur afterwards).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — logically equivalent to C1 (since C1 and C2 are identical). So C3 means ""event1 happens and event2 happens.""

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 already holds initially and no events can happen after event2, there can be no event1 occurring in the time after the initial state. Under the usual interpretation that we consider events from the initial state forward, event1 cannot happen at all, so ""event1 and event2"" is false.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, and C3 (C1 or C2) is false.

Important note on an alternative reading:
- If you allow events before the initial snapshot, it is possible event1 occurred before the initial event2. In that case both event1 and event2 would have happened (event1 then event2), making C1/C2/C3 true.  
- Under the standard forward-from-initial-state reading used above, C3 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it holds at the initial moment).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur after event2).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, it forces event2 afterwards).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Interpreted straightforwardly, C1 asserts that event2 does not occur.
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds.” This asserts both that event2 occurs and that event2 does not occur — a direct contradiction.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” This asserts that the contradictory statement C2 is true at all times.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- The initial condition says event2 happened, so C1 (“event2 does not happen”) is false.
- Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (event2 happens AND C1) is false (it actually is a logical contradiction).
- Since C2 is false (already false at the start), C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false.

C3 is False.

- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, that implies event2 occurs afterward.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs, it is terminal — no event1 or anything else can occur after it.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (the execution starts in a state where event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 happens, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state and no other events can occur after that.

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (i.e., at some point in the execution/event trace, event1 occurs)
- C2: “Event1 eventually happens.” (the same statement as C1)
- C3: “C1 holds or C2 holds” — the disjunction of the two (here redundant, since C1 and C2 are the same).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- Because event2 has already happened and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen now or later. Thus C1 is false and C2 is false.
- C3 = C1 OR C2 is true exactly when at least one of them is true. Since both are false, C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time t0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs after the occurrence of event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e. at t1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at t1 the proposition C1 is true, which means event1 happens at t2. Equivalently C2 = event1 at t2.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at t1 C2 is true, so event1 would hold at t3. Equivalently C3 = event1 at t3.

(You can view these as successive applications of the ""next"" operator: C1 = X event1, C2 = X^2 event1, C3 = X^3 event1.)

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Timeline forced by rules:
  t0: event1 (given)
  t1: event2 (must follow event1)
  t2 and onward: no events (because event2 is terminal)
- Therefore event1 occurs only at t0 and does not occur at t1, t2, t3, ...
- So C1 (event1 at t1) is false; C2 (event1 at t2) is false; C3 (event1 at t3) is false.

Hence C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is False (given the usual interpretation below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially (at the start) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- Consequence: once either event occurs, the system cannot produce any further events.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (Both have occurred at some points in the execution.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (At some time in the future there is a state in which both event1 and event2 have happened.)
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" (Whenever event1 occurs, it guarantees that eventually both event1 and event2 will have happened.)

4) How they relate (reasoning)
- Since event1 already happened initially and event1 is terminal (no other events can happen after it), event2 cannot happen after that point.
- Therefore there is no execution in which both event1 and event2 have happened. So C1 is false.
- Because C1 never becomes true, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
- C3 is the implication (event1 happens) ⇒ (C2 holds). The antecedent is true (event1 did happen initially) but the consequent C2 is false, so the implication is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False under the given assumptions. (If you allow simultaneous occurrence of both events at exactly the same instant, conclusions change: if both occurred simultaneously initially then C1 and C2 would be true and C3 true. The above answer assumes events are ordered in time and ""after"" rules prevent any further events.)

- Events: event1 and event2.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
  Given event2 happened initially and event2 prevents any later events, event1 cannot occur afterward. So under the given scenario C1 is true (event1 does not happen).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
  Since event2 does happen (given), C2 is true regardless of C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e. C2 is false).

4) How they relate / conclusion
- Because event2 happens, C2 is true. Therefore C3 (the negation of C2) is false.
- Even if you were uncertain about C1, the fact that event2 happens alone makes C2 true, so C3 is still false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (i.e., at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. This says if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward. Given Rule A and the initial condition, event2 cannot occur (because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after it), so Rule B is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" (A or A ≡ A.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This is ""Event1 happens AND (Event1 happens)"" which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- From the initial condition, event1 happens. Therefore:
  - C1 is true.
  - C2 is true (since it requires event1 and C1, both true).
  - C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is True — under the intended reading of the rules (where “must happen” means “will happen sometime after”), C2 is always satisfied.

Step‑by‑step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so the next event after event2 is event1).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so the next event after event1 is event2).
Thus the system enforces an alternation: event2 at t0, then event1, then event2, then event1, … (inductively).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event2 happens.” (At an event time this simply says one of the two occurs.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” Logically this is equivalent to (event1 or event2) ⇒ event2, which reduces to event1 ⇒ event2 (since event2 ⇒ event2 is trivial).
- C3: “C2 always holds” — i.e., at every relevant point in time the implication in C2 is true.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- At any event occurrence: if C1 holds because event2 just occurred, then event2 indeed happens (immediately) so C2 holds there. If C1 holds because event1 just occurred, the transition rule “after event1, event2 must happen” guarantees that event2 will occur next (i.e., event1 ⇒ eventual event2), so C2 also holds in that case.
- Therefore, given the transition rules, the implication in C2 is always satisfied at every event step. Hence C3 is True.

Note on interpretation: this conclusion assumes the natural temporal interpretation that “happens” / “must happen” means “occurs (possibly after some time) in the future.” If instead the hypothesis required event2 to occur simultaneously whenever event1 occurs, the answer could change; but under the usual “after … must happen” reading, C3 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the system/trace starts with event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 will occur subsequently.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted in this context: event1 occurs in the execution(s) under consideration. (If you mean a stronger universal claim across all conceivable runs, we only know about the given run where event2 happened.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This is a logical disjunction: C2 is true if either event1 happens, or C1 is true (or both).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is the implication: event2 ⇒ C2.

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From Rule A and the initial condition (event2 happened), event1 will occur in this run. So ""event1 happens"" is true here.
- Given that, C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true (because the left disjunct, event1 happens, is true).
- Since event2 did happen and the consequent C2 is true, the implication in C3 is true for this run. More generally, because Rule A enforces that whenever event2 happens event1 will follow, C2 will always be satisfied whenever event2 happens; therefore C3 holds.

- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After any state where event1 happened, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After any state where event2 happened, no other events can happen in the next state (i.e., the state after event2 is event-less / terminal).

From those rules the only possible prefix of the run starting at state0 is:
- state0: event1
- state1: event2 (required by the first rule)
- state2: no events (required by the second rule)
- no further events after state2

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” At a given state s, C1 means event1 holds in the immediately following state (s+1).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” At a state s, C2 means: at state s+1, C1 is true — equivalently, event1 holds in state s+2.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” C3 means at every state (including the initial one) C2 is true — i.e., at every state s, event1 holds in s+2.

4) Relation and evaluation
Evaluate at the initial state (state0):
- C1 at state0 asks whether event1 holds in state1. But state1 contains event2, not event1, so C1 is false at state0.
- C2 at state0 asks whether event1 holds in state2. State2 contains no events, so C2 is false at state0.
- C3 requires C2 to be true at every state. Since C2 is already false at state0, C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False. (Under the usual linear “next” semantics and the given transition rules there is no way for C1/C2/C3 to be true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., at some later time following any event1, an event2 will happen).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e., at some later time following any event2, an event1 will happen).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true because event1 has already happened initially (and, by the rules, will continue to reoccur).
  - Note: even if “eventually” were taken to mean strictly in the future (excluding the initial moment), the rules force event1 to occur again after event2, so C1 would still be satisfied.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is a disjunction. Since C1 is true, C2 is true no matter whether event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Because C2 is true, C3 is true exactly when event2 happens. So C3 reduces to ""event2 happens.""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value of C3
- From the initial event1 and Rule A, event2 must happen sometime after that initial event1. Therefore event2 does happen.
- Given event2 happens and C2 is already true, C3 = (C2 ∧ event2) is true.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (the state after event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state after event2 would also be terminal).
Because event1 occurred initially, the system is already in a terminal situation and no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Evaluated at the initial state this is true because event1 already happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is: in the immediate successor state, does it remain true that event1 will eventually happen from that state onward?
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" The negation of C2.

4) How do these conditions relate?
- From the initial state C1 is true (event1 already happened).
- But there are no further events after event1, so in the next state's future event1 will not occur (and if there is no successor at all, most standard semantics make the next-state formula false). Therefore C1 is not true when evaluated in the next state — C2 is false.
- Since C2 is false, C3 (which asserts ""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Note on semantics: if you used an unusual convention where the terminal state ""stutters"" or records that event1 has happened so that ""event1 eventually happens"" remains true in successors, the answer could differ. Under the standard interpretation used above (events are instantaneous and do not reoccur after the terminal point, or Xφ is false if there is no successor), C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event1 happens.

2) Transition rules
- From any state where event1 happens, the next state must have event2.
- After a state where event2 happens, no other events can happen in subsequent states (i.e. all later states have no events / event1 and event2 are false).

A canonical trace consistent with this is:
- s0: event1 true
- s1: event2 true (forced by s0)
- s2, s3, ...: no events true

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted as: in every state from the current one onward, event1 is true (temporal G event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at the next state, it is true that event1 holds in all states from that next state onward (X G event1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state at which C2 is true (F (X G event1)).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- C1 is false in s0 because although event1 holds in s0, it does not hold in s1 and later — so G event1 is false everywhere on the trace.
- Therefore C2 (which asserts G event1 starting at the next state) is false at every state (there is no state from which event1 holds forever).
- Hence C3, which requires that C2 be true at some future state, is also false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 holds in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., the next state after a state with event1 must have event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., the next state after a state with event2 must have event1).
These two rules force strict alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e. at time t+1).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — taken naturally as (event1 at t+1) AND (event1 at t).
  Note: the second conjunct is satisfied at the initial state because event1 holds initially.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 must be true in every state.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From alternation and the initial event1 at t (event1 at t), the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 at t+1. Therefore C1 (event1 at t+1) is false.
- If C1 is false, C2 (C1 AND event1 now) is false.
- If C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

(If you interpreted ""after"" as “eventually after” instead of “immediately next,” the same conclusion holds: event1 at the next state is not guaranteed, so C1 is not forced and C3 fails.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (i.e. at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so there is a later time where event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the run ends after event2).

A possible finite trace consistent with the context: time t0: event1; time t1: event2; then stop.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just a redundant statement; it simplifies to: event1 happens (i.e. C1 ≡ event1).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 ≡ event1, C2 simplifies to event1 as well (C2 ≡ event1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that C2 (i.e. event1) is true at all times.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and is C3 true?
- Both C1 and C2 reduce to the single proposition ""event1 happens.""
- C3 claims that ""event1 happens"" is true at every time.
- In the intended reading where ""happens"" means ""occurs at that time"" (an instantaneous event), event1 occurs only at the initial time t0 and does not occur at the later time t1. Thus C2 is true at t0 but false at t1, so C3 (""always C2"") is false.

Note on ambiguity: If instead ""event1 happens"" is intended to mean ""event1 has happened at some point in the past (is true globally once it has occurred)"", then C2 would remain true at all later times and C3 would be true. Under the usual instantaneous-event reading, however, C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Interpreting ""happens"" as instantaneous, event1 occurs only at the initial time and not at later times (when event2 occurs). C2 reduces to ""event1 holds,"" which is not true at all times, so ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false."

Short answer: C3 is True under the usual reading that events are instantaneous occurrences. Below I show the step‑by‑step reasoning and note the one alternative interpretation.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the initial step (the trace starts with event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e. the system reaches a terminal state once event1 has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also lead to a terminal state).
Given the initial condition (event1 at time 0) and the rule after event1, no further events occur in this execution.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
(I give them a standard temporal-logic reading; other readings are possible — see note below.)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as G(event1): at every time from now on, event1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted as F(C1) = F(G(event1)): there is some future time from which event1 holds at every time thereafter.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Interpreted as ¬F(G(event1)).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- At time 0 event1 is true, but at the next time step there are no events (so event1 is not true there). Therefore G(event1) is false (C1 is false).
- Because there is no future point from which event1 holds forever (event1 only occurred at time 0), F(G(event1)) is false (C2 is false).
- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold; since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Conclusion (standard instantaneous-event semantics): C3 is True.

Note (alternative semantics): If you instead interpret ""event1 happened"" as a persistent fact (a proposition that becomes true once and stays true forever), then G(event1) would be true from the initial point onward, so C1 true, C2 true, and C3 false. Make sure which semantics you intend: instantaneous occurrences (first analysis) or a permanent flag set by the occurrence (alternative).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: under the usual instantaneous-event reading, event1 occurs at time 0 only, so G(event1) is false, hence F(G(event1)) is false, and ¬F(G(event1)) (C3) is true. (If instead ""event1 happened"" were a persistent fact, C3 would be false.)"

Short answer: C3 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (in the initial state) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: “After event1, event2 must happen.” (If event1 occurs then event2 must occur afterward.)
- Rule B: “After event2, no other events can happen.” So any state where event2 occurs is terminal — there is no successor state with further events.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” Interpreted at a single state, this is the implication (event2 → event2) in that state — a tautology (true whenever we evaluate it in a state where event2 is true, and true vacuously if event2 is false).
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” It claims that C1 is false in the (current) state.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” It asserts that in the successor state (the next state) C2 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- In the initial state event2 is true. So C1 (event2 → event2) is true there. Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) is false in the initial state.
- By rule B, the state where event2 happened is terminal: there is no next state. Under the usual “next” semantics (Next φ is false if there is no successor state), C3 (“C2 holds in the next state”) is false because there is no next state in which C2 could hold.

Therefore C3 is false. (If you use a different semantic convention for “next” when no successor exists, let me know and we can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C3 is False (because C2 does hold under the usual reading). Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 → event1.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal.)

Therefore the only possible (finite) sequence consistent with the rules is: event2 (already happened) → event1 → stop.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — read as the material implication: if event1 happens then event2 happens (i.e. whenever event1 holds, event2 holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. it is false that (if event1 then event2).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the rules, event1 does happen (because event2 happened and after event2 event1 must happen), so C1 is True.
- Event2 has happened (initially). Thus the implication ""if event1 then event2"" is True in the standard/material sense: the consequent (event2) is true, so the implication holds.
- Therefore C2 is True, so the negation C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is False.

Note on interpretation: If C2 were intended to mean ""whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterwards (i.e. after event1)"", then C2 would be False because no events can occur after event1. Under that temporal reading C3 would be True. The conclusion above assumes the usual (atemporal/material) reading of the implication.

- C3: C1 or C2 — logically equivalent to “event1 eventually happens” (since C1 and C2 are the same).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event2 has already happened and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur after the initial point. That means event1 cannot happen at any later time.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, and C3 (their disjunction) is false.

Caveat: If one allowed event1 to have happened before the given initial point, or if “eventually” were interpreted non-standardly to include the past, the answer could differ. Under the usual forward-time interpretation from the stated initial condition, C3 is False.

Stepwise answers:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at least once).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → event1)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)
Together these mean event1 and event2 imply each other (event1 ↔ event2), so once one occurs the other must occur (possibly at a later time).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (C1 = event2 ∧ event1)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (C2 = (event2 ∧ event1) → event2)
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" (C3 = C2 ∧ event2)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event1 and the rule event1 → event2, event2 does happen. So both event1 and event2 occur, hence C1 is true.
- C2 is a logically true implication (if event2 ∧ event1 then event2); it is tautologically true because C1 already asserts event2. So C2 holds.
- C3 is the conjunction of C2 (true) and event2 (true), so C3 is true.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 happens, then event1 happens.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 happens, then event2 happens.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches Rule B, so C1 is true given the context.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" As written C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" This is the logical disjunction of C1 and C2: it is true if at least one of C1 or C2 is true.

4) How they relate and final answer
- From the rules we have event1 ⇒ event2 and event2 ⇒ event1. In particular event1 ⇒ event2 holds, so C1 is true. C2 is the same statement, so it is true as well.
- Therefore C3 (C1 or C2) is True (a disjunction of true propositions is true).

(If C2 was intended to mean the other rule, ""if event2 then event1,"" then both conditionals still hold from the context, so C3 would still be True.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after the initial state contains event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the trace ends after event2).

So the only allowed sequence is: state0: event1 → state1: event2 → (no further events).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., NOT C1).
- C3: “Event2 happens OR C2 holds” (i.e., C1 OR NOT C1).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- From the transition rules, C1 is true (event2 must occur in the next state).
- Therefore C2 is false.
- C3 = C1 OR NOT C1 is true by the law of excluded middle (and in this scenario because C1 is true).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1 at some later time).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just the conjunction of the same proposition with itself.
- C2: identical to C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — i.e. (C1) OR (C2). Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is logically equivalent to that statement; in simpler terms C3 says “event1 happens” (under ordinary propositional interpretation).

4) How they relate and the truth value of C3
- From the initial condition and Rule A, event1 must occur (because event2 occurred).
- Rule B does not prevent event1 from occurring once; it only forbids any further events after event1.
- Therefore the proposition ""event1 happens"" is true. Hence C1 is true (the conjunction of a true proposition with itself is true), C2 is true, and so C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

Note on an alternative reading: if C1/C2 were intended to require two distinct occurrences of event1 (i.e., “event1 occurs twice”), then Rule B (no events can happen after event1) would prevent a second occurrence, so C1 and C2 would be false and C3 would be false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (so at time 0 event2 occurs).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — once it has happened, the system produces no further events).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs at some time, then event2 must occur afterwards).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as the claim that event1 occurs in the execution (or in every execution). (Either way, it asserts that event1 does occur.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that the statement C1 is true (in the system / in every reachable run).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Conjunction: event1 occurs AND C2 is true.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because event2 has already happened initially and rule A forbids any events after event2, no occurrence of event1 can happen at any later time. There is no earlier time before the initial state in which event1 could have occurred, so event1 never occurs in the execution.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not happen).
- If C1 is false, then C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.
- C3 requires both event1 to happen and C2 to hold; since both conjuncts are false, C3 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False (and C1 and C2 are false under the given assumptions).

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initial state) event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs at some time t, then event1 must occur afterwards — minimally at the next state.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (If event1 occurs at time t, then at any later time no events can occur.)

I will take “happens” to mean “occurs in that state/time step.”

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens” — redundant form; effectively asserts “event2 happens (in the given state).”
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds” — i.e., in the same state both event1 and event2 occur.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — in the next time step both event1 and event2 occur.

4) How do these relate and what follows?
- The initial state has event1 at time 0.
- By Rule B, once event1 has occurred (at time 0), no events can occur at any later time. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any future state (including the next state).
- Thus in the next state, C1 is false (event2 does not happen), so C2 is false (it requires both event1 and event2), and therefore C3 (that C2 holds in the next state) is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

- Events: event1 and event2.

2) Transition rules (given):
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — event2 would also be terminal, but this is irrelevant because event1 already occurred first.

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual reading that only event2 happened initially and events are not simultaneous). Step‑by‑step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened.
- Also given: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So either event occurring makes the system terminal (no further events).

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs at some time, that state is terminal (no later events).
- If event2 occurs at some time, that state is terminal.
- Since event2 has already happened initially, there are no possible later events in this run.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunction; C1 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 is the same as ""Event1 happens"", C2 ≡ ""Event1 happens"" as well.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ ""event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some point now or in the future event1 occurs).

4) How they relate and the conclusion
- Because the run starts with event2 and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not happen now or in the future in this run.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, and C3 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.

Note on an alternative interpretation: if you allowed event1 and event2 to occur simultaneously at the initial moment, then event1 would have happened and C3 would be true. But under the usual sequential reading given (“Initially, event2 happened” and each event blocks any further events), C3 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- There are two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, no further events (including event1) can occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this in the natural way here: in every possible execution/run of the system event2 occurs. Given the fixed initial condition that event2 happened, that is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This is the conjunction (C2 ∧ event2).

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition, C1 is true (event2 occurs in the only possible run).
- Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is false.
- C3 requires C2 to be true and event2 to happen. Even though event2 happens, C2 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Answer: C3 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (the initial state is a state “after event2”).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (the system is stuck/terminal after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal if it ever occurs).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (There is some future point at/after the initial state when event1 has occurred.)
- C2: same as C1 (the statement given repeats the same claim).
- C3: C1 or C2 — the disjunction that event1 eventually happens (since both C1 and C2 say the same thing, C3 is just “event1 eventually happens”).

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- Because the initial state is already after event2 and after event2 no further events can occur, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur after the initial state.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, and their disjunction C3 is false.

(Only caveat: if one allowed event1 to have happened before the “initial” description or to have happened simultaneously with event2, the answer could differ. Under the usual reading that the initial state is “after event2” and event1 has not occurred, the conclusion above holds.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true). Whether event1 happens is not asserted/unknown.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen"" mean each event, if it occurs, is terminal (no further events follow). These rules don't change the fact that event2 has already happened.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens (C1 = event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: if event1 happens then C1 holds (C2 = event1 → C1).
- C3: C2 does not hold (C3 = ¬C2).

4) How they relate and truth values
- event2 is true (given), so C1 = event1 ∨ event2 is true.
- An implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent, so C2 = (event1 → C1) is true because C1 is true.
- Therefore C3 = ¬C2 is false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (so event1 = True at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) may occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs, then event1 must also occur (at some point after/because of event2). (This rule is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: event1 happens OR event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds OR event1 happens. (Logically redundant — since C1 already contains event1, C2 is effectively the same as C1 or just event1.)
- C3: C2 holds AND event2 happens.

4) Relation and truth evaluation
- From (1) and (2): event1 = True, and because event1 occurred and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur. So event2 = False.
- Evaluate C1: True OR False = True.
- Evaluate C2: C1 OR event1 = True OR True = True.
- Evaluate C3: C2 AND event2 = True AND False = False.

Therefore C3 is False.

(Note: this assumes standard temporal interpretation of ""after."" If you allow event2 to have happened before the initial event1, the situation would change; under the given “initially event1 happened” reading, event2 does not occur.)

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (it is true in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal: if event2 occurs, no further events occur afterwards.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal as well.
- Because event1 already happened initially and it is terminal, no other events (including event2) can occur after that.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This says that at some point (now or later) the statement C1 is true. Since C1 is already true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2.

4) How they relate
- C1 is true (event1 happened).
- Therefore C2 is true (C1 holds now, so it eventually holds).
- Therefore C3, which asserts C2 is false, is itself false.

Conclusion: C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reasoning:
- From the context: event2 occurs initially, then event1 must occur (so event1 will occur at least once), and after event1 nothing else can happen.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false if read as the usual temporal ""always"" (must hold at every time point) because at the initial moment event1 has not yet happened. You only get that event1 will eventually happen, not that it is always true.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens) is false, and therefore C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is also false — C2 cannot become true later (it already fails at the initial point and cannot be retroactively made true)."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0), event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This can be read as either: event1 must happen immediately in the next state, or at some later point — either way it forces event1 to occur after an occurrence of event2.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. in state s1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. in every state, the next state has event2; globally G C1).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e. at s1, C2 is true; X C2).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- C1 is not guaranteed by the premises. From the premises we only know event2 happened at s0 and that event1 must happen after event2. If “after” means immediate, then s1 must be event1, so C1 is false at s0. If “after” means eventually, s1 might be event2 or might be event1 — either is allowed — so C1 is not guaranteed (it can be true in some traces and false in others). Thus C1 is not a logical consequence of the context.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is strictly stronger and even less likely; there is no basis to conclude that event2 occurs in every next state forever. So C2 is false (not entailed).
- C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state. Since C2 is false, C3 is false as well.

Concrete counterexample trace (immediate interpretation): s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: no events. Here C1 is false at s0, so C2 and C3 are false.

Concrete counterexample trace (eventual interpretation): s0: event2, s1: event1, ... also shows C1 can be false; or s0: event2, s1: event2, s2: event1 shows C1 true at s0 but C2 still fails globally. In all readings, you cannot conclude C2, hence C3 is false.

Therefore C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start in a state after event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state after event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs it is followed by event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This asserts that in the immediate next state event2 occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" A material implication: if (event2 happens next) then (event1 happens).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" At some point (possibly now) the formula C2 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because we start in a state after event2 and no events can happen thereafter, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false at the current (initial) state.
- A material implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true at the current state (vacuously true).
- C3 asks whether C2 holds at some time in the future; since C2 already holds now, C3 is true.

Therefore C3 is True. (If you intended a nonstandard reading of ""if ... then ..."" or of ""eventually,"" say so and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

Answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at least once).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So the events force an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... . In particular, event1 does happen (initially and again after any event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just a tautology collapsed to ""Event1 happens"" (A ∨ A ≡ A).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 ≡ ""Event1 happens"", C2 ≡ ""Event1 happens or Event1 happens"" ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 ≡ ¬(Event1 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C3?
- From the initial condition and the transition rules, ""Event1 happens"" is true (it happened initially, and the cycle ensures it recurs).
- Therefore C1 is true, C2 is true, and C3, being the negation of C2, is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at least once).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur.
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur.
- With the given initial event1, this enforces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (so event2 does occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (read as a proposition saying event1 does not occur.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (C2 = C1 ∧ event2)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" (C3 = C2 ∨ event2)

Step 4 — relation and evaluation
- Because the initial event1 occurred, C1 is false (it contradicts the initial condition).
- Therefore C2 = C1 ∧ event2 is false (false ∧ anything = false).
- Logically, C3 = C2 ∨ event2. By absorption, (C1 ∧ event2) ∨ event2 simplifies to event2, so C3 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- From the transition rules and the initial event1, event2 must happen. Thus event2 is true, hence C3 is true.

Answer: C3 is True.

(If you meant different time-scoping for ""does not happen"" — e.g., ""does not happen at some specific later time"" — clarify that and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred at the start.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. event2 ⇒ later event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (i.e. once event1 has happened, the execution is stuck — no event2 can ever happen afterwards).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — formally: at the current point in time, there exists a future point where event2 occurs (F event2).
- C2: “C1 always holds” — formally: at every point in time, C1 holds (G F event2). In other words, from every state along the execution, event2 will eventually happen.
- C3: “C2 always holds” — formally: at every point in time, C2 holds (G G F event2). This is stronger than C2 (but logically if C2 is false then so is C3).

4) How they relate and final answer
- Because the initial state already has event1, rule B prevents any further events ever happening. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any future point. So C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false in the actual initial execution.
- Since C1 is false now, C2 (that C1 holds at every time) is also false. Consequently C3 is false as well.

Short conclusion: C3 is False. A concrete witness/execution: start with event1 and stop (no more events). That execution satisfies the rules but falsifies C1, C2 and C3.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already occurred and Rule B forbids any further events, so event2 can never occur. Hence C1 (F event2) is false now, so C2 (G F event2) is false, and therefore C3 (G G F event2) is false."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Also: after event2 no other events can happen; after event1 no other events can happen.
From this we conclude event1 did not happen (because event2 already happened initially and that prevents any further events).

2) Transition rules
- Both ""after event2 no other events can happen"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" mean each event is terminal: once it has occurred, no further events occur.

3) What the conditions mean (logical form)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Logically: event1 → event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Logically: (event1 → event2) ∨ event1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Logically: ¬[(event1 → event2) ∨ event1].

4) How they relate / truth evaluation
- We determined event1 is false (it did not happen).
- In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true, so event1 → event2 is true (vacuously).
- Therefore C2 = true ∨ false = true.
- Hence C3 = ¬C2 = false.

Note: this uses the standard (material) implication interpretation. Under that reading, C3 is definitely False.

Answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some point after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (execution ends/terminal after event1).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Read naturally here as ""event1 does occur in the execution (it will happen after event2)."" Under that reading C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" If interpreted as “the fact that event1 occurs is true in the execution,” this is the same as C1 and is true. (If instead you interpret C1 as a global temporal formula and C2 as a nested global — a stronger LTL-style reading — C2 could be false; see note below.)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" This is a disjunction: either C2 is true or event1 happens.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event2 happened initially and the rule forces event1 after event2, event1 does happen in the run.
- Therefore the right disjunct of C3 (""event1 happens"") is true, so C3 is true regardless of the truth of C2.

Note on alternate formal readings: if you use a temporal logic reading where C1 = F(event1) (eventually event1) and C2 = G(C1) (C1 holds at every time, i.e. G F event1 which means infinitely often event1), then C1 is true, C2 is false (event1 happens only once), but C3 = C2 or event1 still evaluates to true because event1 happens.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurs and the rule forces event1 to occur afterward, so the disjunction C3 (C2 or event1) is true because the right disjunct (event1) holds."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (call that time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, the system has no further events at later times).
- Rule B: If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards (i.e., event2 → eventually event1). (This constraint does not force event2 to occur; it just requires that if it does, event1 must later occur.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” This is a proposition about the run: both events occur (not necessarily simultaneously).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” In temporal logic notation: F(C1) — at some future time C1 becomes true.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” In temporal logic: G(F(C1)) — at every time, it is guaranteed that eventually C1 will hold (i.e., C1 will keep occurring infinitely often or will still happen at some future point from any current time).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final evaluation)?
- Because event1 already happened initially (time 0) and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no further events can occur at any later time. In particular, event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 and event1 happen"") is false (event1 did happen, but event2 does not and cannot happen).
- Hence C2 (there will eventually be a time when C1 holds) is false.
- Hence C3 (always in the future C2 holds) is also false.

(As a side note: Rule B is satisfied vacuously because event2 never occurs, but that does not make C1, C2, or C3 true.)

Conclusion: C3 is False.

Short answer: C3 is False under the given context.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If E2 happens, then afterwards E1 must happen (E2 ⇒ eventually E1).
- Rule B: After E1 happens, no other events can happen (E1 is terminal — no events strictly after E1).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: E1 and E2 both happen (E1 ∧ E2).
- C2: C1 holds or E2 happens: (E1 ∧ E2) ∨ E2. This simplifies to E2 (because (E1 ∧ E2) ∨ E2 ≡ E2).
- C3: C2 holds and E2 happens: C2 ∧ E2. Since C2 ≡ E2, C3 ≡ E2 ∧ E2 ≡ E2. So logically C3 is equivalent to “event2 happens.”

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- We know E1 is true initially and rule B says no events can occur after E1. That prevents E2 from occurring after the initial E1. (Unless you allow E2 to have occurred strictly before the initial moment or exactly simultaneously — see caveat below.)
- Therefore, under the usual reading (no prior or simultaneous E2), E2 is false, so C3 (which is equivalent to E2) is false.

Caveat: If one allowed E2 to have happened before the “initial” moment or exactly at the same time as E1, then C3 would be true iff E2 actually occurred. But with the usual temporal reading given (E1 initially and E1 blocks any later events), C3 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C3 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". Given event1 has already happened and after event1 no events can occur, event2 cannot occur afterward, so event2 is false and therefore C3 is false (unless you allow event2 to have occurred before or exactly at the initial moment)."

Short answer: C3 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. every continuation from the state after event2 includes event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What do C1, C2, C3 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. in all possible executions given the context, event1 occurs).
- C2: same as C1 (they are identical statements).
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" (logical OR of the two).

4) How do they relate?
- Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", every allowed execution contains event1. Thus C1 is true. C2 is the same, so it is also true. Therefore C3 = (C1 or C2) is true (indeed true OR true = true).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (they alternate).

From the initial event2 we therefore get an execution that includes event1 next (and then event2, then event1, …).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens"" (A or A ≡ A).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ""not(Event1 does not happen)"" = ""Event1 happens."" (double negation)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the context, event1 does happen (it must happen after the initial event2). So C1 is True.
- Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is False.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is True (and in fact C3 ≡ C1).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — equivalently, both C1 and C2 are true.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal, no other events can occur after it; in particular, event1 cannot occur after event2.
- Therefore the conjunction ""event2 and event1"" (C1 and C2) is false under the usual temporal reading.
- If C1 is false and C2 is false, then C3 (C1 and C2) is also false.

Conclusion
- C3 is False.

Note: only if you allow both events to occur simultaneously at the initial moment (so neither occurs after the other) could C1/C2/C3 be true. Under the standard sequential interpretation given, they are false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the state where event2 has occurred is terminal — there are no transitions out of it).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur later).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there exists some future state in which event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (the next state satisfies C1; in temporal logic notation: X C1).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" (C2 ∧ event1).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 already happened initially and that state is terminal (no further events/steps), there are no future states in which any new events can occur. Therefore event1 cannot occur in any future state. So C1 is false.
- There is no next state (or, if one uses standard ""next"" semantics, X φ is false when there is no successor), so C2 is false.
- C3 requires C2 to be true and also event1 to happen; both fail here. Therefore C3 is false.

Notes on assumptions: This answer assumes the usual forward (""after"" = in the future) reading of the rules and standard next-state semantics (no successor ⇒ X φ is false). If you intended a different temporal reading (e.g., ""after"" allows referring to past occurrences, or a weak-next operator that treats lack of successor differently), the truth values could change; tell me the intended semantics if you want the analysis under those alternatives.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 has already occurred and that state is terminal, so there is no next state and event1 cannot eventually occur; therefore C1 and C2 are false, hence C3 (C2 ∧ event1) is false."

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
=> Once either event1 or event2 has occurred, the system moves to a state where no further events can occur.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" — a proposition that both events have occurred (in the same state or as true facts about that state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the state immediately after the current one, both events have occurred.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — in the state two steps ahead, C1 holds.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition we know event2 happened at the initial state. Nothing says event1 happened there. Because event2 is terminal, no other events (including event1) can happen later.
- Therefore C1 is false in the initial state (event1 does not occur now and cannot occur later).
- If C1 is false now, then C2 (which requires C1 to hold in the next state) is false, and thus C3 (requiring C2 in the next-next state) is also false.

(If one allowed an exotic interpretation where both events occurred simultaneously at the initial moment, C1 could be true at the initial state — but even then, because event2 is terminal, the next state contains no events, so C2 and hence C3 would still be false.)

Short answer: C3 is False (under the usual reading that only event2 happened initially and both events are terminal).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Nothing says event1 happened initially, so take event1 as not having happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal: if event2 happens at some time, no further events occur afterwards.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is also terminal.
- With event2 happening initially, terminality of event2 prevents event1 from happening later.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and is always true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Substituting C2, C3 is equivalent to: event2 → event1.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- We know event2 is true (it happened initially).
- We know event1 is false (it did not happen; event2's terminality prevents it).
- C3 is the implication event2 → event1. With antecedent true and consequent false, the implication is false.
- Therefore C3 is False.

Edge note: If you allowed both events to occur simultaneously at the initial moment (so event1 also happened initially), then C3 would be true. But under the usual temporal reading given, C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is true at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has happened the system is terminal; no further events (so event2 cannot occur after event1).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — similarly, if event2 ever happens it would be terminal. (This second rule is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the first rule and the initial condition.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e. E1 ∨ E2.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some time (possibly now) E1 ∨ E2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. it is asserted that C2 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From (1), event1 is true at the initial time, so C1 (E1 ∨ E2) is true now.
- Therefore C2 (""eventually C1"") is true (it already holds immediately).
- C3 asserts that C2 is false, but since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, no future state contains any event).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs then event1 must occur afterward). This rule is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (At the current state, the immediately following state contains event2.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (At some future state, C1 is true — equivalently, there exists a time t such that at t+1 event2 occurs.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (At some future state, C2 becomes true — equivalently, there exists a time t such that from that time there will be some later time where C1 holds.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because the initial state already has event1 and the rule says no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur in any future state. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
  - C2 is false (there is no future state where C1 holds, since event2 never occurs).
  - C3 is false (there is no future state where C2 becomes true).

So C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (i.e. event1 → eventually event2).
- Rule B: If event2 happens, then no other events can happen afterwards (i.e. event2 is terminal / deadlock).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — there exists some future time when event1 occurs (F event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future time at which C1 is true, i.e. F (F event1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — F (F (F event1)).

(Technical note: in standard linear-time temporal logic F is idempotent: F(F φ) ≡ F φ, so C1, C2, C3 are all semantically equivalent to F event1.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other given the rules?
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal (no further events can happen), event1 cannot occur at any future time.
- Therefore F event1 (C1) is false.
- By the idempotence noted above, F(F event1) and F(F(F event1)) are also false. So C2 and C3 are false.

Conclusion: C3 is False. (Same reasoning shows C1 and C2 are also False under the given assumptions.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial condition?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: after event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- Rule B: after event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
Together these force strict alternation: starting from s0 (event2), the states go s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ... (and so on).

3) What each condition means
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At a given state t, C1(t) means event1 holds at the successor state t+1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At state t, C2(t) means C1(t+1) is true — equivalently, event1 holds at t+2.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C3 means for every state t, C2(t) is true (i.e., at every state, event1 will hold two steps ahead).

4) How they relate and truth values
- At s0 (initial): event2 holds.
  - C1(s0)? Is event1 at s1? Yes (by rule B). So C1 is true at s0.
  - C2(s0)? Is event1 at s2? No — s2 is event2 (because s1 is event1 and rule A forces s2 = event2). So C2 is false at s0.
- More generally on the alternating timeline:
  - At states where event2 holds (like s0, s2, ...): C1 is true (next state is event1) but C2 is false (two steps ahead is event2).
  - At states where event1 holds (like s1, s3, ...): C1 is false (next state is event2) but C2 is true (two steps ahead is event1).
Thus C2 is true at event1 states and false at event2 states — it is not true at every state.

Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

False

- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. C2 is true in the actual situation (equivalently ¬E2).

- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur sometime afterward.
- After event2 occurs, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Given the initial condition that event1 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., ¬C1). Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: “Event1 happens and C2 holds” — this is (event1) ∧ (¬C1). That conjunct requires both event1 and that event1 does not eventually happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and final verdict
- Because event1 has happened, C1 is true, so C2 (¬C1) is false. Therefore C3 = event1 ∧ C2 = true ∧ false = false.
- More conceptually, C3 is self-contradictory: it asserts event1 happens while also asserting that “event1 eventually happens” is false. Under the given initial condition, C3 cannot be true.

Answer: C3 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Given event1 has already happened, C1 is true, so C2 (¬C1) is false. C3 requires event1 and C2, i.e. true ∧ false, which is false."

Short answers up front:
- C1 (Event1 does not happen) — True.
- C2 (C1 always holds) — True.
- C3 (C2 does not hold) — False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event2, no other events can happen” — once event2 occurs, the system is terminal: no further events (including event1) can occur.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — likewise, event1 would also be terminal if it ever occurred.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 does not happen (i.e., at no point does event1 occur).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in all times/futures reachable from the initial state, event1 never happens).
- C3: C2 does not hold (i.e., it is not the case that C1 always holds).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because the initial state already has event2 and event2 prevents any further events, event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial moment.
- There is no indication event1 occurred before the initial moment; the natural reading is that only event2 has happened initially. Therefore C1 is true.
- Since event1 cannot occur at any future time (due to event2 being terminal), C1 holds at all times/futures, so C2 is true.
- C3 claims that C2 does not hold; but C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

Caveat: If you allow the unusual reading that event1 had already happened simultaneously with event2 at the initial moment, then C1 would be false and the answers change. Under the usual sequential reading given, C3 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event2 has already happened and prevents any further events, event1 never occurs (C1 true) and therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is true; C3 (= ""C2 does not hold"") is false. (Only if one reads that event1 had already occurred simultaneously with event2 would the conclusion change.)"

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., once event2 has occurred, event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Taken together these force the sequence: event2 (initial) → event1 → nothing else.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — logically this is just ""event1 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ""event1 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. ""it is not the case that event1 does not happen,"" which is equivalent to ""event1 does happen.""

4) How they relate and final truth value
- From the rules, event2 has occurred and therefore event1 must occur. So C1 is true (event1 happens).
- Therefore C2 (""event1 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

Conclusion: C3 is True.

Short answer: C3 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is given as the starting fact).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it happened).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds OR event1 happens"" (C2 = C1 ∨ event1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (C3 = ¬C2).

4) How these conditions relate and result:
- Because event1 already happened and is terminal, no other events can happen after it, so event2 does not happen. Therefore C1 is True.
- event1 is True (given), so C2 = (C1 ∨ event1) = (True ∨ True) = True.
- C3 = ¬C2 = ¬True = False.

Thus C3 is False.

(If you allowed event2 to have occurred before the initial event1, the conclusion could differ; with the given statement ""Initially, event1 happened"" the reasoning above applies.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False"
