- C1 is ""event2 eventually happens."" In this cycle, event2 occurs infinitely often. From any state, event2 either has already occurred or will occur in the immediate future. Thus, C1 is always true.
- C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, whenever event2 happens, C1 is true, so the implication holds. Even when event2 does not happen (e.g., when event1 is true), the implication is vacuously true. Therefore, C2 is always true.

- Initially, event2 happened.

- After event1, no other events can happen.

The sequence of events is deterministic: event2 occurs initially, then event1 occurs, and then the system remains in event1 indefinitely.

- C1 (Event1 eventually happens) is true at all times because event1 occurs at time t=1. At t=0, event1 will happen at t=1, so C1 is true. At t=1 and beyond, event1 has happened, so C1 is true.
- C2 (If event2 happens, then C1 holds) is true at all times:
  - At t=0, event2 happens and C1 is true, so C2 is true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, let's evaluate C3 step by step.

- The context states that initially, event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2, no other events can happen. Thus, the sequence of events is: event1 occurs at time t=0, then event2 occurs at time t=1 and remains true for all subsequent times.
- C1 is defined as ""Event1 happens and event1 happens,"" which is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Therefore, C1 holds only when event1 is true.
- C2 is defined as ""C1 does not hold,"" meaning C2 is true when event1 is false.
- C3 is defined as ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This means that whenever event2 is true, C2 must be true, i.e., event1 must be false.

In the sequence:
- At time t=0, event1 is true, but event2 is not true, so the condition ""if event2 happens"" is not applicable.
- From time t=1 onwards, event2 is true. At these times, event1 is false because the system has moved to event2 and event1 does not occur again. Thus, C2 holds (since event1 is false) whenever event2 is true.

Therefore, C3 is true.

- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

This creates a cyclic sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

Now, evaluate C3:
- For C3 to be true, there must be a state where event1 happens and C2 holds (i.e., C1 does not hold).
- C1 holds if event2 happens in the next state.
- When event1 happens, the next state must have event2 (from the context). Therefore, at any state where event1 happens, C1 is true because event2 happens in the next state.
- Since C1 is true when event1 happens, C2 (which requires C1 to not hold) is false when event1 happens.
- Thus, it is impossible for both event1 to happen and C2 to hold simultaneously. Therefore, C3 can never be true.

In summary, there is no state in the sequence where C3 holds. Hence, C3 is false.

- C1 is defined as ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", which simplifies to ""event2 happens"". Since event2 never happens, C1 is always false.

- Initially, event1 happened, so at the initial state, only event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so the next state will have event2 true.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so event2 remains true indefinitely.
- C1 requires both event1 and event2 to happen simultaneously in the same state. However, in any single state, only one event is true (event1 at t=0, event2 at t=1 and beyond). Therefore, C1 is never true in any state.
- C2 requires that C1 always holds. Since C1 is never true, C2 is always false.
- C3 requires that C2 eventually holds. Since C2 is always false, it never holds, so C3 is false.
