1. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - ""After event1, no other events can happen"" ⇒ event1 is absorbing: any state with event1 must have its next state also be event1.
   - The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs (we start in event1 and cannot leave it).

2. Translate the claims:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e., in a state s, C1 holds iff the successor state s' has event1.
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" = G C1 (C1 holds at every state).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" = G C2 = G G C1 which is equivalent to G C1, so C3 ≡ C2.

3. Evaluate:
   - Since event1 is true initially and event1 states only lead to event1, every state's successor has event1. Therefore C1 holds at every state, so G C1 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context, the only reachable state is the initial state where event2 holds, and it stays there forever (after event2 no other events can happen).  
2. Evaluate C1 in that state: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is event2 -> event1. Here event2 is true and event1 is false, so C1 is false in the state.  
3. Evaluate C2 in that state: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is C1 -> event2. Since C1 is false, the implication is true in the state.  
4. Because the system remains in that same state forever, C2 holds in all states along the trace. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is True."

1. Context: initially event2 happened. After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal). After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal). So the initial state has event2 true and event1 false, and there are no transitions to change that.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens."" That would require event1 to be true in the initial state (and thereafter). But the initial state has event2, not event1, so C1 is false.

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication. Because C1 is false, the implication C1 -> event1 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true). So C2 holds in the initial state.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., G F event2).
   - We must check that from every reachable state, event2 will occur at some future time.

3. C3 is ""C2 always holds."" We must check every state:
   - At the initial state C2 holds (as shown).
   - After event1 we are at an event2 state. After event2 no other events can happen, so all future states remain event2. In any event2 state the next state is also event2, so C1 holds in every event2 state; hence C2 holds in every event2 state as well.
   - Therefore C2 holds at every state along the execution, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

1. Context: Initially event1 holds. The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 holds, the system stays in states where event1 holds (no transition to any other event). Similarly, ""After event2, no other events can happen"" makes event2 terminal, but irrelevant here because event2 never occurs from the initial state.

5. C1 (event1 AND event2) never holds in any single state (event1 and event2 do not hold simultaneously).
6. Therefore C2 (event2 -> C1) is:

1. Context gives a single possible trace: s0 where event1 holds (initial), then s1 where event2 holds (event2 must follow event1), and thereafter s2, s3, ... where event2 continues to hold (after event2 no other events can happen).
2. C1 is ""event1 or event2"". Evaluate C1 along the trace:
   - s0: event1 is true → C1 true.

1. C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 -> event2). That is a logical tautology: it is true in every state (true when event2 holds, and also true when event2 does not hold).

1. System: initially event2. After event2 event1 must happen, after event1 event2 must happen — so states alternate event2, event1, event2, ...; event1 occurs in some states and event2 in others.

2. C1 is the formula (event1 → event1). This is a logical tautology: it is true in every state (if event1 is false the implication is true; if event1 is true then the consequent is true as well).

3. C2 is identical to C1, so it also holds in every state.

4. C3 is (C1 holds) or (C2 holds). Since C1 (and C2) hold, C3 is true.

- C1 (event1 eventually happens) is satisfied from the initial state.
- C2 (""if event2 happens then C1 holds"") holds in any state where event2 is true because the rule forces event1 next; in states where event2 is false the implication is vacuously true.

2. Therefore C3 (""C1 holds or C2 holds"") is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens.""

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false in the initial state (event1 is not true; event2 is).

Trace the system:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so in the next state (state1) event2 holds. Therefore C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2 at the initial state requires C1 to be true in the next state (i.e., at state1). At state1 event2 holds; and after event2 no other events can happen, so the next state (state2) also has event2. Thus C1 is true at state1, so C2 is true at the initial state.

Step 2 — use the context:

1. Context: Initially event1 happened.
2. Rule: After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore, once in the initial state (where event1 holds), no transition to a state with event2 can ever occur. Concretely, event2 cannot happen at any future state.
3. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true in the initial state and in every future state.

1. C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — a -> a — which is a tautology, so C1 holds in every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system alternates: starting at event2, the only possible trace is ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
2. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C1 is true in any state where the current event is event2 (because next is event1), and false in any state where the current event is event1 (because next is event2).
3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" 
   - If the current state is event2, C1 already holds, so C2 holds.
   - If the current state is event1, the next state is event2, and in that next state C1 holds, so C1 holds eventually; hence C2 holds.
4. Therefore, in every state where event1 happens, C2 does hold. So the implication ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" (C3) is true."

- C1 is ""Event2 and Event2"", which is equivalent to just ""Event2"".
- So C2 is ""Eventually C1"", i.e. ""Eventually Event2"".
- C3 is ""If Event2 happens, then Eventually Event2"".

Step 2 — use the context
- The rules force alternation: initial state is Event1, and after Event1 comes Event2, after Event2 comes Event1, so Event2 occurs infinitely often (every other state).

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- If ""eventually"" can include the current state, then whenever Event2 holds now, ""eventually Event2"" holds immediately (current state), so the implication holds.
- If ""eventually"" requires a strict future, alternation still guarantees Event2 will recur two steps later, so the implication still holds.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. From the context the system alternates: s0 = event2 (initial), s1 = event1 (must follow), s2 = event2, s3 = event1, ... forever.

2. C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"" (¬event1). C1 is true in states with event2 (s0, s2, ...), false in states with event1 (s1, s3, ...).

3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (Next C1). So C2 is true at a state exactly when the immediately following state has event2.

   - At s0: the next state s1 has event1, so C1 is false at s1 ⇒ C2 is false at s0.
   - At s1: the next state s2 has event2, so C1 is true at s2 ⇒ C2 is true at s1.

4. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (Next C2). So C3 is true at s0 if C2 is true at s1. As shown, C2 is true at s1, hence C3 is true at s0.

Therefore C3 is True."

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true (state S0).
- After event1, no other events can happen → the system stays at event1 in all future states (S1, S2, ... all have event1 true).
- (The rule about event2 is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Evaluate the formulas (all state-relative):
- C1 at a state means: ""event1 holds in the next state."" Since every future state has event1, C1 is true in every state (in particular at S0, S1, ...).
- C2 at a state is the implication: ""If C1 holds (at this state), then event1 holds (at this state)."" In every state C1 is true and event1 is also true, so the implication is true in every state.
- C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is true in every state, C2 is true in the next state (S1). Thus C3 is true at the initial state.

1. From the context the system alternates: initially event2, then event1 must occur, then event2 must occur, then event1, etc. So event1 does occur (and event2 does not hold in every state).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context: initially event2. After event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2 — so the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2. Simplify C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (C1 = event1).

3. C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" → ""event1 and event2"" (both must be true in the same state).

4. In this model only one event holds in any given state, so event1 and event2 cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore C2 is false in every state.

5. C3 asserts ""C2 always holds"". Since C2 is always false, C3 is false.

- From event1 the next state must be event2.
So the system alternates: ... event2 (t=0) → event1 (t=1) → event2 (t=2) → event1 (t=3) → ...

Step 2 — unpack the formulas:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false in the same state).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" (both true in the same state).

Step 3 — check whether C3 can ever be true:
- At any state where event1 holds (e.g., t=1, t=3,...), the next state is event2, so C1 is true there. Thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false whenever event1 holds. So C2 and event1 cannot be true together.
- At any state where C2 is true (i.e., C1 is false), the current event is event2, not event1, so event1 is false there.

Therefore there is no state where both C2 and event1 hold simultaneously. C3 is never true.

- After event2, event1 must happen (so time1: event1).

Context summary and trace:
- Initial state: event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → next state: event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen → from then on, event2 stays true forever.

Evaluate the conditions:
1. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
   - At the initial state this is true (event1 is true now).
   - At the next state (and thereafter), this is false because no future state has event1 true.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds.""
   - This requires C1 to be true at every state along the run.
   - Since C1 is false at the next state, C2 is false (already at the next state).

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
1. Initially event1 holds.
2. The context says: after event1, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event1 forever (event2 never occurs).
3. C1 is ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" — evaluated in a state where event1 holds, this implication requires event2 to also hold in that same state. Since event2 does not hold when event1 holds, C1 is false in the initial state.
4. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state from the initial state is again event1, so C1 is still false there; hence C2 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen → the system stays at event2 forever (event1 can never occur).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., event1 is true in every state).
- In the model event1 never happens, so C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 = (C1) OR (event1).

1. C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" So C3 is true only if (a) C2 holds and (b) event2 does happen in some state.

2. C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event1 and event2"" (i.e., both hold in the same state).

3. From the context: initially event1 holds (state S0). After event1, event2 must happen, so the next state S1 has event2. After event2, no other events can happen, so S1 (event2) persists. We assume, as in the examples, that at any single state only one event atom is true.

4. C1 requires event1 and event2 to be true simultaneously in a single state. No such state exists: S0 has event1 only, S1 has event2 only. Therefore C1 is false in every state.

5. At a state where event2 is true (S1), the antecedent of C2 is true but the consequent C1 is false, so the implication in C2 is false. Thus C2 does not hold.

6. C3 requires C2 to hold and event2 to happen. Although event2 does happen (S1), C2 is false, so the conjunction C3 is false.

   Thus the sequence of states is: event2 (initial), then event1, then event1, ...

   - After event1, no other events can happen — so any next state from event1 must again be event1 (event1 states are stable).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (but event2 never occurs here because we start at event1 and event1 forbids other events).

2. C1 = (event2 AND event1). This requires both event2 and event1 to be true in the same state. As in the examples, only one event can be true in a single state, so C1 is impossible (always false).

2. Interpret the hypothesis as state formulas:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" means in a given state C1 = (event1 -> event2).
   - C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" means in a given state C2 = (event2 AND C1).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" means C2 must hold in every state (including the initial state).

3. Evaluate at the initial state: event1 is true and event2 is false, so C1 = (true -> false) = false. Therefore C2 = (event2 AND C1) = (false AND false) = false.

4. Because C2 is false in the initial state, C2 does not hold in all states. Thus C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

1. From the context: initial state has event2 true. The rules force strict alternation: after event2 the next state is event1, and after event1 the next state is event2. So the trace is event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2. Simplify the hypotheses:
   - C1: (event2 AND event2) — this is equivalent to event2.
   - C2: C1 AND event1 — i.e. (event2) AND event1, meaning event1 and event2 must both hold in the same state.
   - C3: C2 holds in the next state.

3. In this model each state has exactly one event true (the system alternates), so no state can have both event1 and event2 true simultaneously. Thus C2 is false in every state.

4. If C2 is never true, then C2 cannot hold in any next state either. Therefore C3 is false.

Reasoning:
1. Initial state: event2 is true.
2. After event2, no other events can happen, so all future states remain event2.
3. C1 is the state formula ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" (event2 -> event1). In any state where event2 is true and event1 is not true simultaneously, C1 is false.
4. Since states with event2 do not have event1 (events are exclusive) and the system stays at event2 forever, C1 is false in the initial and all future states.
5. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
6. C3 is ""if event2 happens then C2 holds"". The antecedent is true (event2 happens initially) but C2 is false, so C3 is false."

1. Context: initially event1 holds. After event1, no other events can happen — by the same interpretation as the examples, that means the system stays at event1 in all future states (event1 holds now and in the next state, and forever). After event2 no other events can happen is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the context, event1 does happen in the next state (the state persists as event1). So C1 is True.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — this is the negation of C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False.

   - After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the above).

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, C2 is true.

4. Initially event1 happened.

Reasoning:
1. From the context, the system alternates: initially event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, ...
2. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would require event1 in every state — but event2 occurs in every other state, so C1 is false.
3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") requires that the next state satisfy C1. Since C1 is false (it fails at states with event2), C2 is false already at the initial state (the next state is event2, so C1 fails there).
4. C3 (""C2 always holds"") therefore fails because C2 is not true in every state.

Thus C3 is False."

1. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., in every state).
2. C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""
3. C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens.""
4. So C2 is (event1 ∨ event2) → event2. This is equivalent to event1 → event2 (because event2 → event2 is always true).
5. The system alternates starting from event2: initial state event2, next state event1, then event2, then event1, ...
6. In states where event1 holds, event2 does not hold in the same state, so event1 → event2 is false in those states.
7. Therefore C2 is not true in all states, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 holds it persists).

Hypothesis pieces:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., event1 holds at every state).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" (a disjunction evaluated at the current state).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" (an implication evaluated when event2 holds).

Reasoning:
1. At the initial state event2 is true and event1 is false.
2. From the context, in the next state event1 becomes true and then stays true forever.
3. C1 (event1 always happens) requires event1 to hold at the initial state as well as later states. But event1 is false initially, so C1 is false.
4. C2 at the initial state is ""event1 or C1"" = false or false = false.
5. C3 requires that whenever event2 happens, C2 holds. At the initial state event2 happens but C2 is false, so the implication fails there.

Therefore C3 is False.

3. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at any given state, C2 requires that from the next state onward event1 always holds.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is true exactly in states where the current state is event2 (because from event2 the next state is event1). C1 is false in states that are event1 (their next state is event2).

3. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" That requires the current state to have event1 and the next state to have event1 simultaneously.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context forces alternation: initial state = event1, then event2, then event1, etc. So event1 and event2 alternate; exactly one event holds in any state.

2. C1 = (event2 AND event1) requires both events in the same state. That is impossible here, so C1 is false in every state.

3. C2 = (if C1 then event2). Since C1 is never true, this implication is vacuously true in every state. So C2 holds everywhere.

4. C3 = (C2 holds AND event2 happens). With C2 true everywhere, C3 is equivalent to “event2 holds” in the current state.

5. At the initial state event1 holds (not event2), so C3 is false at the initial state.

Therefore, C3 is False. (Note: C3 does hold in the states where event2 occurs, but it does not hold initially.)"

1. C3 says: ""C2 eventually holds.""

2. C2 is: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""

3. C1 is: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., from that state onward, every state has event1).

4. From the context the timeline is:
   - Initial state: event2.
   - Next state: event1 (must follow event2).
   - After event1, no other events can happen, so all subsequent states are event1.

5. Consider possible states:
   - In the initial state event2 is true, but event1 is not true in that state, so C1 (""event1 always holds from that state"") is false at the initial state. Thus C2 is false at the initial state (because C1 is false even though event2 is true).
   - In any later state (starting at the first event1 state), C1 is true (from that point onward event1 always holds), but event2 is not true in those states. So C2 is false there as well.

6. There is no state where both C1 and event2 hold simultaneously, so C2 never holds.

7. Therefore C2 never eventually holds, so C3 is False.

1. Interpret the formulas:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1) — i.e., at every state, the next state has event2.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2) — i.e., in the next state, C2 is true.

2. From the context the transitions are:
   - Initial state s0: event2.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → s1 is event1.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → s1, s2, ... are all event1 (event1 is a sink).

   So the run is: s0(event2) → s1(event1) → s2(event1) → ...

3. Evaluate C1 (= ""next state is event2""):
   - At s0, next state s1 is event1, so C1 is false at s0.
   - At s1, next state s2 is event1, so C1 is false at s1.
   - Thus C1 is false at every state.

4. Hence C2 (G C1) is false (C1 does not always hold). Therefore C2 does not hold in the next state either.

1. Context summary:
   - Initial state s0: event2 is true.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → once in an event2 state, every next state is also event2 (it stays at event2 forever).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (not needed here since event1 never occurs in the run starting at s0).

2. Interpret the hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — at a state s this means the immediate successor state has event2 true.
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — at a state s this is (C1 → event1 at s).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some state (now or in the future) where C2 is true.

3. Evaluate on the actual run:
   - At s0: the next state s1 has event2 (because it stays at event2), so C1 is true at s0. But event1 is false at s0 (s0 is an event2 state), so the implication C1 → event1 is false at s0; thus C2 is false at s0.
   - The same holds at every subsequent state: every state is an event2 state, C1 is true (next is event2), event1 is false, so C2 is false everywhere.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Initial state: event2 is true (event1 is false).
2. By the rules, the next state must be event1, and from that point event1 stays true forever.
3. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") requires event1 to be true in the initial state and all future states — but the initial state has event2, so C1 is false.
4. C2 (""C1 always holds"") therefore is false as well (C1 does not hold from the initial state).

- C1 and C2 are identical (""Event1 always happens""), so C3 (C1 or C2) is equivalent to just ""Event1 always happens.""

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 is true (so event1 is not true in the initial state).
- From event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs it persists).

Step 3 — evaluate ""always""
- ""Event1 always happens"" means event1 is true in every state (including the initial state).
- The initial state has event2, not event1, so event1 is not true in that state.

2. C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Thus C2 holds exactly in states where event1 holds.

3. The context: initially event2 happens, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the system stays at event2 forever; event1 never occurs (there is no transition to event1).

4. Therefore C2 is false in the initial state (and at all times), because event1 never happens.

1. From the context: initial state (time 0) is event2. The rules force strict alternation: after event2 → event1, after event1 → event2. So the infinite trace is: time0: event2, time1: event1, time2: event2, time3: event1, … (alternating).

2. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state"" = X event1. So C1 is true at a state exactly when the following state is event1. In our trace, C1 is true at time0 (because time1 is event1), true at time2? time3 is event1 so C1 true at time2? Wait time2's next is time3 which is event1, so C1 true at even times as well where next is event1; more simply C1 is true at states whose next state is event1.

3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X C1 = XX event1. So C2 is true at time t iff event1 holds at time t+2. In the trace, event1 holds only at odd times (1,3,5,…). Therefore event1 does not hold at time2. In particular at time0, event1 at time2 is false, so C2 is false at time0.

1. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to just ""Event1 happens"" (a conjunction with itself).
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" = not(C1).
3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" = not(C2) = not(not(C1)) = C1. So C3 is equivalent to C1.
4. We evaluate these at the initial state. The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in the initial state event1 is false.
5. Therefore C1 (Event1 happens) is false in the initial state, hence C3 is false.

1. Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen — so the system stays in the event1 state (event1 holds from the start and there is no transition to event2). (After event2 also no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, event2 never occurs, so C1 is True.

3. C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" At the initial state event1 happens, and C1 also holds, so C2 is True.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — this is the negation of C2. Since C2 is True, C3 is False.

Answer: False"
