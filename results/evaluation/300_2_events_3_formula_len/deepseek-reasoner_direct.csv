</graphml>",1,"Based on the context provided, events alternate indefinitely: initially event1 happened, then event2 must happen after event1, and event1 must happen after event2. This means event2 happens infinitely often throughout the sequence.

- C1 states that event2 eventually happens. Since event2 occurs repeatedly in the sequence, C1 is always true from any point in time.
- C2 states that if event2 happens, then C1 holds. Since C1 is always true, the implication ""if event2 happens then C1"" is always true, regardless of whether event2 is occurring at that moment. Thus, C2 always holds.
- C3 states that C2 always holds, which is confirmed by the reasoning above.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context, event2 happened initially, and after event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore, event1 happens exactly once in the sequence.

C1 states ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Since event1 happens once, the statement ""event1 happens"" is true, and thus the conjunction ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" is logically equivalent to ""event1 happens,"" which is true. Therefore, C1 is true.

C2 states that C1 does not hold. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
