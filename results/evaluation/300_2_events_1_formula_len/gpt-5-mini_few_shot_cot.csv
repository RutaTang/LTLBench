1. The hypothesis C1 is the formula (event2 → event2).
2. In propositional logic (and in each state of a temporal model), p → p is a tautology — it is always true: if p is true then p is true, and if p is false the implication is vacuously true.
3. In the given context, event2 never actually occurs (initially event1, and after event1 no other events can happen), but that only strengthens the point: the antecedent is never true, so the implication holds vacuously.
4. Therefore C1 is true in all states of the model.

1. Context gives the possible trace: initially event2 holds. After event2, event1 must hold next. After event1, no other events can happen, so event1 holds thereafter. So the sequence of states is: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event1, ...

2. C1 reads as a propositional implication in a single state: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., whenever a state has event1, that same state must also have event2).

3. In state1 (and subsequent states) event1 holds but event2 does not (only one event holds per state). Thus there are states where event1 is true and event2 is false, violating the implication.

1. Hypothesis: C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""
2. Context facts:
   - Initially, event2 happened (initial state: event2 = true).
   - After event2, event1 must happen. (Interpreted as: in the next state after any state where event2 holds, event1 holds.)
   - After event1, no other events can happen. (Interpreted as: once in a state with event1, only event1 can hold in that and following states — it persists.)
3. Starting at the initial state, event2 is true.
4. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state after the initial state must have event1 true.
5. Therefore event1 occurs (in that next state), so event1 does eventually happen.

3. Consider the state immediately after the initial one: it is a state where event2 happens. In that state event1 does not hold (the events alternate and only one event holds in a state).

4. In that state the antecedent (event2) is true and the consequent (event1) is false, so the implication is false.

1. Interpret the hypothesis: C1 says ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreting this as a state implication (event2 -> event1) — the same style used in the examples — means: in any state, if event2 is true then event1 must also be true in that state. (If one instead reads it temporally as ""whenever event2 occurs then later event1 occurs"", the context also enforces that, see step 6.)

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. From the examples' convention, that means the only possible next state from event1 is event1 again (event1 persists).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (if a state with event2 occurred, the next state would be event1).

3. Because the system starts in event1 and the only successor of event1 is event1, event2 never occurs on any reachable path.

4. A logical implication (event2 -> event1) is true vacuously in any state where event2 is false. Since event2 never holds in any reachable state, the implication holds in all reachable states.

5. (Alternate reading) If the intended meaning was ""whenever event2 occurs then thereafter event1 occurs"", the context already requires that after event2 the next state is event1, so that reading would also make C1 true.

Reasoning:
1. Initially event1 is true.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means from any state with event1 the only possible next event is event1 again (the system stays at event1).
3. Therefore the run is event1, event1, event1, ... forever.

1. Initially event2 is true.
2. After event2, no other events can happen — so from the initial state the system stays at event2 and event1 never occurs along any reachable trace.
3. The context also states that after event1, event2 must happen — so in any (hypothetical) case where event1 occurs, event2 follows.
4. Therefore, in all reachable behaviors either event1 never happens (making ""if event1 then event2"" vacuously true) or, if event1 did occur, the rule guarantees event2 happens afterwards.
5. Hence the implication ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" holds in all cases.

1. Initially event2 is true.
2. After event2, event1 must happen — so the next state has event1 true.
3. After event1, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event1 thereafter.
4. In this model, atomic event propositions refer to the current state, and at any state only one event holds.
5. C1 is ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" — this requires both event1 and event2 to be true in the same state.
6. There is no state where both are true simultaneously (initial state: event2 only; later states: event1 only).

Therefore C1 is False.

1. Initially event1 is true.
2. The context says: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once in an event1 state, the only possible subsequent state is again event1 (event1 is absorbing); there is no transition from event1 to event2.
3. The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" only constrains what happens if event2 occurs; it does not create a way for event2 to occur from event1.

Reasoning:
1. Initially event2 is true.
2. The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means the system stays at event2 from that point onward (no transition to event1 is allowed).
3. The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" only constrains what happens after event1; it does not enable event1 to occur.

1. Interpret C1 as a state-level implication: ""If event2 happens (now), then event1 happens (now)."" (This matches how similar hypotheses are used in the examples.)

3. At the initial state: event2 = true and event1 = false.

Reasoning:
1. C1 means: in any state, if event1 is true then event2 is true in that same state (no temporal operator is present).
2. The context says initially event1 happened, so the initial state has event1 = true.
3. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" implies no other event (including event2) can be true in that state or follow it. Thus event2 is false in the initial state.
