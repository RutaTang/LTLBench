Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (Interpreted as: event1 → event2.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (Interpreted as: once event2 occurs, the sequence ends.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is specified: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- No C2, C3, etc. were provided; if you have others, list them and I can evaluate them too.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial condition (event1 happened) and Rule A (event1 → event2), it follows that event2 happens.
- C1 asserts the opposite (event2 does not happen), so C1 contradicts the premises.

Conclusion: Given the premises as stated, C1 is false. (If by ""must"" you meant something weaker than a logical/casual necessity—e.g., a recommendation that can be ignored—then C1 could be possible; clarify if you intended a weaker reading.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Given event1 happened and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 does happen, so the claim ""Event2 does not happen"" is false. (If ""must"" were weaker than logical necessity, you'd need to clarify.)"

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened. The context also says that after event1 occurs no other events can happen. So in the actual run defined by the context, event2 cannot occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs: no further events are possible (terminal state).
- After event2 occurs: no further events are possible (event2 is also terminal if it ever occurs).
- So both events are terminal, and given the initial condition (event1 happened) the run ends there and event2 does not occur in that run.

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- You only gave one sub-condition, C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
- Interpreting this as a logical implication: C1 is the formula event2 → event2. That is an instance of the general form A → A.
- A → A is a tautology in classical logic: it is true whenever A is true (since then A follows), and it is also true whenever A is false (material implication is vacuously true when the antecedent is false).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Even though in the given scenario event2 cannot happen (because event1 already occurred and blocks further events), that factual impossibility does not make the implication event2 → event2 false. If event2 never occurs, the implication is vacuously true; if event2 did occur in some other scenario, the consequent is the same as the antecedent so it would be true. Thus C1 holds in all cases.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is the formula event2 → event2, which is a tautology (A → A is always true); it's also vacuously true in the given run where event2 cannot occur."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — what the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1 is the statement ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" (logical inclusive OR). C1 is true exactly when at least one of event1 or event2 occurs.
- There are no C2, C3 given in the problem; only C1 is specified.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final judgment
- The premises say event2 did happen initially, and then event1 must also happen. So in fact both event2 and event1 occur (in that order).
- Since at least one of them occurs (indeed both occur), the disjunction ""event1 or event2"" is true.

Conclusion: C1 is True (necessarily true given the premises).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial time).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur sometime later.
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime later.

(Interpretation: “after X, Y must happen” means: whenever X happens at time t there exists a later time t' > t at which Y happens.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is written as “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” Logically that is equivalent to “event2 happens.” If you read the two conjuncts as intending two separate occurrences, C1 can be read as “event2 happens at least twice (at two times).” So there are two natural readings:
  1. Weak reading: C1 = event2 happens (at least once).
  2. Strong reading: C1 = event2 happens twice (two distinct occurrences).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth of C1
- We have an initial event2 (satisfies the weak reading immediately).
- By Rule B (after event2 → event1), that initial event2 obliges a later event1.
- By Rule A (after event1 → event2), that event1 obliges another later event2.
- So the system produces event2 at the start and, by the two rules, forces at least one further event1 and then another event2, and so on (an alternating sequence event2 → event1 → event2 → ...).

Conclusion
- Under the natural interpretation of the rules, C1 is True.
  - Under the weak reading (just “event2 happens”) it is true because event2 happened initially.
  - Under the strong reading (two occurrences) it is also true because the rules guarantee a subsequent event2 after the initial one.  

(If you instead intended a different semantics for “after” or “happens” — e.g., nonobligatory rules or a one-shot system that may fail to meet obligations — the answer could change; with the usual temporal/obligation reading above, C1 is true.)

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is a conjunction of the same proposition twice. Logically A ∧ A is equivalent to A. So C1 just asserts that event2 happens.

4) How do these relate?
- The initial condition already ensures event2 happens, so C1 is satisfied.
- The forced occurrence of event1 after event2 and the terminal nature of event1 do not contradict anything relevant to C1.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Interpreted as: once event2 has occurred, event1 will occur at some later time.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (Interpreted similarly: once event1 occurs, event2 will occur later.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens” — i.e. at some time after the start, event1 occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Given the initial condition that event2 has happened and Rule A (“after event2, event1 must happen”), event1 is guaranteed to occur at some point. The second rule (after event1, event2 must happen) may cause the two events to alternate repeatedly, but that does not prevent event1 from occurring at least once.
- Therefore C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen.
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen.
(Each of these says the world is terminal once that event occurs.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is written as ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"".
- Interpreted as a propositional conjunction (event2 ∧ event2): this is redundant and logically equivalent to simply ""event2 happens"".
- Alternatively, if one reads C1 as saying ""event2 happens twice (two distinct occurrences)"", that is a different, temporal interpretation requiring two sequential occurrences.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Under the standard propositional reading (event2 ∧ event2 ≡ event2): since event2 happened initially, C1 is True.
- Under the temporal reading that requires two separate occurrences: the rules say that after event2 no further events can happen, so a second occurrence of event2 cannot occur; thus C1 would be False in that interpretation.

Summary answer: C1 is True if you mean the logical conjunction (redundant) — False if you mean two distinct occurrences of event2.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: Interpreting C1 as the propositional conjunction (event2 ∧ event2), it's equivalent to ""event2 happens"", which is true because event2 happened initially. (If one instead demands two distinct temporal occurrences of event2, that would be impossible given the rules and thus false, but the standard logical reading yields True.)"

Answer: C1 is True (event1 does not happen), under the usual reading. Reasoning step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 has happened (so at the start of the scenario event2 is true/has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs at some time t, then at some later time t'≥t event2 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred, the execution terminates — no further events, including event1, can occur afterward.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1 states: ""Event1 does not happen."" (No occurrence of event1 at any time in the execution being considered.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since event2 has already happened initially, Rule B makes the state terminal: no events may occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- Is it possible event1 happened before the initial event2? The statement ""Initially, event2 happened"" normally specifies the initial state, i.e., what has happened up to the start of the scenario. Unless the problem explicitly allows a history before that initial state, we assume no earlier events occurred. Under that standard interpretation, event1 did not occur prior to the initial event2, and cannot occur afterward because event2 is terminal.
- Consequently, C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is true.

Note on alternative reading: If you allow a prior history where event1 happened strictly before the initial point, that would also be consistent with the rules (event1 → event2), so then C1 could be false. But with the usual interpretation that the initial facts describe everything that has happened up to the start, C1 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True. Event2 already occurred initially and is terminal (no events may follow), so event1 cannot occur under the usual reading."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (This enforces that once event2 has occurred, event1 occurs subsequently.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: it is followed by no events.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” This specifically asserts that immediately in the state following the initial one, event1 occurs.
- (No C2/C3 were given; if there were, we would interpret them similarly.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition we know event2 has happened.
- Rule A says that after event2, event1 must happen. If “after” is read as “in the immediate next state,” then the next state must contain event1 — so C1 is true.
- Caveat about ambiguity: if “after” only means “at some later point (eventually) after event2,” it does not necessarily force event1 to occur in the immediate next state; it could occur after one or more intervening states. In that reading C1 (event1 in the next state) is not guaranteed by the premises and would be undetermined/false as an entailment.

Conclusion
- Under the usual reading that “after event2” means immediately next, C1 is True.
- If “after” was intended in the weaker sense “eventually after,” C1 is not necessarily entailed.

Short answer: True — C1 is true.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (That is, once event1 has occurred, event2 is required to occur at some later point.)
- Rule B: After event2 no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 (the hypothesis) is: Event2 eventually happens. (i.e., there exists some time after the start at which event2 occurs.)
- No other C2, C3 were provided in the problem statement.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the conclusion?
- Since event1 has already happened initially, Rule A applies and forces event2 to occur at some later time. Rule B only restricts what happens after event2 (makes it terminal); it does not prevent event2 from occurring.
- Therefore event2 must indeed eventually happen.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 has happened (so at time t=0, event1 occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 occurs at time t, event1 must occur at time t+1.
- Rule B: After event1 occurs at time t, no other events can happen at time t+1. (I read this as: any state immediately following an occurrence of event1 has no events.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” means event1 occurs at the state immediately after the initial state (i.e., at t=1).

Step 4 — how the conditions interact and conclusion
- The initial state had event1 at t=0.
- By Rule B, no events can occur at t=1 (the state after an event1).
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at t=1.
- Rule A (after event2 → event1) is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

Conclusion: C1 is False.

- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 implies that event1 will occur later.)

These rules are consistent: given event2 initially, event1 must occur afterward, and once event1 occurs nothing else can happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1 is stated as ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" Logically, (P or P) is equivalent to P, so C1 just means ""Event2 happens.""

- The initial condition explicitly says event2 happened, so the atomic proposition ""Event2 happens"" is true.
- Therefore C1 (which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"") is True.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (i.e., at the start of every execution/run, event1 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus both event1 and event2 are terminal events: once either occurs, the run ends (no further events).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted as: in every possible execution/run of the system, event1 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate
- Because the initial condition already states event1 happened at the start of every run, event1 does indeed occur in every run. The ""after event1 no other events can happen"" rule simply prevents any other events (including event2) from occurring afterward, but it does not contradict the initial occurrence of event1.
- Therefore C1 is true under the given description.

(If you intended ""always happens"" to mean something else — e.g., holds at every moment in time rather than ""occurs in every run"" — say so and I can re-evaluate that reading.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1, if it occurs, is terminal — nothing happens after it.)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (event2, if it occurs, is also terminal.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is the statement ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" (logical OR). C1 is true exactly when at least one of event1 or event2 occurs at some point.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- We are told event2 did happen initially. That alone satisfies the disjunction ""event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- The terminal rules only restrict what can happen after either event occurs (they do not invalidate the fact that event2 already happened).
- Therefore C1 is True.

(If you meant ""happens"" in a different tense/technical sense — e.g., ""will happen in the future from now"" — the same conclusion holds because event2 already occurred, so the disjunction is still satisfied. The only ambiguity would be if you require both events to be future occurrences after the initial moment, but that is not how the given C1 is stated.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the initial time).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then later event2 will occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then later event1 will occur.)
- These rules create an alternation: since event2 happened initially, event1 must happen later, then event2 again, and so on.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1 is: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens.""
  - Logically, (A or A) is equivalent to A. So C1 simply means ""Event2 happens.""
- There are no C2, C3 given in the problem.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final judgment
- The context states event2 already happened initially, so the statement ""event2 happens"" is true (at least at the initial time).
- Therefore C1 (which is just a redundant form of ""event2 happens"") is True — it is entailed by the context.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the initial time (call it t0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 happens, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs at time t, there will be some t' > t with event1 at t').
- Rule B: After event1 happens, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs at time t, there will be some t' > t with event2 at t').

Step 3 — what C1 (and any similar conditions) means
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” That means there is some time (now or later) at which event2 holds. (If you interpret “eventually” as strictly in the future, it means there will be some t' > now with event2 at t'.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- At t0 event2 is already true, so under the usual (non-strict) reading of “eventually” C1 is immediately satisfied.
- Under the strict-future reading, the rules force a future occurrence anyway: from event2 at t0, Rule A gives some t1>t0 with event1; then Rule B gives some t2>t1 with event2. So event2 occurs again at t2, satisfying the strict-future reading.
- Furthermore, the two rules create an ongoing alternation (event2 → event1 → event2 → …), so event2 will occur repeatedly.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true/has occurred at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen — event2 is terminal (nothing can occur after it).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen — if event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards (event1 ⇒ event2).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" is the logical disjunction (event2 ∨ event1): it is true if at least one of event2 or event1 occurs.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Since event2 already happened (given), the disjunction event2 ∨ event1 is true regardless of whether event1 occurs. The transition rules do not invalidate that: rule A only prevents events after event2, and rule B only requires that any occurrence of event1 be followed by event2 (which is already satisfied here if event1 had occurred earlier). In any case, because event2 is true, C1 holds.

Therefore C1 is True. (Only caveat: if you use a nonstandard meaning of “happens” that excludes past occurrences, the conclusion might be re-evaluated, but with the usual reading “event2 happened initially,” C1 is true.)

Answer (short): C1 is True, given the usual interpretation that ""eventually"" includes the initial moment. Below are the steps and reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (i.e., at time 0 the system is in a state where event1 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs, there must be a later point (possibly immediately) where event1 occurs. This is a liveness obligation triggered by event2.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreted as: event1 is terminal — once event1 has occurred, the system admits no further events (neither event1 again nor event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Usually means: there exists some time at or after now when event1 holds/has occurred.
- (If you intended other subconditions: for example, C2 might be the obligation that if event2 happens then event1 must follow; C3 might be the terminality of event1. But only C1 was specified in your hypothesis.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C1 true or false?
- Because the initial condition states event1 has already happened, C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is satisfied immediately. In standard temporal logic semantics, ""eventually"" (F) is true if the property holds now or at some future time; thus C1 is True.
- Additional consistency check: Rule B (event1 is terminal) prevents any later events (including event2) after the initial event1, but that does not contradict C1. Rule A places an obligation on any occurrence of event2, but since event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, that obligation is vacuously irrelevant here.
- Caveat about interpretations: if you mean ""event1 will happen sometime strictly in the future (excluding the initial moment),"" then under Rule B C1 (in that strict sense) would be False, because no events can happen after the initial event1. Under the standard inclusive notion of ""eventually,"" C1 is True.

Conclusion: Under the usual interpretation where ""eventually"" may include the current/initial state, C1 is True. If you intended a strictly future occurrence, then C1 would be False.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
- Because event1 already happened initially, no further events can occur after that point (so event2 does not occur).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is stated as: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is a disjunction of the same proposition with itself. Logically it is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens."" (The duplicated disjunct adds no information.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The initial fact that event1 happened makes the proposition ""Event1 happens"" true.
- The transition rules prevent any other events after event1, but that does not affect the truth of ""Event1 happens"" itself.

Conclusion about C1:
- C1 is True, because event1 did happen initially. (Also, C1 is a redundant tautology of the single fact ""event1 happens"".)

Short answer: Most natural reading => C1 is False. Explanation below step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state. (No statement that event2 has happened initially.)

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen.
Interpretation: occurrence of event1 (or event2) leads to a state from which there are no further event-occurrence transitions (a terminal/no-more-events state).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This says that in the state immediately following the current (initial) state, event1 holds/occurs.

4) How they relate → evaluation of C1
- Under the usual reading of “after event1 no other events can happen” the initial state is terminal with respect to events (there is no further event-occurrence transition after the initial event1). Therefore there is no “next state” in which a new event occurs; so the claim that event1 “happens in the next state” is false.
- Note the only alternative reading: if you treat “happened” as a persistent property (once event1 has happened it stays true in all future states) and you allow a next state to exist that simply has no new events but retains the fact “event1 has happened,” then C1 would be True. This is a different semantics (persistence of facts vs. one-time occurrences).

Conclusion: With the standard interpretation that events are one-time occurrences and “after event1 no other events can happen” means no successor event-state exists, C1 is False. If you instead assume persistent facts and an existing successor state, C1 could be True — but that is not the common reading.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true at the start.

2) What are the transition rules?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is terminal (if it happens, nothing can follow).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is also terminal.
- There are no rules that force any other event to occur after the initial state.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just the conjunction of the same proposition with itself, which is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""

4) How do these relate?
- The initial fact already guarantees ""event1 happens.""
- The terminal rule about event1 only prevents further events; it does not negate that event1 happened.
- Therefore the proposition ""event1 happens"" is true, and the redundant conjunction in C1 is true as well.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state (i.e., at the start of every possible execution).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has happened, the execution stops — no further events are possible.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever happens, then event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — what the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This phrase is ambiguous; two natural readings are:
  - (Weak reading) “Event1 occurs in every possible execution at least once.” (i.e., in all traces there is some timepoint where event1 happens.)
  - (Strong reading) “Event1 holds at every timepoint (an invariant).” (or “event1 happens at all times”.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the truth of C1
- Because event1 is given to have happened initially, under the weak reading C1 is true: in every execution event1 has already occurred (at the initial time). So C1 is entailed.
- The rule “After event1, no other events can happen” means event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, so rule B (after event2, event1 must happen) is vacuously satisfied — event2 never occurs in any execution.
- Under the strong reading (that event1 must hold at every timepoint), the statement is not well supported by the premises. The premises only say event1 happened initially; they do not assert that event1 continues to hold at all later times (and since events are instantaneous, interpreting “always” as an invariant would be false or at least unsupported).

Conclusion
- Under the standard (weak) interpretation — “event1 occurs in every execution” — C1 is True.
- If you intended the stronger invariant reading — “event1 holds at every timepoint” — the premises do not prove that, so C1 would be False or at best undecided.

Short answer: C1 is True (under the usual reading that “always happens” means “happens in every possible execution/run”). Below are the requested steps and the reasoning.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (i.e., the initial state includes event1).

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Commonly this is read as “in every possible execution/run, event1 occurs (at some point).” Note: there is an alternative, stronger reading — “event1 holds at every time point” — which is a different temporal claim; I discuss that below.

4) How do the conditions relate and conclusion?
- Because the initial condition explicitly states event1 happened, every execution starts with event1. The rule “after event1 no other events can happen” simply makes that execution end immediately after event1, but it does not prevent event1 from having happened. Therefore under the usual interpretation (“happens in every run”), C1 is True.
- Additional note on ambiguity: If “always” were interpreted as “at every moment in time (globally true at all time points),” then C1 would be false — event1 occurred at the initial moment but does not (and cannot) be continually “happening” at later times. The intended entailment in these problems is typically the first reading, so C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (This says event1 is required to occur at some point after event2.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Once event1 occurs, there are no further events in later states.)

Step 3 — what C1 (and possible other sub-conditions) means
- C1 is the specific claim: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately in the state following the initial state).
- You mentioned C2, C3 but didn’t define them; if there were other Ci they would be other claims about which events occur in which states.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and whether C1 is true
- If Rule A is to be read as an immediate-next requirement (temporal-next: X event1 after event2), then event1 must occur in the next state, so C1 is True.
- If Rule A is to be read as an eventuality requirement (temporal-eventually: F event1 after event2), it only requires that event1 occur at some future state (not necessarily the immediate next state). In that reading C1 does not necessarily follow from the premises — other events or silent steps could occur in the next state(s) before event1 happens, so C1 is not guaranteed (undetermined / False without more information).

Short conclusion
- Under the usual ambiguous English reading, the statement is underspecified. Conclude:
  - If ""after"" = ""immediately after"": C1 is True.
  - If ""after"" = ""eventually after"": C1 is not guaranteed (cannot be concluded).

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. at the initial moment event1 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is the proposition event1 → event1.
- In propositional logic this is an instance of the identity (or reflexivity) tautology P → P, which is always true.
- Interpreting temporally or in the model given: since event1 did happen initially, both the antecedent and consequent are true, so the implication is true in the model as well.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The transition rules (event1 forces event2 later; event2 is terminal) constrain what can happen after event1 but do not affect the truth of event1 → event1.
- C1 is independent of those rules: it is tautologically true (and also true in the given scenario because event1 occurred).

Conclusion: C1 is True.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so the trace contains event1 at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event1, event2 must happen” means: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur later (event1 → eventually event2).
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means event2 is terminal (once event2 occurs the trace stops).
- Combining those: starting from the initial event1, the only permissible continuation is that event2 occurs afterward, and then the trace ends. A typical allowed trace is: event1 → event2 → end.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 is “Event1 happens or event1 happens.” Logically this is just event1 ∨ event1, which simplifies to event1. (It’s a redundant disjunction, not a new proposition.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C1

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (this is given).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 will occur.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then event2 will occur.)
You can write these as implications: event2 ⇒ event1 and event1 ⇒ event2 (interpreting ""after"" as guaranteeing the occurrence at some later point).

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event1 ⇒ event1.
- This is a logical tautology (reflexivity of implication). In classical logic the statement p ⇒ p is always true, regardless of any other facts.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial fact event2 and the rule event2 ⇒ event1, you can conclude event1 does indeed happen.
- From event1 and event1 ⇒ event2 you get event2 again, and the cycle can continue.
- Independently of this causal/temporal cycle, C1 is true by itself because any proposition implies itself. Even if event1 never happened, event1 ⇒ event1 remains true as a logical tautology; in this scenario event1 does happen (because event2 happened first), but that is not needed to establish C1.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" is the implication event1 → event1. This is an identity/tautology: whenever the antecedent holds, the consequent is the same proposition, so it holds as well.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Whether or not event1 can actually occur in this scenario (given that event2 already happened and is terminal) is irrelevant to the truth of the implication. In classical logic:
  - If event1 does occur, then event1 is true — so the implication holds.
  - If event1 does not occur, the implication is vacuously true (false antecedent implies the implication is true).
- Therefore C1 is true in all cases (it is a logical tautology).

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (event1 → eventually event2).
- Rule B: If event2 happens, then no other events can happen afterwards (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — i.e., there exists some point on the timeline where event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and final verdict
- Since event2 has already occurred in the initial state, C1 is satisfied immediately (there exists an occurrence of event2). The other rules do not invalidate that: Rule A is moot unless event1 occurs, and Rule B only says nothing follows event2. Therefore C1 is True.

(If you intended ""eventually"" to mean strictly in the future after the initial moment, then the answer would depend on whether multiple occurrences of event2 are allowed; under the usual interpretation that existence at any time counts, C1 is True.)

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1. Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initially, E2 happened (so E2 is true at the initial moment).

2. Transition rules
- After E2 happens, no other events can happen (so once E2 has occurred, neither E1 nor any other event can occur afterward).
- After E1 happens, E2 must happen (E1 ⇒ E2).

3. What C1 means
- C1 is the proposition ""E2 happens or E1 happens"" (E2 ∨ E1).

4. How they relate and evaluation
- Since E2 already happened initially, E2 is true.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true; therefore E2 ∨ E1 is true regardless of whether E1 ever occurs.
- The other rules do not contradict this: E1 cannot occur after E2 (because nothing can happen after E2), and E1 ⇒ E2 is satisfied (E2 already true), so the scenario is consistent.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

Answer: C1 is True (under the natural reading of the rules). Explanation step by step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 has already happened (at time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After E1, E2 must happen (i.e., whenever E1 occurs, some later time there will be E2).
- Rule B: After E2, E1 must happen (i.e., whenever E2 occurs, some later time there will be E1).

(“After”/“must happen” is being read as a liveness requirement: occurrence at some later time, not necessarily immediately.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens” — formally: there exists some time t > 0 at which E1 occurs.
(You mentioned C2, C3 but none were given; only C1 is under question.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Starting from the initial E2, Rule B requires that an E1 occur at some later time. Once that E1 occurs, Rule A requires a subsequent E2, and so on. The rules force an alternating sequence E2 → E1 → E2 → E1 ... (at least in terms of the required existence of later occurrences).

Conclusion about C1:
- Given the initial E2 and the rule “after E2, event1 must happen,” C1 (“event1 eventually happens”) is true under the natural interpretation of “must happen” as a liveness requirement.

Note on alternative interpretations:
- If “must happen” were not a guaranteed liveness constraint (for example if the system could halt and thereby violate liveness), or if “after” were intended to mean “immediately next and only if some extra condition holds,” the conclusion could change. Under the usual temporal reading you gave, C1 is true.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal (nothing can occur after it).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal.

3) What C1 says
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (a conditional: whenever event1 occurs, event2 also occurs).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event2 happened initially and nothing can happen after event2, no event (including event1) can occur after that initial event2.
- The only way event1 could occur in a model satisfying the context is to occur at the same initial time as event2; thus in any admissible scenario where event1 happens, event2 also happens.
- Equivalently, event1 cannot occur without event2 given the context (indeed event1 is impossible except possibly simultaneous with event2), so the implication holds (it is vacuously true if event1 never occurs, and true in any case where it does because event2 is present).

Therefore C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” Interpreted naturally, this means that once event1 has occurred the system reaches a state in which no further events occur.
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” Similarly, event2 is also terminal: if event2 occurs, no events follow.

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is the claim “Event1 happens in the next state” (i.e., immediately after the initial state).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule “after event1, no other events can happen” makes the post-event state terminal, there are no events occurring in the next state. Therefore C1 (“event1 happens in the next state”) is False under the standard reading that events are instantaneous occurrences and the rule forbids any subsequent events.
- Note on ambiguity: if “no other events can happen” were read very narrowly to forbid only different events but allow the same event to reoccur, then C1 could be True. The usual interpretation, however, is that no further events at all follow a terminal event, so C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs, there are no later events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur at some time no earlier than that).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — i.e. there exists some time (at or after the initial moment) when event1 occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the verdict
- Because event1 has already happened initially, the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied. The rule about ""after event2 event1 must happen"" does not conflict (it is either vacuously satisfied or moot because event2 cannot occur after event1). The rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" also does not prevent C1 because it only restricts later events.
- Therefore C1 is True.

Caveat: if by ""eventually"" you meant ""at some strictly later time after the initial moment"" (excluding the initial occurrence), then C1 would be false because no events can occur after event1. Under the usual reading that ""eventually"" includes the present/initial occurrence, C1 is True.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it has already occurred at the start).

- After event1 occurs, no other events can occur (event1 is terminal).

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the implication event1 ⇒ event2 (whenever event1 occurs, event2 has occurred as well).

4) How do these conditions relate and is C1 true or false?
- Given the rules, event1 can only occur after event2. Also event2 already happened initially. Therefore any occurrence of event1 is necessarily preceded by (and thus accompanied by) an occurrence of event2. Hence the implication event1 ⇒ event2 holds in this scenario.

Answer: C1 is True (assuming the ordinary inclusive ""or""). Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so ""event1"" is true).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" gives event1 → event2 (if event1 happens, then event2 will happen).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means event2 is terminal, but this does not prevent event1 or event2 from being true.

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" is the logical disjunction event1 ∨ event2 (inclusive OR): it is true if at least one of event1 or event2 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From (1) we have event1 = true. Therefore event1 ∨ event2 is true immediately.
- Moreover, from event1 → event2 we also know event2 will occur, so both are true. Thus the inclusive disjunction is certainly true.

Caveat: if ""or"" were intended as exclusive OR (exactly one of them), then C1 would be false because both events occur. But with the usual inclusive ""or,"" C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start (the initial state).

Step 2 — transition / timing rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., whenever event1 has occurred, event2 will occur at some later point).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal/absorbing).
- Implicitly this yields traces of the form: event1 (initial) → … → event2 → stop. There is no way to have events after event2, and once event1 has happened the system is obliged to reach event2.

Step 3 — meaning of sub-condition C1
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” This asserts that at some time (now or later) event1 holds/occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and verdict on C1
- Because the initial condition states event1 has already happened, C1 is satisfied under the common interpretation of “eventually” that allows the present moment (i.e., “at some time now or in the future”).
- Note on semantics edge-case: if “eventually” were interpreted as strictly “at some time in the future after now” (excluding the present instant), then C1’s truth would depend on whether event1 can reoccur. Given the rules, after the initial event1 the system must go to event2 and then stop, so event1 will not occur again — in that strict-future reading C1 would be false. But under the usual inclusive reading of “eventually” (present allowed), C1 is True.

Final answer
- Under the standard (inclusive) reading of “eventually,” C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Meaning: once event1 occurs at some state, there are no subsequent events in any future state (the run becomes terminal after event1).
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreting the natural reading: when event2 has just happened, event1 is required to occur next.

(Important note about interpretation: “after event2, event1 must happen” can be read two ways: (i) an immediate next-state obligation — event1 must occur in the very next state; or (ii) an eventuality — event1 must occur at some future time, possibly after other intermediate events. The conclusion below uses the standard immediate reading unless you say otherwise.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Concretely: in the state immediately following the initial state s0, event1 occurs.

Step 4 — combine the facts
- We start in s0 where event2 has happened.
- By Rule B (interpreting “after” as next-state obligation), from s0 the next state must have event1.
- That satisfies C1.
- Rule A imposes no contradiction: if event1 occurs in that next state, Rule A simply prevents any events after that state (makes the run terminal).

Conclusion
- Under the standard immediate interpretation of “after event2, event1 must happen,” C1 is True.
- If instead Rule B was intended as a non‑immediate eventuality (event1 must occur at some unspecified future time), then C1 would not be guaranteed (it might be true or false depending on whether intermediate events are allowed). If you want a definitive logical answer, tell me which semantics you intend (immediate next-state obligation vs. eventuality).

Step 1 — events and initial condition

- Rule B: Whenever event2 happens in a state, event1 must happen in the next state.
(Informally: event1 → next(event2); event2 → next(event1).)

Step 3 — meaning of sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (i.e. at time 1).
- If you introduce more: C2 could mean “event1 happens in the state after that” (time 2), C3 “event2 at time 3”, etc. — each Ci refers to the occurrence of one of the two events at a particular subsequent state.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Apply the rules starting from the initial condition: time 0: event1. By Rule A, time 1 must have event2. By Rule B, time 2 must have event1, and so on, producing an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- Therefore C1 (“event2 happens in the next state”) is True, given the stated rules and the initial fact that event1 happened.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — if event1 occurs, the system reaches a terminal state (no further events).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — if event2 occurs, the system reaches a terminal state (no further events).
- No other transitions are given, and nothing prevents event2 from having occurred initially.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some time (including possibly the current/initial time) at which event2 holds.
- (No C2, C3 etc. were provided in the problem statement; if you meant additional conditions, please supply them.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because event2 is true in the initial state, the statement ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied right away. The ""after ... no other events can happen"" rules only say the system is terminal after event2 (or event1); they do not prevent the initial occurrence of event2.
- Therefore C1 is True.

Note on semantics: This conclusion assumes ""eventually"" allows the current (initial) moment. If you require ""eventually"" to mean strictly in a strictly later state (not the current one), then since no events can occur after the initial state, event2 would not occur at a strictly later time and C1 would be False under that stricter reading. In standard temporal-logic usage, however, ""eventually"" includes the present, so C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is False (event2 does not happen in the next state), under the usual reading of the premises. Below are the steps you requested.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: Initially, event2 happened (so the starting state S0 is one where event2 has just occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes any state reached immediately after event1 terminal (no further events follow).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes any state reached immediately after event2 terminal as well (no further events follow).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This asserts that, from the initial state S0, the next state S1 contains an occurrence of event2.
- (There are no C2, C3 given; if you have other Ci statements, list them and I can interpret them similarly.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and conclusion?
- From (1) and (2) we know S0 is a state after event2. From the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" S0 is terminal: no events occur after it.
- C1 claims that event2 does occur in the next state S1. That would require an event (event2) to occur after event2, which contradicts the rule that no events follow event2.
- Therefore, under the standard interpretation that ""no other events can happen"" means no events at all occur after a terminal event, C1 is False.

Note on a possible ambiguity: if someone reads ""no other events can happen"" to mean ""no events other than event2 can happen"" (i.e., repetition of event2 is allowed), then C1 could be true. But the natural reading of ""no other events"" in these kinds of scenarios is that the state after event2 is terminal (no further events of any kind), so C1 is False. If you intended the weaker meaning (only different events prohibited), tell me and I’ll re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Justification: the initial state is already after event2, and the premise ""after event2, no other events can happen"" makes that state terminal, so event2 cannot occur in the next state. (If ""no other events"" were meant to allow repeating event2, the answer would differ.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in the initial/actual execution trace event2 has occurred.

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is terminal: once it occurs, the execution stops (no further events).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Similarly, event1 is terminal.
- Combining these, any trace that contains event1 or event2 ends at that event. Given the initial condition, the actual trace is: event2 occurs, then nothing else.

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is stated as ""Event2 always happens.""
- This can be read in two ways (the phrase is ambiguous):
  a) ""Event2 occurs in every possible execution/trace"" (i.e., event2 happens at least once in all runs).
  b) ""At every time point (globally) event2 holds"" (i.e., event2 holds at all times, a much stronger claim).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C1
- Because the problem explicitly states ""Initially, event2 happened,"" every actual execution that respects the given initial condition contains event2 (and then stops). So under interpretation (a) — ""event2 occurs in every execution"" — C1 is True.
- Under interpretation (b) — ""event2 holds at every time point"" — that is generally False: event2 happened at the initial moment but does not continuously occur at all later times (and after it happens no other events occur, so it is not true that every moment is an occurrence of event2).

Final answer
- If C1 means ""event2 occurs in every possible run (at least once),"" then C1 is True.
- If C1 means ""event2 holds at all times (globally),"" then C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: the initial condition requires event2 to have happened, so every execution/trace contains event2. Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., occurs in every run) is True."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state, event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. if event2 holds now, then event1 holds in the next state).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. if event1 holds now, then event2 holds in the next state).

(Interpreting “after” as the immediately following state and “must” as a logical necessity.)

Step 3 — meaning of sub-conditions
- C1 (given): “Event1 happens in the next state.” (That is, X event1 where X is the next-state operator.)
- If helpful, define C2 analogously: “Event2 happens in the next state after event1,” i.e. X event2 when event1 holds now.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition we have event2 in the current state.
- By Rule A (after event2 → event1 next), that implies event1 holds in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is True.

(Also note: once event1 holds in that next state, Rule B would force event2 in the following state, producing an alternating pattern. There is no contradiction under the stated interpretation.)

Step 1 — what events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it holds at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (If event2 occurs, nothing can occur afterward.)
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (If event1 occurs, nothing can occur afterward.)
Given event1 already happened initially, those rules imply no further events can occur after that initial event1 (in particular, event2 cannot occur later).

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is written as ""Event1 happens and event1 happens.""
There are two reasonable readings:
a) Propositional reading: both conjuncts are the same atomic proposition ""event1 happens."" Then C1 is logically equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
b) Occurrence-counting reading: C1 intends two separate occurrences of event1 (i.e., event1 happens twice).

Step 4 — how they relate and final judgment
- Under the propositional reading (a): since the context states event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- Under the “two occurrences” reading (b): the rules say that after event1 no other events can happen, so a second occurrence of event1 cannot occur; therefore C1 would be false.

Most naturally (and in standard propositional logic) the conjunct is redundant and C1 is True. If you meant two distinct occurrences, then C1 is False.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules (what “after” means here):
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” → event1 is terminal: if event1 occurs, no later events can occur.
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” → event2 is terminal: if event2 occurs, no later events can occur.

3) What C1 means:
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — i.e., at no time does event1 occur.

4) How the pieces relate and conclusion:
- Since event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal, no events can occur after that point. There is no information that event1 occurred before that initial moment, and the statement “Initially, event2 happened” implies the history starts with event2. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time in the scenario as described. So C1 is true.

Note on ambiguity: If you allow simultaneous occurrences at the initial moment (both event1 and event2 happening together), or if “initially” doesn’t exclude prior events, the answer could differ. Under the usual reading (events occur in time, event2 occurs initially and stops further events), C1 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurs initially and is terminal (no events can occur after it), so event1 never occurs."

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, event2 follows.)
These force an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → …, and since event1 happened initially, event1 will occur now and repeatedly later.

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is P → P where P is “event1 happens.”

4) How conditions relate and verdict
- P → P is a logical tautology (always true): an implication with identical antecedent and consequent cannot be false.
- Given the scenario, event1 does occur (initially and repeatedly), so the antecedent can be true, and the consequent is the same statement, so it is true as well.
- Therefore C1 is True.

Note: If you intended a different condition (for example, “after event1, event1 must happen” meaning event1 must immediately follow itself), that would be a different claim and is not what C1 as written states.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the start, event2 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 is written as “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This is a redundant disjunction; it is logically equivalent to simply “event2 happens.” (Assuming “Event2” and “event2” refer to the same event.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because the initial condition states that event2 happened, the proposition “event2 happens” is true.
- Therefore the disjunction in C1 is true (true ∨ true = true; or true ∨ true = true even if repeated).
- So C1 is True.

(If “Event2” and “event2” were intended to be different symbols, say two distinct events, you would need their truth values; with the given initial condition that event2 happened, C1 would still be true if at least one of them is the same as the happened event.)

Answer: C1 is True (Event2 does not happen), under the usual temporal reading. Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition/temporal rules?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (No events occur at any time after event1.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, it requires that event1 occur afterward.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 (given): Event2 does not happen.
- (If needed) C2 could be read as ""event1 happens"" (the initial fact).
- (If needed) C3 could be read as ""no events happen after event1"" (Rule A).
- (If needed) C4 could be read as ""if event2 happens then event1 happens afterward"" (Rule B).

4) How do these conditions relate and why C1 is True:
- Because event1 already happened initially, Rule A forbids any events after that time. Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? Under the usual interpretation ""initially event1 happened"" fixes the initial state (there are no earlier events), so event2 could not have happened before.
- Thus there is no time at which event2 can occur without violating Rule A or contradicting the initial condition. So C1 (event2 does not happen) must be true.

Note on ambiguity: If you intended a different temporal reading (for example, “after event1, no event can happen immediately next, but later events are allowed,” or if events can repeat), the conclusion could change. Under the plain reading given above, C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: initially event2 happened (so in the described scenario event2 has occurred at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Formally: event2 ⇒ eventually event1.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1 states: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Formally: event1 ⇒ event2, i.e. every occurrence of event1 is preceded by or accompanied by an occurrence of event2.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion about C1
- From the rules we know event2 ⇒ event1. That gives the direction event2 → event1, but it does not give the reverse implication event1 → event2.
- Nothing in the rules forbids event1 from occurring without a prior event2, so C1 is not logically entailed by the rules alone.
- However, in the specific scenario described (where initially event2 did happen), the actual run will have event2 then event1 — so in that particular run any occurrence of event1 is indeed preceded by event2, i.e. C1 holds in that run.

Answer to the question
- As a logical consequence of the given rules: C1 is not guaranteed (False — not entailed).
- In the specific initial scenario you described (initially event2 happened): C1 is true for that actual execution/trace.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start (time 0).

2) Transition/obridation rules
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (at some later time).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (at some later time).

(“After X, Y must happen” I read as: whenever X occurs, there will be a later occurrence of Y.)

3) What the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (i.e. there exists some time at which event1 occurs — in temporal logic F(event1).)
- If you also consider C2, it would naturally be “event2 eventually happens” (not given by you, but useful symmetry).

4) How the conditions relate and why C1 is true
- The initial condition already satisfies C1 immediately: event1 happened at time 0, so “event1 eventually happens” is true.
- Even if you interpret “eventually” to mean “at some strictly later time than now,” the rules force a repeat: initial event1 ⇒ by Rule B there must be a later event2 ⇒ by Rule A there must be a later event1 again. So event1 will occur again in the future. Thus C1 holds under either interpretation.
- There is no scenario consistent with the given statements where event1 never happens: it already did, and the rules ensure an ongoing alternation (event1 → event2 → event1 → …) if the system obeys the rules.

Assumptions made: the “must happen” rules are guarantees (not merely desired properties that can be violated), and time progresses so “later” occurrences are possible. Under those reasonable assumptions, C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 already occurred at the start, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied. If ""eventually"" requires a strictly later occurrence, Rule B forces a later event2 and Rule A then forces a later event1, so a future occurrence of event1 is guaranteed."

- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event2 has already happened initially, and because rule A forbids any other events after event2, no event that would occur after that initial event2 can happen. In particular, event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- Therefore, under the standard interpretation that ""initially event2 happened"" places event2 at the start and that ""after"" means strictly later in time, event1 cannot happen at any later time. Hence C1 is true (entailed).

Ambiguity note: If you allow events to occur simultaneously or allow that event1 might have occurred at the same instant as event2 when you say ""initially event2 happened,"" then event1 could possibly also have happened at that same instant and C1 would be not strictly entailed. Under that less common reading the truth of C1 is indeterminate. But with the usual temporal reading (no simultaneous occurrences, ""after"" = strictly later), C1 is True.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is given as a fact at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event2 -> event1 (whenever event2 occurs, event1 has occurred).

4) How the conditions relate
- Because event1 is stated to have happened initially (a global fact), event1 is true in every allowed scenario. In propositional/first-order logic, any implication whose consequent is always true is itself true. Therefore event2 -> event1 holds: whenever event2 occurs (and it will, because event1 occurred and forces it), event1 is already true.
- (Side note: if we did not have the explicit initial fact ""event1 happened"", the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" alone would not suffice to infer event2 -> event1. But with the given initial condition, C1 is entailed.)

So C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial moment).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — read as: if event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterwards (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — read as: if event1 occurs then event2 must occur afterwards (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).

(Here I treat ""must happen"" as a liveness implication: occurrence of one event forces the eventual occurrence of the other.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — i.e., there exists some future time at which event2 occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- We have event1 true initially.
- By Rule B (event1 ⇒ eventually event2), from the initial event1 we conclude event2 must eventually occur.
- Therefore C1 is True.

(As a consequence, once event2 occurs Rule A forces event1 again, and so on — the rules imply an alternating recurrence of the two events. If you meant a different semantics for ""after"" or ""must happen"" please say so; under the usual temporal-reading above C1 is definitely true.)

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" is the implication event1 → event1.
- In propositional logic any formula of the form A → A is a tautology (always true).

4) How the condition relates to the context
- Independently of the transition rules, event1 → event1 is always true.
- In this specific context it is also true because event1 in fact happened (antecedent true and consequent true).

Conclusion: C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is False under the natural reading of the premises.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events (natural reading)
- Rule A: If event1 happens in some state, then event2 must happen in the immediately following state.
- Rule B: If event2 happens in some state, then no events can happen afterwards (i.e., in subsequent states there are no events).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e., event2 holds in the state immediately following the initial state (call that s1).

4) How they relate and final inference
- From the initial condition, event2 happened in s0.
- By Rule B, once event2 has happened (in s0), no events can happen in later states — in particular, s1 cannot contain any events.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in s1. So C1 is false.

Remark on ambiguity: If one instead allowed event2 to repeat after itself or interpreted ""no other events"" as ""no events except possibly event2,"" the conclusion could differ. But under the standard reading that event2 is terminal (no events at all after it), C1 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has just happened (we are in the state immediately after event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (If event1 occurs, the system goes to a terminal state with no further events.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (From a state after event2, event1 is required to occur next.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., immediately after the current state.)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- We are currently in the state after event2. Rule B requires event1 to occur after event2. Interpreting ""must happen"" as an immediate next-step requirement, event1 must occur in the next state. Rule A only says that after that event1 occurs no further events can happen, which does not conflict with C1.
- Therefore, under the usual reading that ""must happen"" means next-state obligation, C1 is True.

Caveat: if ""after event2, event1 must happen"" were intended only as an eventuality (sometime later rather than necessarily in the immediate next state), then C1 could be indeterminate. Under the standard next-state interpretation, C1 = True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Because we're in the state immediately after event2 and Rule B requires event1 to occur next (and Rule A only stops events after event1, not before), C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened (call that the current state S0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. in the next state after event2, event1 occurs).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. in the next state after event1, event2 occurs).

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Interpreting “next state” as the immediate successor state after the current/initial state S0.

(You mentioned C2, C3 etc. but did not define them. If needed, a natural interpretation would be C2 = “Event2 happens in the next state after event1,” etc.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since the initial state S0 has event2, and Rule A says that after event2 event1 must happen, the immediate next state S1 must contain event1.
- Therefore C1 (event1 happens in the next state) is True under the given premises.

Note: This conclusion assumes the rules are deterministic/mandatory (i.e., “must happen” means it will indeed occur). If “must” were only a preference or could be blocked by other constraints, the answer could change.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Yes — given S0 has event2 and Rule A mandates event1 in the immediate next state, C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred (at time t0).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 occurs at some time t, then event2 must occur at some later time t' > t.
- If event2 occurs at some time t, then event1 must occur at some later time t' > t.
(So occurrence of one forces a later occurrence of the other; they alternate.)

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Interpreting ""happens"" as “occurs at some point in the timeline (past, present or future)”.

4) How the conditions relate and final inference
- From the initial condition, event2 has already happened, so the disjunction ""event1 or event2"" is already satisfied. Therefore C1 is true.
- Also, by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur later as well, so both event1 and event2 will (in fact) occur. That only reinforces that C1 is true.

Note on interpretation: If you meant ""happens"" to mean ""happens at a specific instant or in the next step,"" please say which instant; the conclusion above assumes the usual temporal reading (“occurs at some time”), under which C1 is unequivocally true.

Short answer: C1 is True (entailed), assuming the usual inclusive ""or"". Explanation step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Interpreting ""or"" as the standard inclusive logical OR: C1 is true if at least one of event1 or event2 happens. (If you meant exclusive OR, note that would require exactly one of them to happen.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- The initial condition already guarantees event1 happened, so the disjunction is already satisfied.
- The transition rule also guarantees event2 will happen later, so in fact both disjuncts hold.
- Therefore, under the given assumptions, C1 is true. (If you intended XOR instead of OR, C1 would be false because both events occur.)

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” That makes any state reached after event1 terminal (no further events occur).
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” Likewise, event2 would also be terminal if it ever happened.
- Because event1 already happened initially, the “after event1” rule already applies immediately.

3) What C1 means
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” is a claim that, in the successor state following the initial state, event1 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since event1 already happened in the initial state and the rule “after event1, no other events can happen” prohibits any subsequent events, the next state cannot have any events (including another occurrence of event1). Therefore C1 is false under the natural reading.
- (Caveat) If you intended a different semantics — e.g. “happened” only marks a past occurrence but events may reoccur, or “next state” refers to the initial state itself — then the answer could differ. Under the usual interpretation above, C1 is False.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start / at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal — once it occurs, the run ends / no further events occur.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 is required to occur later.)

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — i.e., at some point after the start, event1 occurs (F event1 in temporal logic terms).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since event2 has already occurred initially and Rule B requires that whenever event2 occurs event1 must occur later, it follows that event1 must occur at some later time. Rule A (that nothing follows event1) does not prevent event1 from occurring; it only forbids events after event1. Therefore C1 (event1 eventually happens) is satisfied.

So C1 is True. (If you intended a different reading of “must happen” or “after” — e.g., insisting on immediate next-step vs. eventual — please say so, but under the usual reading “after… must happen” means eventual occurrence, and the conclusion still holds.)

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start / at some time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 occurs, event2 will occur sometime afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; nothing occurs after it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a logical disjunction: C1 is true iff at least one of event1 or event2 occurs (at some time).
- (No C2, C3 etc. were provided; if you have others, give them and I can interpret them similarly.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Given the initial fact that event1 happened, the disjunction in C1 is immediately satisfied (event1 is true), so C1 is true.
- Moreover, because event1 implies event2 must happen, event2 will also occur later; so in fact both disjuncts become true. The ""after event2 no other events"" rule doesn't prevent either event1 or event2 from occurring, it only forbids anything after event2.

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, event2 will (or is required to) occur at some later point.
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes event2 a terminal event but places no restriction preventing event2 from occurring.

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This asserts that even though event1 happened, event2 never occurs.

4) How they relate
- Given the initial condition (event1 happened) together with Rule A (event2 must happen after event1), the assertion that event2 does not happen contradicts the rules and initial condition. Rule B does not prevent event2; it only states what happens after event2. Therefore C1 is inconsistent with the premises.

Conclusion: C1 is False (it contradicts ""After event1, event2 must happen""). 

(If you intended a different reading of ""must""—for example as a recommendation rather than a guaranteed outcome—state that and I can re-evaluate.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur later.
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur later.
(“After” = at some later time; “must happen” = the system will produce the required event at some later time.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” That means there exists some time (either now or in the future) at which event1 occurs.

4) How do these relate and does C1 hold?
- Because event1 has already happened initially, C1 is satisfied immediately if “eventually” allows the initial occurrence.
- Even if “eventually” is interpreted as “at some strictly future time,” the transition rules force an alternating sequence: initial event1 → (by Rule B) event2 later → (by Rule A) event1 later → … So event1 will occur again in the future.
- Therefore under the natural reading of the rules, C1 is true (both by the initial occurrence and by the forced recurrence).

Conclusion: C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Justification: event1 has already occurred initially, so ""eventually happens"" is satisfied. Even if ""eventually"" meant a strictly later time, Rule B then forces event2 and Rule A forces event1 again, so event1 will recur."

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs then event1 will occur afterwards.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal — no further events follow it.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is p → p (with p = “event1 happens”).
- In classical propositional logic p → p is a tautology (always true). You can see this by truth table or by the simple inference that from p you can conclude p.

4) How the context affects C1
- None of the given initial condition or transition rules can make p → p false. Whether event1 actually occurs or not, p → p evaluates true (if p true, then p is true; if p false, implication is true by definition).
- Restrictions like ""after event1 no other events can happen"" or ""after event2 event1 must happen"" do not change the trivial truth of p → p.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen.""
- ""After event1, no other events can happen.""
These rules make any state in which event1 or event2 has occurred a terminal state with respect to other events.

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows for C1?
- Since event2 already happened in the initial state and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" prevents additional events from occurring after that point, the next state cannot be a state in which an event occurs. Under the natural reading that events are one-off and no events occur after a terminal event, event2 does not (and cannot) ""happen"" in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.

Note on ambiguity: If one allowed the same event to re-occur and interpreted ""no other events"" as only forbidding different events, then in principle event2 might occur again and C1 could be true. But the usual reading of the given rules (terminal events) makes C1 false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event2 has already occurred in the initial state and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot happen again in the next state under the usual (one-off, terminal) reading. (Only if you allowed re-occurrence of the same event would C1 be possibly true.)"

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (That is: whenever event2 has occurred, event1 will occur at some later time.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 occurs the system reaches a terminal situation with respect to these events.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There exists some future time at which event1 occurs.)
- (No C2/C3 were given in the problem; if there were, you can define them similarly.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial condition (event2 happened) and Rule A, event1 must occur at some later time. That directly implies C1.
- Rule B does not prevent event1 from occurring; it only restricts what can happen after event1. It is compatible with Rule A.
- Therefore the sequence consistent with all statements is: event2 (initial) → event1 (sometime after) → no further events.

Stepwise analysis

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: initially event2 happened. (This is the starting fact about the history.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" If event1 occurs at some time, then at some later time event2 must occur.
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards (event2 is terminal).

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" It asserts that event1 never occurs at any time in the history being considered.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- Because event2 happens initially, rule B (no events after event2) means no events can occur after that initial event2. So event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial event2.
- Could event1 have occurred before that initial event2? The phrase ""initially, event2 happened"" is normally read as the starting point of the history (there are no earlier events). Under that standard reading there is no earlier time at which event1 could have happened, so event1 does not happen at all.
- Even if one tried to allow events before the ""initial"" point, that would contradict the usual meaning of ""initially."" If one nonetheless allowed a pre-initial history, then event1 could have occurred earlier and rule A would be satisfied by the initial event2. But that is not the natural reading.

Conclusion
- Under the natural interpretation of the premises (the history starts with event2 and no events occur afterward), C1 is True: event1 does not happen.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurs at the initial point and, by the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no events can occur afterward. With ""initially"" taken as the start of the history (no earlier events), event1 cannot have occurred before, so event1 does not happen."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0) event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.
(“After” can be read in two natural ways — see Step 4 for how the reading matters.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1 (given): “Event1 happens in the next state.” (i.e. in the immediate successor of the initial state.)
- No C2/C3 were specified in the problem statement, so nothing else to interpret.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion about C1
- If “after” means “immediately in the next state”: From the initial state we have event2 at state 0, and Rule B requires event1 in the next state (state 1). Therefore C1 is True.
- If “after” means “eventually sometime later (not necessarily the immediate next state)”: Rule B only requires that event1 occur at some future state, not necessarily the immediate next one. In that reading C1 (event1 in the next state) is not guaranteed — it might be true but is not entailed by the premises (so the truth of C1 would be Unknown/indeterminate).

Short answer
- Under the usual next-state interpretation of “after”: C1 is True.
- Under an “eventually” interpretation: C1 is not guaranteed (Unknown).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event2 has happened (so s0 is a state ""after event2"").

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means: from any state where event2 has occurred, there are no future transitions labeled with any event (neither event1 nor another event2). The state is terminal with respect to events.
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That means: if event1 happens in some state, then event2 must occur afterwards (at least at some next point). (This rule is irrelevant if event1 never happens.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Interpreting ""next state"" as the immediate successor of the initial state s0 (call it s1), C1 asserts that event2 occurs in s1.
(There are no other C2, C3 given; only C1 is under consideration.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since s0 already has event2, Rule A applies: from s0 no events can happen in any successor state. In particular, no event2 can occur in the next state s1.
- Rule B (after event1 → event2) does not force anything here because event1 cannot occur after s0 (Rule A forbids any events after event2), so it doesn't create a path that produces event2 later.
- Therefore C1 (that event2 happens in the next state) is false under the given statements: after event2 nothing can happen, so event2 cannot happen in the next state.

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (So as soon as event1 has occurred, event2 will occur subsequently.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur subsequently.)
These rules produce a cycle: event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

3) Meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (asserts that event2 never occurs.)

4) Relation of conditions and conclusion
- From the initial event1 and Rule A, event2 must occur at least once after the initial event1. Therefore the claim that event2 does not happen contradicts the given facts and rules.
- Hence C1 is false.

(If instead ""must"" were interpreted non‑strictly as a mere obligation that could be violated, you could not deduce certainty; but under the usual reading of transition rules as inevitabilities, C1 is false.)

Short answer: C1 is False (given the usual reading). Explanation step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes any state that comes after a state where event2 occurred a terminal state with no further events.
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (Not used here because event1 does not occur in the initial state.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state.

4) How they relate and the conclusion
- The initial state already has event2. By Rule A, once event2 has occurred, no events can occur in any subsequent state. Therefore the next state cannot contain event2 (nor any other event). So C1 is false.

Note on ambiguity: If one interprets ""no other events can happen"" as meaning ""no events other than event2 can happen"" and allows event2 to reoccur, then C1 could, in principle, be true. Under the natural reading that event2 makes the system terminal (no further events at all), C1 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After (whenever) event1 happens, event2 must happen next.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen next.
So the system forces an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → …

Step 3 — what the subcondition C1 means
- C1 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""
There are two natural readings:
  - Logical (material implication): A → A. This is a tautology (always true).
  - Temporal/causal: “If event1 happens now, then (at some later time) event1 happens.” Under the given transition rules, this is also true: event1 implies event2 next, and after that event1 occurs again, so event1 will recur.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Given the initial event1 and the mandatory alternation rules, event1 does indeed recur indefinitely.
- Under either the logical or the temporal reading, C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: As a logical (material) implication A → A is a tautology. Under the temporal/causal reading, the rules force an alternating sequence event1 → event2 → event1, so whenever event1 occurs it will occur again, making the statement true."

Short answer: C1 is False. Event1 must occur (indeed repeatedly). Explanation step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 is required).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, a subsequent event1 is required).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Interpreted as “event1 never occurs” (or at least it does not occur after the initial condition).

4) How do these relate and what follows?
- At t0 we have event2 (given).
- By Rule B (after event2, event1 must happen) there must be a later time t1 > t0 at which event1 occurs. So event1 does happen.
- Once event1 occurs at t1, by Rule A there must be a later time t2 > t1 at which event2 occurs, and so on. The rules force an alternating sequence: event2 (given), event1, event2, event1, ….
- Therefore the statement “event1 does not happen” is false.

Possible caveat: if “must happen” were interpreted as something else (e.g., a soft preference) or if no future is allowed, conclusions could differ. Under the usual logical/temporal reading above, C1 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (call that state S0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen.
I read “after” here as a requirement on the immediately following state (if you mean “eventually” instead, see the note below).

Formally (next-state interpretation):
- If event2 occurs in state S_k then event1 occurs in state S_{k+1}.
- If event1 occurs in state S_k then event2 occurs in state S_{k+1}.

3) What C1 (and other sub-conditions) mean
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” means event1 occurs in S1 (the state immediately after S0).
- (If there were C2, C3 they would be similar statements about events in particular states; only C1 is given here.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From S0: event2 happened.
- Apply Rule A: since event2 holds in S0, event1 must hold in S1.
- Therefore C1 is True under the “next-state” reading.

Note on ambiguity: if “after” was intended to mean “at some time later (eventually)” rather than “in the next state,” then C1 is not guaranteed (event1 could occur later than the immediate next state). Under the usual immediate-next-state reading, C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: In the next-state reading, S0 has event2, and Rule A requires event1 in S1, so C1 (event1 in the next state) holds."

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. event1 is true in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — event1 is a terminal (absorbing) event: once it occurs nothing else can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — event2 is also a terminal event.
- Given event1 happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur after that.

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- The only sub-condition given is C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" That is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (P ∨ P ≡ P). No other C2, C3 are provided.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since the initial fact asserts event1 happened, the proposition Event1 is true.
- C1 is exactly Event1 (or its duplicate), so C1 is true.
- The terminal rules just confirm no other events can follow, but they do not change the truth of C1.

Therefore C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens,"" which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens,"" and the context states event1 happened initially."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e. event2 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 implies event1 happens subsequently).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to just ""event2"" (p ∨ p ≡ p).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Because the context states event2 happened initially, the proposition ""event2"" is true.
- Therefore C1 (which is equivalent to event2) is True.
- The other transition rules (that event1 must follow and then nothing else can happen) do not change the truth of C1.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e. whenever event1 happens there is a later time at which event2 happens).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. whenever event2 happens there is a later time at which event1 happens).

(Formally: G(event1 -> F event2) and G(event2 -> F event1) in temporal logic.)

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is a disjunction stating that at least one of the two events occurs. (There is a minor ambiguity: it can be read as “event1 or event2 happens at some time” (existential), or as “at every time either event1 or event2 holds” (universal). The natural reading here is existential: that one of the events occurs.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since event2 has already happened initially, the disjunction in C1 is already satisfied.  
- Moreover, given the transition rules, from the initial event2 we must have a later event1, then a later event2, and so on. So both events will occur (indeed infinitely often under the given “must happen” liveness interpretation).

Conclusion about C1:
- Under the usual reading (some occurrence happens), C1 is True (event2 already happened).  
- If C1 were read as “always (event2 or event1) holds at every moment,” that would typically be False because between instantaneous events neither may hold.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (Every occurrence of event1 is followed by an occurrence of event2.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (Every occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1.)
- Together these rules force an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- Interpreting this as a temporal implication (“whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur” — typically meaning at some time after it, or simply that an occurrence of event2 implies an occurrence of event1 follows), Rule B directly asserts that implication.
- Even under the natural reading “every event2 is followed by an event1,” the system guarantees that.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate
- Rule B entails C1 directly. Combined with Rule A you get mutual alternation, so both “if event1 happens then event2 happens” and “if event2 happens then event1 happens” hold.
- The initial event1 just starts the alternating pattern; it does not contradict C1.

Conclusion
- C1 is True (it follows from the rule “after event2, event1 must happen”).

Short answer: C1 is True — given the usual reading that ""after X, Y must happen"" means ""in the immediate next state after X, Y holds.""

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state S0, event1 happened (event1 is true at S0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. Read as: if event2 is true at state n, then event1 must be true at state n+1.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. Read as: if event1 is true at state n, then event2 must be true at state n+1.
(Assumption: ""after"" = immediate next state; ""must happen"" = obligatorily true in that next state.)

3) Meaning of sub-conditions
- C1 (given): ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e., event2 is true at S1 (the state immediately following S0).
- (If you have other Ci’s in mind, please give them; with the rules above you can interpret each Ci as a predicate about events at a particular next state.)

4) How the conditions relate and final inference
- At S0: event1 is true (given).
- By Rule B (after event1, event2 must happen), event2 must be true at S1.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is satisfied. So C1 is True.
- Continuing: from S1 (event2 true) Rule A forces event1 true at S2, so the system alternates event1, event2, event1, ...

Note on semantics: if you intended ""after"" to mean ""eventually at some future state"" rather than ""immediately next,"" the immediate-next conclusion still generally follows here (event1 at S0 requires event2 at some future state; but without the immediacy assumption C1 may be weaker or require extra assumptions).

Short answer: C1 is True (under the usual meaning of “eventually” that allows the event to hold now). I’ll justify step by step and mention the edge case.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (it holds at the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” That means there exists some point in the execution (now or in the future) at which event2 holds. (If you instead mean “strictly in the future, after the current moment,” see the note at the end.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because the initial state already has event2, the statement “event2 eventually happens” is immediately satisfied: there exists a time (the initial time) at which event2 holds.
- The other rules do not contradict this. Rule A only restricts what can happen after event2 (no further events); Rule B says that if event1 ever happened it would force event2 afterward — but given event2 already happened and is terminal, event1 cannot occur after that. That makes event1 impossible in the actual execution, but it does not affect C1.

Conclusion:
- C1 is True under the standard interpretation that “eventually” allows the current (initial) state to satisfy the property.

Edge case / alternative reading:
- If by “eventually” you require event2 to occur strictly after the current moment (a future occurrence, not including now), then C1 would be False because rule A prevents any events (including another occurrence of event2) after the initial event2.

Short answer: C1 is False (with a note about a possible ambiguous reading explained below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1 states: “Event2 happens in the next state.” That asks whether, immediately after the initial state, event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened in the initial state and the rule “after event2, no other events can happen” makes event2 terminal, there is no subsequent state in which an event (including event2) occurs. Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen in the next state.
- Conclusion: C1 is False.

Note on ambiguity: if one read “no other events can happen” to mean “no events different from the one that just happened” and allowed repeated occurrences of the same event, then one could argue event2 could occur again and C1 might be True. However, the natural reading of the premises is that both event1 and event2 are terminal (no further events follow), so C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 has already happened in the initial state and is terminal (""after event2, no other events can happen""), so it cannot occur in the next state. (If one allowed repeated occurrences of the same event, the reading would be ambiguous, but under the natural terminal reading the answer is False.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 follows event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 follows event2).
- Together these rules force an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (at least one occurrence of each after the other).

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is the statement ""Event1 happens or Event1 happens.""
- Logically, (A or A) is equivalent to A. So C1 simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- Since event1 happened initially, the simplified statement ""Event1 happens"" is true (it is true at the initial time, and by the transition rules event1 will occur repeatedly afterward).
- Note: C1 is not a logical tautology (it does not hold for all possible worlds) — it is simply redundant (A ∨ A = A). Its truth here follows from the fact that event1 actually occurs.

Short answer: C1 is True (under the standard meaning of ""eventually"" that allows the current/initial time). Below is the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and the initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state (so event1 is true now).

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Interpretation: once event2 occurs the system reaches a terminal state — no further events occur after that point.
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Interpretation: if event1 occurs (now or at some time), then at some later time event2 must occur (an obligation that event2 will occur after event1).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1 (given): ""Event1 eventually happens."" This means there exists a time (now or later) at which event1 holds.
- (For completeness) C2 could be taken as ""Event2 eventually happens."" C3 could be ""After event1, eventually event2 happens."" But only C1 was given explicitly.

4) How the conditions relate and final verdict
- Because the initial condition states event1 already happened in the initial state, the property ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied immediately. So C1 is true.
- Consequence chain: from event1 (initial) and Rule B, event2 must occur later; when event2 occurs Rule A makes the run terminal. That does not affect C1 being true (it already held).

Note on interpretation edge-case
- If by ""eventually"" you mean ""at some strictly future time after now"" (i.e., excluding the current/initial time), then C1 would depend on whether event1 occurs again later. Under the usual temporal-logic convention that ""eventually"" includes the current state, C1 is true.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. event2 ⇒ event1 in the next/required state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. event1 ⇒ event2 in the next/required state).
- These rules produce an alternating sequence starting from the initial event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1 is the formula ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is p ⇒ p (antecedent and consequent identical).
- In propositional logic p ⇒ p is a tautology (always true). It is true regardless of whether p actually occurs.

4) How do the conditions relate?
- The transition rules ensure event1 does occur repeatedly in this scenario, but that fact is not needed to evaluate C1.
- As written, C1 is trivially/tautologically true. If you instead meant ""If event1 happens now, then event1 happens later"" or ""event1 will happen again,"" that is a different (nontrivial) statement and would require interpreting temporal scope; given the alternation, that stronger temporal claim would also be true here (event1 at time t implies event1 at time t+2, etc.). But plain p ⇒ p is always true.

So final: C1 is True.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 has occurred, event2 will occur subsequently).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur subsequently).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some future point (possibly immediately next) at which event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition (event1 has happened) and Rule A (""after event1, event2 must happen""), event2 is guaranteed to occur after that initial event1. Therefore C1 is satisfied.
- In fact, with Rule B as well, the system cycles: event1 → event2 → event1 → …, so event2 not only happens once but recurs indefinitely.

So C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e., at the start/time 0 event2 occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 is followed at some later point by event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed at some later point by event1).
(Starting from the initial event2 this forces an alternating sequence event2 → event1 → event2 → …, but that detail isn’t needed for C1.)

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is A → A (with A = “event1 happens”).

4) How these relate / final verdict
- A → A is a logical tautology (reflexivity of implication): it is true in every model, regardless of the transition rules or initial condition. Therefore C1 is true (it is entailed by the context).

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- From event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is p → p (where p = ""event1 happens"").

4) How conditions relate and conclusion
- p → p is a logical tautology: it is true in every possible situation (even when p is false, the implication is true; when p is true, the implication is trivially true).
- In the given scenario the antecedent p is actually true (because event2 happened and forces event1), so the implication is true on those grounds as well.
- Therefore C1 is True (both as a logical tautology and in this specific model).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initially) event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen at some later point.

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is the statement “Event2 eventually happens.”
- Note a standard reading of “eventually” in temporal logic (F p) is “there exists a time t ≥ now when p holds” (this includes the current state). If you instead mean “strictly in the future” (t > now), that is a different reading.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C1
- Given the initial condition, event2 already happened at time 0. So under the usual “eventually” semantics that allows the present (t ≥ now), C1 is True.
- Under the stricter interpretation “event2 will happen at some time strictly after now,” there is no rule that forces another event2 after the initial one: rule B forces event1 to occur after the initial event2, and rule A then prevents any further events after event1. Therefore under the “strict future” reading, no further event2 is guaranteed, so C1 (interpreted as “will happen later”) would be False.

Conclusion
- With the common temporal-logic interpretation (eventually = at or after now): C1 is True (event2 has already happened).
- If you meant “event2 will occur strictly in the future”: C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Justification: event2 has already happened initially, and under the standard ""eventually"" (exists t ≥ now) reading that makes the statement true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the current (initial) state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
(Interpreting ""after"" as applying to the immediately following state → the rules force alternation between event1 and event2.)

Step 3 — what the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (No C2/C3 were provided; if there are others, they were not specified.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Given the initial state has event2 and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” the next state must have event1.
- Therefore C1 is True.

(If instead “after” were intended to mean “eventually after” rather than the immediate next state, the conclusion that event1 will occur at some future state still holds; the only caveat would be if other rules or events could prevent these mandatory transitions, which were not given here.)

Short answer: True — if “Event2 always happens” means “Event2 occurs in every possible execution (trace)”. If you mean “Event2 holds at every time point” then that stronger reading is false. Below is the step-by-step breakdown.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start (every execution begins with event2).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, it is followed by event2.)

3) What the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Two possible readings:
  - Reading 1 (existential-per-trace): In every execution trace, event2 occurs at least once. 
  - Reading 2 (invariant): At every time point / in every state, event2 holds (i.e., it is always true forever).
- (No C2, C3 were given in the problem statement.)

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 happens initially and event2 is terminal, no other events can occur after that initial event2. That rules out any later occurrence of event1.
- Rule B (“after event1, event2 must happen”) is therefore irrelevant in practice here — it is vacuously satisfied because event1 never occurs in any execution.
- Therefore under Reading 1 (the usual interpretation for “always happens” meaning “happens in every run”), C1 is True: every execution contains event2 (it occurs at the start).
- Under Reading 2 (the stronger “holds at every time point”), C1 is False: event2 is an event occurrence at the initial time but does not hold at later times because no events occur afterwards.

Conclusion: C1 is true under the natural reading “event2 occurs in every execution,” but false under the stronger invariant reading.

Step-by-step:

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the start event2 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ event2 occurs later).

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is the statement “event1 happens OR event2 happens” (event1 ∨ event2).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Since event2 happened initially, the disjunction event1 ∨ event2 is satisfied regardless of event1. Therefore C1 is true.
- (Additional note: given the rules, event1 cannot occur after the initial event2 because no events can occur after event2; and under the usual reading of “initially” there are no earlier events, so event1 does not hold — but that doesn’t affect C1 because event2 already holds.)

Summary answer: C1 is False (under the most natural reading). Explanation below, step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it time 0) event2 happened (event2 is true at time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Meaning: if event1 holds at time t then event2 must hold at time t+1.
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Natural reading: if event2 holds at time t then at time t+1 no events occur (neither event1 nor event2). In other words, event2 at t blocks any events at t+1.

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" That is the claim that event2 is true at time 1 (the state immediately after the initial state).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and does C1 hold?
- The initial state has event2 at time 0.
- By Rule B, once event2 occurs at time 0, time 1 must have no events. Therefore event2 does not hold at time 1.
- Conclusion: C1 (""event2 at the next state"") is false.

Note on ambiguity: If one instead reads Rule B as “after event2, no other events can happen” meaning “no events other than event2 may occur after event2” (i.e., event2 could repeat but event1 cannot), then C1 could be true in some models (event2 could be allowed to hold again at time 1). But the standard plain reading of “no other events can happen” is that no events at all follow, and under that reading C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Since event2 occurs at the initial state and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids any events (including event2) in the next state, event2 does not hold at time 1."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means event2 is terminal: if event2 happens at some time, no further events occur after it.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means event1 is terminal as well: once event1 happens, no further events can occur after it.

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- You only gave C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a logical disjunction: C1 is true if at least one of event2 or event1 happens.
- (If there were C2, C3, etc., we would evaluate each the same way using the facts and rules.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal events. Because event1 happened initially and is terminal, no other events can occur after that point — in particular, event2 does not (and cannot) occur after the initial event1.
- That said, C1 is an OR of two possibilities; only one needs to be true for C1 to be true.

Conclusion about C1:
- C1 is True, because event1 happened. (Event2 does not need to happen for the disjunction to be true.)

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).
- Rule B: After event2 happens, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 must occur after it).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the ordinary implication: whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs (at some point required by the context).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Since event1 already happened initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time in any valid timeline.
- An implication ""if P then Q"" is true whenever P never holds (vacuously true). Therefore, because event2 cannot happen, C1 is true.
- Also, Rule B directly enforces that whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen; so even if one tried to allow event2, C1 would be satisfied. The combination of rules actually makes event2 impossible, but in all interpretations C1 holds.

(If you allow repeated occurrences of event1 or a different temporal reading of ""after,"" the conclusion could change; under the natural reading above, C1 is True.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 has already happened and Rule A forbids any events after it, so event2 cannot occur (making ""if event2 then event1"" vacuously true). Even ignoring that, Rule B directly requires event1 whenever event2 occurs, so the implication holds."

Short answer: True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. whenever event1 occurs, it is followed by event2).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly a conditional statement about what must follow event1.

4) How the conditions relate
- Rule B explicitly states the same conditional as C1, so C1 is directly entailed by the context.
- (Additional note) Given Rule A and the initial event2, event1 cannot actually occur in this scenario, so the implication would also be vacuously true. But you do not need that fact: Rule B alone makes C1 true.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So once either event occurs, the run stops; there are no further transitions.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted as “in every possible execution/run (given the specification) event1 occurs” (or equivalently, event1 occurs in the initial/actual run).

4) How do these relate?
- Because the initial condition already states event1 happened, every execution begins with event1 having occurred. And since event1 is terminal, no alternative events (like event2) can occur afterwards. Therefore in all executions under the given description event1 occurs.

Conclusion: C1 is True. (If by “always” you meant a different formal notion — e.g. “event1 happens at every moment” or “in every possible initial configuration” — state that interpretation and I’ll adjust the answer.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (i.e., at the start of the scenario event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
(Each event, if it occurs, is an absorbing/terminal event that stops any further events.)

Step 3 — what the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (No other sub-conditions were given.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after that point.
- If we take ""initially event2 happened"" to mean event2 is the starting/first event (i.e., there were no earlier events and no simultaneous events), then event1 did not and cannot happen in this scenario.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is True (entailed by the given facts).

Caveat: if one allows events to have occurred before the stated ""initial"" time or to occur simultaneously with the initial event, then the facts as given would not suffice to rule out event1 in those alternative interpretations. Under the usual reading that ""initially event2 happened"" means event2 is the first/starting event, C1 is True.

True

Reason: initially event2 has occurred and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids any further events, so event1 cannot occur."

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the implication event1 → event2.

4) How the conditions relate to C1
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" directly states event1 → event2, so C1 is explicitly true.
- (Additional note) Even if event1 can never actually occur in this scenario because event2 already happened and is terminal, the implication event1 → event2 is still true (either because it is explicitly required or vacuously true if event1 is impossible).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e. the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (if event1 occurs, then at some later time event2 occurs).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no other events can occur (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is written as ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" In standard logic this is the conjunction P ∧ P where P = “event2 happens.” P ∧ P is logically equivalent to P (it asserts the same single fact twice).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- From the initial condition we already have P true (event2 happened).
- Therefore P ∧ P is true. So, under the ordinary reading that C1 repeats the same proposition, C1 is True.
- Caveat (alternate reading): If the user intended C1 to mean “event2 happens at two distinct times” (i.e. two occurrences of event2), then that would conflict with Rule B: once event2 has occurred no further events (including another event2) can occur. Under that interpretation, C1 would be False.  

Conclusion: Under the usual logical reading (P ∧ P), C1 is True. If it was intended to assert two separate occurrences of event2, C1 would be False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is P ∧ P with P = ""event2 happens,"" which is equivalent to P; the initial condition states P is true. (If C1 instead meant two distinct occurrences of event2, it would be False because event2 is terminal.)"

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the start (or at some initial time) event2 is true/has occurred.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur after it.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So if event1 occurs, it also prevents any subsequent events.
- Together these mean both event1 and event2 are terminal: if either occurs, nothing else can occur afterward.

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- You only gave C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Logically this is (event2) ∧ (event2), which is equivalent to event2 (a redundant conjunction). It asserts that event2 has occurred.
- (If there were other Ci they would be individual propositions about events happening; evaluate similarly.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The initial condition already makes event2 true. The terminal rules do not contradict that: they only forbid any events after event2, they do not prevent event2 itself.
- Because event2 occurred initially, event1 cannot occur after that (since no events occur after event2). There is no information that event1 occurred before event2, so event1 is not implied.
- C1, being simply a restatement of ""event2 happened,"" is consistent with the context.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Formally: whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs later.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (Formally: whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs later.)
- Together these make the two events force each other to occur (they alternate), starting from the initial event1.

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1 is: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a plain material implication of the form p -> p.
- As a propositional implication, p -> p is a tautology (always true) for any proposition p.
- If one reads it temporally (e.g., ""if event2 happens then eventually event2 happens""), that is also trivially true: the occurrence of event2 now already guarantees that event2 has happened (or will have happened at the same moment), so the temporal reading holds as well.

4) How do the conditions relate to each other (and to C1)?
- From the initial event1 and Rule B, event2 will indeed occur at some later time; from event2 and Rule A, event1 will occur afterwards, and so on. So event2 does occur in the system described.
- But you do not need the transition rules at all to evaluate C1: the implication event2 -> event2 is valid in every model (tautological), so it is true regardless of whether event2 ever actually occurs.

4) How do these relate and why C1 is true?
- In propositional logic A → A is a tautology (always true), regardless of whether A is true or false.
- In the given scenario, event1 does in fact happen initially, so the antecedent is true and the consequent is true as well; the implication holds.
- Even without using the scenario, the implication is always true by logical form.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 has happened (at least once at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After E1 occurs, E2 must occur (at some later time).
- Rule B: After E2 occurs, E1 must occur (at some later time).

(I'm assuming these rules require the next occurrence but do not forbid repeating events or infinite alternation.)

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1 states: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Logically this is E2 ∧ E2, which is equivalent to E2 (or, interpreted temporally, that E2 occurs at least twice). Either interpretation reduces to: “E2 occurs.”

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the conclusion?
- Given initial E2 (true).
- By Rule B (after E2 → E1), E1 must occur subsequently.
- By Rule A (after E1 → E2), E2 must occur again subsequently.
- Therefore E2 happens (initially) and E2 happens again (later). So the conjunction in C1 is satisfied.

Conclusion: Under the given assumptions, C1 is True.

- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs, nothing else can occur later.)

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e., event2 never occurs at any time in the timeline.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event1 happened initially and Rule A forbids any other events after event1, there can be no later occurrence of event2.
- Event2 could not have happened before event1 because event1 is specified as the initial event.
- (If one allowed simultaneous/instantaneous co-occurrence, there would be an ambiguity; under the standard sequential reading “after” and “initially” imply event1 is first and exclusive, so simultaneity is not allowed.)

- C1 is stated as “Event2 always happens.” There are two plausible formal readings:
  1. (Existential/trace reading) In every possible execution (trace) of the system, event2 occurs at least once. — “event2 happens in all runs.”
  2. (Global/instantaneous reading) At every moment in time from now on, event2 is true (a global invariant G(event2)). — “event2 holds at all times.”

Step 4 — how the facts imply C1
- Because event2 has already happened initially, every possible execution/trace already contains event2 (at the start). Also, since event2 is terminal, no subsequent events can remove or replace that fact by producing further events that might contradict it.
- Therefore under reading (1) (event2 occurs in every run) C1 is True: event2 does occur in every possible execution (it happened initially).
- Under the stronger reading (2) (event2 holds at every future instant), the truth depends on whether “happened” is treated as a persistent proposition. If “happened” is persistent (once happened, the proposition remains true forever), then C1 is True. If “event2” denotes an instantaneous occurrence that is not true at times after the instant, then C1 (as a global invariant) would be False or at least ambiguous.

Final answer
- C1 is True under the usual reading that “event2 happens in every execution” (and also true under the global reading if “happened” is persistent). It is only problematic if you insist that “always” means “holds at every time instant” and instantaneous events are not persistent — in that narrow sense it is ambiguous/false.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at time t0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs at some time t, there exists a later time t' > t when event1 occurs).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 occurs at some time t, there exists a later time t' > t when event2 occurs).

3) What the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreted precisely, this means: there exists some time t >= current (or >= initial) such that event1 occurs.
  - If ""eventually"" allows the already-occured initial event1 (t = t0), C1 is immediately true.
  - If ""eventually"" is intended to mean ""at some future time strictly after now"", use the stricter form: there exists t > now with event1 at t.

(If you have other Cs in mind, e.g. C2 = ""event2 eventually happens"", those are defined similarly.)

4) How the conditions relate and final reasoning
- Because event1 occurred at t0, Rule B guarantees there will be a later time t1 > t0 when event2 occurs.
- Given event2 at t1, Rule A guarantees a later time t2 > t1 when event1 occurs again.
- This produces a sequence t0 < t1 < t2 < t3 < ... with event1 at t0, t2, t4, ... and event2 at t1, t3, ...
- Therefore:
  - C1 is true even if you require a future occurrence: event1 will occur again (at t2).
  - In fact, both events will keep occurring alternately indefinitely (under the assumption the ""must happen"" rules are enforceable).

Assumptions made: the rules are obligations that must be satisfied (the system can produce the required events and there is no external blocking/deadlock). If those obligations could be ignored or violated, the conclusion may not hold.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 occurs, it is terminal — nothing can occur afterwards.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — what C1 says
- C1 is the formula “event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is logically equivalent to the single statement “event2 happens” (the conjunction is just a duplicate).

Step 4 — how the facts relate and truth-value of C1
- Because the initial condition states event2 happened, the statement “event2 happens” is true. Therefore C1 (the conjunction) is true.
- Note on alternative readings: if the user instead meant “event2 happens twice (two distinct occurrences)”, you need a timing semantics:
  - Under the usual reading above (C1 is just a duplicate), C1 is True.
  - If interpreted as “there are two separate occurrences of event2 at different times,” then whether that can happen depends on how strictly you read “after event2, event1 must happen.” If that rule requires event1 to be the very next event after any event2, then a second event2 cannot occur (because event1 must intervene and after event1 no events can happen), so two occurrences of event2 would be impossible and the “two-times” reading would be False. If the rule merely requires that at some later time event1 will occur but does not forbid additional event2 occurrences before that event1, two occurrences could be allowed and then the “two-times” reading could be True — but that depends on unspecified timing semantics.

Summary answer: Under the natural reading of C1 as a duplicate conjunction, C1 is True. If you intended “event2 occurs twice,” clarify the timing semantics and I will evaluate that case.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e., whenever event2 happens, event1 will follow).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur.
- These rules force an alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … (starting from the initial event2).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- You gave only C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” This is a simple disjunction: it is true if at least one of the two events occurs (somewhere in the timeline or at the time of interest, depending on interpretation).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event2 happened initially, the disjunction in C1 is already satisfied (event2 happened). Additionally, the transition rules ensure both events will continue to occur (they alternate), so the disjunction remains satisfied in the relevant sense.

Conclusion
- C1 is True (because event2 has already happened). 

Note: if you intended a different temporal reading (for example, “at every instant either event1 or event2 is happening right now”), state that explicitly — the answer above assumes “happens” means “occurs at least once (now or eventually).”

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Formally: if event2 occurs at time t, then there exists some later time t' > t where event1 occurs.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (Formally: once event1 occurs at time t', there are no events at any time > t'.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There are no other C2/C3 given in the problem.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because the initial condition states event2 has happened, Rule A requires that event1 must occur at some later time. Rule B only restricts what happens after event1 (it forbids further events), but it does not prevent event1 itself from occurring.
- Therefore C1 (event1 eventually happens) follows directly from the initial condition plus Rule A.

Short answer: C1 is True (entailed). Explanation step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- There are no rules saying event1 happened; only event2 is given as having happened initially.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a logical disjunction asserting that at least one of the two events occurs.
- (No C2, C3 were supplied; if there are other sub-conditions you want analyzed, please provide them.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because the context asserts that event2 happened initially, the disjunction ""event2 or event1"" is satisfied immediately (a disjunction is true if either disjunct is true).
- The terminal rules only restrict further events; they don't negate the fact that event2 already happened. Those rules imply that once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward — but that does not affect the truth of the disjunction.
- There is no need to know whether event1 ever happened; the known truth of event2 is sufficient.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).
Thus any run that begins with event2 ends immediately; no further events occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1 is written as ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same disjunct twice and therefore equivalent to the single proposition ""event2 happens.""

4) How the conditions relate
- Because the initial fact says event2 happened, the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true. Therefore the disjunction in C1 is true as well.
- The terminality rules do not contradict this: they only say no events follow event2, which does not affect the truth of the fact that event2 happened.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial moment).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: “After event2, event1 must happen.” Interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur at some later time (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- Rule B: “After event1, no other events can happen.” Interpreted as: event1 is terminal (once event1 occurs, the execution stops or no further events occur).

- We are given E2 happened initially, so E2 is true. That alone makes the disjunction (E2 ∨ E1) true.
- Additionally, by Rule B, E1 must also occur at some point after the initial E2. So in fact both E2 and E1 will happen (E2 first, then E1), and after E1 nothing further happens (Rule A).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules and immediate consequences
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs, the system is terminal: no further events may occur after that point.
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So any occurrence of event2 would require a (later) occurrence of event1.
- Combining those with the initial condition: because event1 has already happened initially and rule A forbids any events after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time in this execution. There is no conflict between the rules.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreted in the usual temporal sense, this means there exists some point now or in the future at which event1 has occurred.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C1
- The initial condition directly satisfies C1: event1 has already happened, so the claim that event1 eventually happens is true.
- The terminality (no events after event1) only rules out further events (including event2) but does not contradict C1.
- Minor note on interpretation: if ""eventually"" were (unusually) required to mean strictly at some time after the initial state, then C1 would be false here because no events can occur after the initial event1. Under the standard interpretation (event1 occurs now or later), C1 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — nothing occurs after it).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to just ""Event1 happens"" (A ∨ A is A). So C1 asserts that event1 occurs.
- (If you want C2/C3 mapped to the context:)
  - C2: could represent ""After event1, event2 must happen"" (i.e., if event1 occurs then eventually event2 occurs).
  - C3: could represent ""After event2, no other events can happen"" (i.e., once event2 occurs, no further events occur).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate
- The sequence implied is: event1 occurs initially (C1 true), then event2 must occur (C2), and then nothing else can occur after event2 (C3).
- C1 being equivalent to ""event1"" is determined directly by the initial condition.

Conclusion — Is C1 True or False?
- C1 is True, because it is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" and the context states that event1 did happen.

Summary answer up front: C1 is True under the usual propositional reading (the conjunction P and P is equivalent to P). If instead C1 is intended to assert two distinct occurrences of event1 (i.e. event1 happens twice at different times), that is not guaranteed by the given facts and is therefore not provable (undetermined / not necessarily true).

Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it has occurred at least once at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then at some later point event2 will occur.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 occurs the process is terminal; nothing happens after it.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (You only listed C1; I’ll explain its possible readings.)
- C1 as written: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens.""
  - Reading 1 (standard propositional): this is P ∧ P, which is logically equivalent to P. It simply asserts that event1 happens (no extra content).
  - Reading 2 (temporal/multiplicity): it could be read as asserting two distinct occurrences of event1 (event1 happens, and then again event1 happens). That is a stronger claim — it requires event1 to occur at least twice at different times.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and what follows for C1)?
- From the initial condition we know event1 did happen at least once.
- From Rule A we also know event2 must happen sometime after that event1.
- From Rule B we know that once event2 happens, nothing else can happen afterward (so any further events after event2 are forbidden).
- Consequence for C1:
  - Under Reading 1 (P ∧ P ≡ P): C1 is True because event1 did happen.
  - Under Reading 2 (requires two distinct occurrences): that is not guaranteed by the facts. The facts give one occurrence of event1 and force event2 after it; they do not imply a second occurrence of event1 before event2 (nor after event2, which is forbidden). So C1 (as “event1 happens twice”) is not provable and may be false.

If you intended C1 to mean something specific (e.g., ""event1 occurs twice""), say so and I can evaluate that precisely.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1, directly or eventually).

From these rules the only possible sequence starting from the initial condition is: event2 happens, then event1 happens, then nothing else.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1 is the conjunction ""event2 happens and event2 happens."" In propositional logic this is equivalent to simply ""event2 happens"" (P ∧ P ≡ P).

4) How do these relate?
- Since the context states event2 happens initially, the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true. Therefore C1 (which is the same proposition repeated) is true.

Note on a possible alternate reading: if one insisted C1 required two distinct occurrences of event2, the given rules produce only one occurrence (event2 then event1), so there would be only one occurrence. But standard logical reading treats the repeated conjuncts as the same proposition, so C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens""; the context states event2 happened initially, so the conjunction is true. (If one required two distinct occurrences, that would be a different, nonstandard reading.)"

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the initial state (i.e., at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 ever occurs, then at some later point event1 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events — including event2 — can occur afterwards.)

3) Meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — means there exists some time (possibly the initial time) at which event1 occurs.

(There were no concrete C2, C3 given; if they existed they would be interpreted similarly — e.g., C2 might be ""event2 eventually happens"", meaning event2 occurs at some time.)

4) How the conditions relate
- Because event1 has already happened initially, the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" is immediately satisfied. So C1 is true.
- The terminal rule (after event1 no other events can happen) simply prevents any later occurrence of event2; it does not contradict the initial occurrence of event1.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is either irrelevant here (if event2 never occurs) or would require an event1 after event2. Both are consistent with the initial event1 only if event2 occurred before that initial event1; given the explicit initial event1, the simplest and consistent sequence is just: [event1] and nothing else.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (a logical disjunction: at least one of event1, event2 occurs).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- The context states event1 happened initially. That alone makes the disjunction (event1 OR event2) true.
- Additionally, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" means event2 will also occur, so in fact both disjuncts become true. The terminal rule does not prevent C1 from being true.
- Therefore C1 is true (entailed by the given context).

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, nothing else can occur afterward.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is stated as: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" Logically, (A or A) is equivalent to A. So C1 is equivalent to the single proposition ""Event1 happens.""
- (No C2/C3 were provided; if there were, you would interpret them similarly.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / final truth value of C1?
- The initial condition already says event1 happened. Therefore the proposition ""Event1 happens"" is true (it happened initially).
- Since C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens,"" C1 is true.
- Note about rules: Rule B (no events after event1) prevents event2 from happening after the initial event1, but that doesn't contradict the initial fact that event1 already happened. Rule A is irrelevant unless event2 occurs; it doesn't change the truth of C1 here.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"", and the initial condition states event1 happened; therefore C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is True (under the natural interpretation of ""after X, Y must happen"" as a genuine requirement that Y occurs later).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initially) event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, there must be some later time at which event2 occurs).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, there must be some later time at which event1 occurs).
(If you intend ""after"" to mean ""in the next step"" instead of ""eventually"", the reasoning is the same qualitatively.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: Event2 eventually happens (there exists some future time at which event2 occurs).

4) How do these relate?
- Because event1 holds initially and Rule A requires that after any occurrence of event1 there is a later occurrence of event2, event2 must occur at some time after the initial event1. Therefore C1 is entailed by the premises.
- Once event2 occurs, Rule B forces a later event1, which in turn forces another event2, etc., so the obligations produce at least one occurrence of event2 (and in fact an alternating sequence thereafter, under the usual semantics).

Caveat: If you meant a different semantics for ""must happen"" (e.g., a non-binding suggestion, or a rule that can be ignored so traces that violate it are allowed), then the conclusion may not hold. Under standard temporal/logical reading of ""must happen"" as a required future occurrence, C1 is True.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (i.e., at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: once it occurs, the system does not transition to any further events.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is also terminal if it were to occur.
- There is no rule allowing any event to occur before the initial state; event1 already occurred at the start.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" That means there exists some point in the execution (including the initial moment) at which event1 occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate and conclusion?
- Since event1 happened initially, the condition ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied immediately. The terminality rules do not prevent this; they only restrict events after event1. Therefore C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule 1: After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 → event1.)
- Rule 2: After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal.)

From these rules and the initial condition, the actual sequence is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is the proposition event1 → event1.
- In classical logic this is a tautology: any statement implies itself (A → A is always true). It is true whether event1 actually happens or not.

4) How the conditions relate
- Given the premises, event1 does indeed happen (because event2 happened and forces event1). So the antecedent (event1) is true and the consequent (event1) is true, making the implication true in the actual scenario.
- More generally, even without using the premises, event1 → event1 is always true as a logical tautology.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (in the initial state/run).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then a subsequent event2 is required).

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" I take the natural reading to mean “in every possible execution/run, event2 occurs (at least once).”

Step 4 — how the rules determine C1
- Because the initial state already has event2, every execution begins with event2 having occurred. The rule that no events can follow event2 only prevents additional events; it does not create any execution that lacks event2.
- The rule “after event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after event2 (event2 is terminal), and event1 before event2 is impossible given the initial condition (event2 is already true).

Conclusion
- Under the usual interpretation (“event2 occurs in every run”), C1 is True: event2 occurs in all executions (it happens initially).
- Note on ambiguity: if “always happens” were intended to mean “holds at every moment in time (is true perpetually at all future times),” that would be a different/read stricter meaning and would be False, because after the initial occurrence no further events occur but that does not mean event2 is continuously occurring at all later times.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e., the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal: once it occurs, nothing else can occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is also terminal.
(These rules only restrict what can happen after those events; they do not negate the fact that event2 happened initially.)

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 is the formula ""event2 happens or event2 happens"".
- A disjunction of identical propositions simplifies to that proposition: (E2 ∨ E2) ≡ E2. So C1 is exactly the statement ""event2 happens.""

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Since the initial condition asserts that event2 happened, the proposition E2 is true.
- Therefore C1 (which is equivalent to E2) is true.

So C1: True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: (event2 ∨ event2) is equivalent to event2, and the initial condition states event2 happened, so the disjunction is true."

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 has happened at the start (so E2 is true at time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After E2 occurs, E1 must occur (i.e. whenever E2 happens at some time t, there is a later time t' where E1 happens).
- Rule B: After E1 occurs, E2 must occur (i.e. whenever E1 happens at some time t, there is a later time t' where E2 happens).
- Together these enforce an alternating sequence E2 → E1 → E2 → E1 → … starting from the initial E2.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (here focusing on C1)
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — a logical disjunction meaning at least one of E1 or E2 occurs (at some point in the timeline).
  - Given the initial condition, E2 already happens. So C1 is satisfied.
  - In fact, the transition rules guarantee both events will occur repeatedly (E2 initially, then E1, then E2 again, etc.), so a stronger statement (""E1 happens and E2 happens"") is also true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The initial E2 immediately makes C1 true (because the disjunction is satisfied by E2).
- The transition rules ensure E1 will happen after E2 and E2 after E1, so both events occur indefinitely thereafter. Thus C1 is not only true but is a weak consequence of the stronger alternating behavior.

Conclusion: C1 is True (indeed both events occur).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Interpreted as: if event1 occurs in a state S, then in the next state S' event2 must occur.
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Interpreted as: if event2 occurs in a state S, then in the next state S' no events occur (so no event1, no event2, etc.).

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" That asks whether event2 occurs in the state immediately following the initial state (S1).

Step 4 — relate rules to C1 and evaluate
- In S0 event2 occurred, so Rule B applies: in S1 no events can happen.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur in S1.
- Rule A does not force anything here because event1 did not occur in S0.

Conclusion
- C1 is False: event2 does not happen in the next state. (This assumes the usual temporal reading that ""after"" refers to the immediate next state.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because event2 occurred in the initial state, Rule B forbids any events in the next state, so event2 cannot occur in S1."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Together these enforce alternation: starting from event1 you get event2 next, then event1, then event2, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is the statement: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""
  - Interpreting this as a propositional implication P → P (where P = “event2 happens”), it is a self-implication.
  - In classical logic P → P is always true (a tautology): whether P is true or false, P → P evaluates to true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The transition rules imply event2 will occur (given the initial event1), but that fact is irrelevant to the truth of C1: C1 is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C1 adds no constraint or information about the dynamics; it is trivially satisfied.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (so at the start of the timeline event2 has already occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs at some time t, then at some later time t' > t, event2 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred at some time, there are no further events at any later time.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This asserts that there is no time at which event1 occurs in the timeline being considered.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- We know event2 has already happened at the initial moment.
- By Rule B, once event2 has happened (and it already has), no subsequent events can occur. Therefore event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- Could event1 have occurred before the initial event2? The statement ""initially, event2 happened"" sets the start of the timeline with event2 already occurred; there is no earlier time in the scenario, so there is no place for event1 to have happened prior. (If one allowed events before the ""initial"" point, we would need extra information; with the usual reading, no earlier events exist.)
- Rule A does not force event1 to occur; it only constrains that if event1 occurs then event2 must follow. That constraint is already satisfied (we have event2), but it does not imply event1 did happen.

Therefore, under the standard interpretation of the scenario, C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is True.

Caveat: If you allow (a) event1 to have occurred before the designated ""initial"" point, or (b) simultaneous events where event1 and event2 occur at the same instant and ""after"" can be interpreted non-strictly, different readings could change the answer. Under the typical temporal reading above, C1 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Because event2 has already occurred at the initial moment and Rule B forbids any later events, event1 cannot occur in the timeline (Rule A only constrains consequences if event1 did occur)."

Answer: C1 is True (with a note about an alternate interpretation). Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the initial moment, event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is written as ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Interpreted as a logical conjunction of the same atomic fact twice, this is equivalent to simply ""event2 happens.""
- (Alternate interpretation: if someone means “event2 happens twice at two different times,” that is a different claim.)

4) How they relate and final truth value
- Since event2 happened initially, the atomic fact ""event2 happens"" is true. Therefore the conjunction ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" is also true.
- Note on the alternate interpretation: if C1 were intended to assert two distinct occurrences of event2 (one after the other), that would be impossible here because “after event2 no other events can happen,” so a second occurrence would be disallowed — in that reading C1 would be false.

So: C1 is True under the usual logical reading (same fact repeated); False only if C1 is read as requiring two separate occurrences of event2.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 happened (so the system starts in a state where event2 has already occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 occurs, the run ends).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, it is required that event2 occurs afterward).

3) What C1 says
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the implication event1 → event2.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- The context explicitly includes the rule ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" which directly entails C1.
- Even apart from that explicit rule, because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after it, event1 cannot actually occur in any extension; in that case the implication event1 → event2 would also be vacuously true. But that is unnecessary here because the implication is stated explicitly.

Therefore C1 is true (entailed by the given information).

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Meaning: whenever event1 occurs, there will be some later time at which event2 occurs (event1 implies eventual event2).
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Meaning: once event2 occurs, the trace is terminal — no further events occur after that time.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" This is a plain disjunction: at least one of event1 or event2 occurs at some point in the timeline.

4) How do these relate and does C1 hold?
- Since event1 already happened initially, the left disjunct ""event1 happens"" is already true. Therefore the disjunction ""event1 or event2"" is true regardless of what else happens.
- Additionally, by Rule A, event2 will also occur later (so both disjuncts hold), and by Rule B nothing happens after event2 — but that does not affect the truth of the disjunction.

- Interpreted temporally/causally (e.g., “if event1 happens now then event1 will happen later”), it is either vacuous or redundant. Given the transition rules, event1 does indeed occur repeatedly, so any reasonable temporal reading that requires event1 to occur at some time is also satisfied.

Step 4 — how these relate
- The transition rules ensure event1 will occur (because event2 occurred initially), and thereafter it recurs. But you do not need those rules to judge C1 under standard logic: p → p is true in all cases.
- C1 therefore provides no new constraint; it is always true (and, in this system, also true in any temporal/operational sense).

Conclusion
- C1 is True.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (event1 ⇒ event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can occur (event2 is terminal).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Symbolically: event1 ⇒ event1.
- This is the self-implication A ⇒ A, which is a logical tautology: it is always true for any proposition A.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Independent of the transition rules, event1 ⇒ event1 is always true.
- In the specific system described, event1 actually cannot occur after the initial event2 (since event2 already happened and is terminal), so the antecedent ""event1 happens"" is false in every model of the system. An implication with a never-true antecedent is vacuously true. Either way (tautology or vacuous truth), C1 holds.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. every occurrence of event2 is followed at some later time by an occurrence of event1).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. every occurrence of event1 is followed at some later time by an occurrence of event2).

(You can formalize these as temporal formulas: initially e2. And G(e2 -> F e1) and G(e1 -> F e2).)

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Interpretations:
  - Non-strict: there exists some time t ≥ 0 where event2 occurs (including the initial moment).
  - Strict/future: there exists some time t > 0 where event2 occurs (strictly after the initial moment).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Under the non-strict interpretation, C1 is immediately true because event2 has already occurred initially.
- Under the strict/future interpretation, the transition rules force a cycle: initial e2 -> (by Rule A) some later e1 -> (by Rule B) some later e2. Thus event2 will occur again in the future, so C1 is true as well.

Caveat: this conclusion assumes the rules are enforced and the timeline allows further steps (i.e., the system does not terminate immediately and ""must happen"" is an enforced guarantee). Given the stated assumptions, C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (we start in a state where event2 occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Read as: whenever event2 has happened, event1 will (inevitably) occur at some later time (i.e., eventually).
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Read as: once event1 occurs, the system reaches a terminal state (no further events follow).

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1 (given): ""Event1 eventually happens."" That is, at some time after the initial moment, event1 occurs.
- (No C2, C3 were specified in the problem; if there were, one would define them similarly.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition: event2 has happened.
- From Rule A: whenever event2 has happened, event1 must (eventually) happen.
- Therefore, given the initial event2 and Rule A, event1 will occur at some later time. Rule B only constrains what happens after event1 (it makes event1 terminal) and does not prevent event1 from occurring.
- Conclusion: C1 is True (entailed by the premises), assuming ""must happen"" means inevitability and there are no conflicting rules that block event1.

Short answer: C1 is True (under the usual reading). Now step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs it is followed by event2).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event1).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" The natural temporal reading is: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward (i.e., event2 implies a later event1). In linear temporal logic this is G(event2 -> F event1) (or stronger G(event2 -> X event1) if “after” means “immediately next”).

4) How do these relate and is C1 true?
- Start: event1 (given).
- By Rule A, that event1 is followed by event2.
- By Rule B, that event2 is followed by event1.
- Thus the system produces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- Therefore every time event2 occurs it is (by Rule B) followed by event1, so C1 is true.

Caveat: if you read “happens” differently (e.g., simultaneity, or rules can be violated or the process can halt despite “must”), the truth-value can change. Under the standard interpretation of the given rules (“must happen” = guaranteed subsequent occurrence), C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 happened. (We assume no other simultaneous occurrences unless stated.)

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreting “after” as the usual immediate/following-step obligation)
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs at time t then event2 must occur at the next step t+1).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs at time t then event1 must occur at t+1).
- Taken together these force alternation between event1 and event2 (under the usual immediate-next-step reading).

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting “always” in the standard temporal logic sense: at every time step (globally), event2 is true.

Step 4 — how the rules relate and evaluation of C1
- Start at t0: event2 happens (given).
- By Rule B, at t1 event1 must happen.
- By Rule A, at t2 event2 must happen.
- By Rule B, at t3 event1 must happen.
- And so on: the pattern is e2, e1, e2, e1, ...
- Therefore event2 holds at t0, t2, t4, … but not at t1, t3, … — so there are times when event2 is false.

Conclusion
- Under the usual reading (“always” = at every time step, and “after” = next step), C1 is False. Counterexample: at t1 event1 holds and event2 does not.

Caveats / alternative readings
- If “always” were taken to mean “infinitely often” (event2 occurs again and again), then that weaker claim would be True (event2 occurs at every even step).
- If concurrent/simultaneous occurrences are allowed and the system permits both events to hold at every step, then it is possible (in that model) for event2 to hold at all times — but that requires changing the usual interpretation.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened. (So at the start of the timeline event2 is true.)

Step 2 — transition / exclusivity rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (If event1 occurs at some time, no further events can occur afterward.)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (If event2 occurs at some time, no further events can occur afterward.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1 is written as ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" That is redundant; logically it is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens."" So C1 is true exactly when event1 happens, and false otherwise.

Step 4 — how the facts relate and conclusion
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" blocks any other events from occurring after that point.
- Under the usual reading (initial = the starting fact; no earlier occurrence of event1 is given), event1 does not happen at any time.
- Therefore C1 (i.e., ""event1 happens"") is False.

(If you allow the possibility that event1 occurred before the “initial” time or that events could be simultaneous, conclusions could change; with the standard interpretation above, C1 is false.)

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.

2) Transition rules:
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards (or as consequence).
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen thereafter (event1 is terminal).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1 is written ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — both disjuncts are the same, so C1 is logically equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event1 has already happened initially, and the rule says ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- The context gives no evidence that event2 happened at the same initial instant or prior to event1. Under the natural reading (initial state only event1 happened), event2 does not happen.
- Therefore the proposition ""Event2 happens"" is false, so C1 (which is the same) is false.

Note on edge cases: If you allowed event2 to have occurred simultaneously with event1 at the initial moment (contrary to the usual reading), then C1 could be true — but the given context (""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"") most naturally implies event2 does not happen, so C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already happened and is terminal (""after event1 no other events can happen""), so event2 cannot occur; C1 (""event2 happens"") is therefore false."

Short answer: You cannot conclude C1 as true from the given information. C1 (""Event1 happens or event1 happens"") is just the proposition ""Event1 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same literal), and that is not entailed by the facts and rules — it is undetermined (could be true in some histories and false in others).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen. (So nothing can occur at times strictly after the time of event2.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs at some time t, then at some later time t' ≥ t event2 occurs.)

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1 is written ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice. Logically it reduces to the single proposition ""Event1 happens.""

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- We know event2 did happen (initially). From that alone we cannot infer that event1 happened before it. Rule B says if event1 happens then event2 must happen (so event1 → event2), which is consistent with event2 happening, but the converse does not hold (event2 does not imply event1).
- Rule A prevents any events after event2, so event1 could not occur after the given initial event2. Event1 could only have occurred before event2 (if it did at all).
- Therefore there are two possible consistent histories:
  a) event1 happened earlier, and then event2 happened (satisfies rule B and the initial fact) — C1 true.
  b) only event2 happened (no event1 at any time) — also consistent with rules — C1 false.

Conclusion: C1 is not logically entailed by the premises. It is undetermined (possibly true in some models, false in others). If you must answer a single truth value for entailment, the correct answer is: C1 is not provable (i.e., not guaranteed true).

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 → event2 will occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is a terminal/absorbing event.)

3) What C1 means
- C1 is the proposition ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same proposition repeated (A or A ≡ A). So C1 is true exactly when event2 happens.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From (1) and (2): because event1 happened and the rule requires event2 to happen after event1, event2 does happen.
- Therefore the proposition ""event2"" is true, hence C1 (""event2 or event2"") is true.

Note/caveat: this assumes the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is an actual guarantee (a temporal inevitability), not merely a desirability or soft constraint. Under the usual reading of the given rules, C1 is true.

Answer: C1 is False (contradicted).

Step-by-step:

1. Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur at the start.

2. Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 follows.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

3. Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 states: ""Event1 does not happen."" It asserts event1 did not occur.

4. How the condition relates to the context
- The context explicitly states event1 happened initially. That directly contradicts C1.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false (contradicted) given the context.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Justification: The context explicitly states ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so the claim ""Event1 does not happen"" is contradicted."

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (so there is an initial state where event1 occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: once it has occurred, the system can have no further events.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" That means in every possible run/trace of the system, event2 occurs at some point.

(You mentioned C2, C3 but did not give them; if you have them I can define those similarly.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- Because event1 has already happened initially and rule A makes event1 terminal, no events can occur after that initial event1. Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 occur before the initial event1? No — the initial condition says event1 happened initially (at the start), so there is no earlier time for event2 to occur.
- Moreover, if event2 were to occur at any time, rule B requires event1 to happen after it. But rule A forbids any events after event1, and the only event1 occurrence is the initial one (which is before event2), so it is impossible to have the required event1 after event2 — creating a contradiction. Thus event2 cannot occur in any run.
- Since event2 never occurs, the claim ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is false.

Note on ambiguity: if one read rule B as merely “if event2 occurs then event1 must have occurred at some point (not necessarily after)” then the reading changes; but as written (""After event2, event1 must happen"") the natural reading enforces ordering (event1 after event2), and the conclusion above applies. If you intended a different meaning, tell me and I will re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 has already happened initially and Rule A makes event1 terminal (no events can occur after it), so event2 cannot occur in any run. Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" is false."

Short answer: C1 is True (entailed by the context).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, event2 will follow.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 will follow.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is precisely the same as Rule A: event1 ⇒ event2.

4) How they relate
- Because Rule A is explicitly given in the context, C1 is directly entailed. The initial occurrence of event1 simply activates that rule (so event2 must occur afterward). Rule B adds that event2 will in turn force event1, producing an alternating sequence, but that does not invalidate C1.

Therefore C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the current/initial state is one in which event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen.
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen.
(So each event is terminal: once either happens, no further events occur afterward.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That asserts that immediately after the initial state, event1 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because the initial state already has event2, Rule A applies: no events can happen after event2. Therefore event1 cannot occur in the next state.
- Assuming the ordinary reading of ""after"" / ""next state"" (i.e., temporal succession, not simultaneous co-occurrence), C1 contradicts Rule A and must be false.

If you intended a different semantics (e.g., simultaneous events allowed in the same state or ""next state"" has another specific meaning), state that and I can re-evaluate.

- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal.)

- Since event2 happened and the rule says event1 must follow, event1 does happen.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (so the system begins in the “just after event2” situation).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen.
These give deterministic alternation: once in the “after event2” situation you must go to event1, and once in the “after event1” situation you must go to event2.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1 is stated as “Event1 always happens.” This phrase can be read in different precise ways:
  a) “Event1 happens at every time instant (globally true)” — i.e., at every moment event1 is occurring.  
  b) “Event1 happens at least once in the execution (eventual occurrence).”  
  c) “Event1 happens infinitely often (repeatedly / in every sufficiently long future).”  
  d) “In every possible execution trace, event1 occurs (inevitably).”

4) How do these relate and is C1 true or false?
- From the rules and the initial condition the infinite trace is: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Therefore:
  - Interpretation (b) “event1 happens at least once” is True (event1 happens immediately after the initial event2).
  - Interpretation (c) “event1 happens infinitely often” is True (alternation ensures event1 recurs forever).
  - Interpretation (d) “in every possible execution event1 occurs” is True (the rules force event1 in every allowed trace).
  - Interpretation (a) “event1 holds at every time instant” is False (there are time points when event2 has just happened, so event1 is not true at those times).

Conclusion: C1 is True under the natural meanings “event1 will occur” or “event1 occurs infinitely often / inevitably.” C1 is False only if you interpret “always” to mean “at every instant” (i.e., continuously true), which is not what the alternation rules imply.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the run starts with event2 occurring).

Step 2 — transition/post rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — if event1 occurs, the run is terminal (nothing happens afterwards).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — if event2 occurs, the run is terminal.

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" — a universal implication: whenever event2 occurs in a run, event1 must also have occurred (before, after, or simultaneously, depending on intended semantics). For the implication to be true, there must be no possible run in which event2 occurs but event1 does not.

Step 4 — relate conditions and decide C1
- The context gives a concrete run: initially event2 happened. Because event2 happens and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" nothing (including event1) can happen after it. Also, since event2 was initial, event1 could not have happened before.
- Thus there is a run where event2 happens and event1 does not. That is a counterexample to C1.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, the system stops.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is terminal: once event2 occurs, the system stops.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" means there exists some time (at or after the initial moment) at which event1 occurs.

4) How do the conditions relate and conclusion?
- Because event2 has already happened in the initial state and event2 is terminal (no further events can occur after it), no future occurrence of any event, including event1, is possible.
- Unless the problem intended that event1 also occurred simultaneously with event2 at the initial moment (which the statement did not assert), event1 does not occur at any time.
- Therefore, under the given information, C1 is False.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (so we start in a state/trace where event2 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So if event1 occurs at some point, the trace ends there (no further events).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Likewise, if event2 occurs, the trace ends there.
- There are no rules allowing any further events after either event1 or event2.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as a universal claim: in every possible execution/trace, event1 occurs at some point.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- We have an explicit initial trace where event2 has already happened and, by the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" the trace ends immediately. In that trace, event1 does not occur.
- Since ""always happens"" requires event1 to occur in every possible trace, the existence of this initial trace where event1 does not occur is a counterexample.

Conclusion: Because there is at least one possible (indeed the given initial) trace where event2 occurs and prevents any further events, event1 does not occur in that trace. Therefore C1 is False.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Now step-by-step as you requested.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially (at the start).

2) Transition rules / interpretation
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreted strictly: once event1 has occurred, there are no further events at any later time (event1 is terminal).
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted strictly: if event2 occurs at some time t, then at some later time > t event1 must occur.

(If you intended different temporal semantics — e.g. ""after"" meaning ""preceding"" or allowing simultaneous occurrences or allowing repeated occurrences — see the alternate-interpretation note below.)

3) Meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" That is, at some time after the initial moment, event2 occurs.

(You mentioned C2, C3, etc., but none were given; only C1 is present.)

4) How the facts and conditions relate (and conclusion)
- Because event1 has already happened initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no further events can ever occur.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- Consequently C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- Note: Rule B is then vacuously satisfied (or irrelevant) because its antecedent, ""event2 occurs"", never holds.

Alternate-interpretation note (if your temporal language was intended differently)
- If ""after event1 no other events can happen"" were meant non-strictly or only for that particular occurrence (e.g., event1 can reoccur later), or if ""after event2 event1 must happen"" meant ""event1 must have happened before event2"" (i.e., a prerequisite), the truth of C1 could change. Under the strict, usual reading given above, C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event1 has already occurred and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time; therefore ""event2 eventually happens"" is false. Rule B is vacuously satisfied."

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it is given as true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 has occurred, then event1 will occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 occurs, the trace ends—no further events occur.)

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- You only asked about C1. Interpreting C1 as stated: “Event1 always happens.” I take this to mean “in every execution (starting from the given initial condition), event1 occurs” (i.e., event1 inevitably happens given the initial conditions and rules).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? (and conclusion about C1)
- Since the initial condition says event2 has happened, Rule A requires that event1 must occur after that. There is no rule that can prevent event1 from occurring. Rule B only restricts events after event1 (it stops further events), it does not prevent event1 itself.
- Therefore, under the given initial condition and rules, event1 will occur in every possible run.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

(Footnote: if by “always” you instead meant “is continuously true at every moment” or some other nonstandard reading, the answer would need re-interpretation. Under the usual temporal reading “event1 inevitably occurs,” C1 is true.)

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so at some later time after event1, event2 occurs).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is the statement ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (i.e. both events occur at some point).
- (No C2/C3 were given; if they exist they'd be interpreted similarly as propositions about occurrence/order of events.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since event1 has happened initially, Rule A requires that event2 happen afterwards. Thus both event1 and event2 occur, in that order.
- Rule B only prohibits any events after event2; it does not prevent event2 from occurring after event1. There is no contradiction.

Conclusion: Given the initial condition and the rules, both event1 and event2 occur (event1 first, then event2), so C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start (the initial state/trace includes event2).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then (after it) event2 must happen. (event1 ⇒ next include event2)
- Rule B: If event2 happens, then no other events can happen afterward. (event2 is terminal)

3) What does C1 mean?
- Interpreting ""C1: Event1 always happens"" in the normal sense: in every possible execution (every valid trace consistent with the initial condition and the rules), event1 occurs (at least once). (If you meant some other reading of ""always"" say so, but this is the usual interpretation used for such questions.)

4) How do these conditions relate and does C1 hold?
- Because the initial state already contains event2 and event2 is terminal (no events can occur after it), there is a perfectly valid execution/trace where only event2 occurs and event1 never occurs.
- That trace violates ""event1 occurs in every execution"", so C1 is false.

Short answer: C1 is False (not entailed by the context).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions are involved?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules?
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Once event1 occurs, it is terminal — no subsequent events, including event2, can occur.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This asserts that any occurrence of event1 implies that event2 also occurs (either before, after, or at the same time depending on interpretation, but typically it means event2 occurs at some time in relation to that event1).

4) How do these relate and what follows?
- From the context we know event1 does happen (initially).
- Rule B says that once event1 happens, no further events can occur. So event2 cannot occur after that event1.
- There is no rule asserting that event2 already happened before the initial event1, and Rule A only mandates event1 after event2 — it does not force event2 to ever happen.
- Therefore there is no basis in the context to conclude event2 occurs at all. Because event1 forbids any later events, the context does not support ""event1 implies event2.""

Possible ambiguity note: If one allowed simultaneous occurrences or an interpretation that event2 must have occurred before the initial event1, that would need to be stated. Under the natural reading given, C1 is not true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start (the initial state contains event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has occurred, the trace is terminal — there are no subsequent events.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 ever occurs, then at some later point event2 must occur.)

Step 3 — meaning of the hypothesis (C1)
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — i.e. there exists some point in the trace (at or after the initial state) where event1 occurs.

(Interpretation note: I assume a usual linear-time ordering where ""after"" means strictly later, events are not concurrent, and the initial state is the earliest point.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- The initial state already contains event2.
- By Rule A, once event2 has occurred (as it has initially), no further events can occur after that point. Therefore there is no later state in which event1 could occur.
- Rule B does not force event1 to happen; it only constrains what must follow if event1 occurs. It can be vacuously satisfied if event1 never occurs.
- Therefore, under the given assumptions, event1 cannot eventually happen.

Final answer: C1 is False.

(If you intended a different timing model — e.g. allowing events to occur before the initial state or allowing simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment — tell me that and I can revisit the conclusion.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 already holds and Rule A forbids any further events after event2, so event1 cannot occur later; Rule B is conditional and doesn't force event1."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (So if event1 happens, then event2 will happen.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1 is written as ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are identical, so C1 is logically equivalent to the single statement ""Event2 happens."" (This is not a logical tautology like P ∨ ¬P; it just redundantly repeats the same proposition.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial fact (event1 happened) and Rule A (""after event1, event2 must happen""), we deduce that event2 does in fact happen.
- Rule B only says nothing follows event2, it does not prevent event2 from occurring.
- Therefore the proposition ""Event2 happens"" is entailed by the given information.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E1 has happened at the start (call that time t0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After E2 occurs, E1 must occur (i.e., an occurrence of E2 forces a later occurrence of E1).
- Rule B: After E1 occurs, E2 must occur (i.e., an occurrence of E1 forces a later occurrence of E2).
(“After” is the only ordering given; I’ll treat it as “in the next step” for a simple discrete timeline. If “after” were allowed to mean “sometime later,” the same alternating consequences follow qualitatively.)

Step 3 — meaning of sub-conditions
- C1 (given): “Event1 always happens.” This phrase is ambiguous and admits two common readings:
  - C1a (invariant reading): E1 holds at every time point from now on (for all times t ≥ t0).
  - C1b (recurrence reading): E1 will continue to occur repeatedly (infinitely often) in the future.
- (If you have other named conditions like C2, C3, you can map them similarly; e.g. C2 might be “E2 always happens” with the same two readings.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C1
- Starting from t0: E1 occurred.
- By Rule B (after E1 → E2), E2 must occur next (call that t1).
- By Rule A (after E2 → E1), E1 must occur next (t2).
- This produces the alternating sequence: t0: E1, t1: E2, t2: E1, t3: E2, ... and so on indefinitely.

Conclusion about C1:
- Under the invariant reading C1a (“E1 at every time point from now on”): C1 is False. At t1, E1 does not hold (E2 holds instead), so E1 is not true at every time.
- Under the recurrence reading C1b (“E1 will occur infinitely often”): C1 is True. The rules force an infinite alternation so E1 occurs at t0, t2, t4, ….

If you want, tell me which reading of “always” you intend (or whether simultaneous occurrences are allowed), and I’ll state the answer unambiguously for that semantics.

- Events involved: event1 and event2.

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur afterwards.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is also terminal if it occurs.

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the implication event2 → event1: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must also occur (either earlier, simultaneously, or later).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- We are told event2 does happen (initially). The transition rule for event2 forbids any other events happening after it, so event1 cannot occur after event2. There is no information that event1 occurred before or at the same time as event2. Therefore nothing in the premises entails event1.

Short answer: C1 is True (under the normal reading that ""happens"" means ""occurs at least once"").

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at some initial time t0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 happens, event1 must happen (so at some time t1 > t0, event1 occurs).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, event2 must happen (so at some time t2 > t1, event2 occurs).
(“After” here meaning at a later time; it guarantees occurrence, not necessarily instant or simultaneous occurrence.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens” — i.e. both events occur (each at least once) at some times.

4) How they relate and final verdict
- Because event2 already happened initially, Rule A requires event1 to happen afterward. So event1 does occur. Therefore both event2 and event1 have happened, so C1 is true.
- (If you instead meant “happens” as “happens simultaneously at the same instant,” the rules as stated use “after” so simultaneity is not implied; under that stricter reading C1 would be false. But under the usual temporal reading—occurs at least once—C1 is true.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 has already happened initially; Rule A then requires event1 to happen later, so both events occur (event2 at t0 and event1 at some t1>t0)."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.

- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e., every occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1).

Given the initial event2 and these rules, the system forces an alternating sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … (event1 will occur, then event2, and so on).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 is written as “Event1 happens and event1 happens.” This is logically equivalent to just “Event1 happens” (A ∧ A ≡ A).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- Because event2 happened initially and rule B requires an event1 after every event2, event1 will indeed occur (at least once, and in fact repeatedly).
- Therefore C1 (“Event1 happens”) is True under the given assumptions.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 follows event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stops after event1).

A simple timeline consistent with these rules:
- time 0: event2 occurs (initially).
- time 1: event1 occurs (must follow event2).
- time 2 and onward: no events occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" in the usual temporal/logical sense means: at every time point (or in every reachable state), event2 occurs. (If you meant some other reading of ""always"" — e.g., ""event2 eventually happens at least once"" — say so; that is a different claim.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and does C1 hold?
- Given the timeline above, event2 occurs at time 0 but does not occur at time 1 or later (because after event1 no events can happen). Thus event2 is not true at every time point.
- Therefore, under the usual meaning of ""always,"" C1 is false: event2 does not always happen.

If you intended a different meaning of ""always"" (for example, ""event2 happens at least once in every run"" or ""event2 is guaranteed to occur sometime""), say which meaning you want and I can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs at the start but not at every time point (after event1 no events can occur), so ""Event2 always happens"" is false."

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the start/initial time event2 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 → event1 at the next step or sometime afterward.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, the system stops producing further events.)

3) What the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (Taken in the natural reading as claiming event2 never happens / did not happen.)

4) How they relate and conclusion
- The initial condition explicitly states event2 happened. That directly contradicts C1. Therefore C1 is false.
- For completeness: the rules allow the sequence event2 (initial) → event1 (required) and then nothing else. That does not make C1 true: event2 did occur (initially), so C1 fails.

Note on possible ambiguity: if C1 were intended to mean ""event2 does not happen after some later time"" (i.e., it only happened initially), that weaker claim could be compatible with the facts, but the plain reading ""event2 does not happen"" contradicts the given initial fact.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.
(Interpreting “must happen” as a deterministic obligation that, when its antecedent has occurred, the consequent will occur.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 is written as “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” That is redundant: A ∧ A is equivalent to A. So C1 simply asserts that event2 happens.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth of C1
- Given event1 happened initially, Rule A requires event2 to happen afterward. Therefore event2 does happen.
- Since C1 is equivalent to “event2 happens,” C1 is true under the stated rules and initial condition.

Notes/assumptions
- This conclusion assumes the “must happen” rules are enforceable and there are no external contradictions or interruptions that prevent the required events. If “must” were only a weak tendency or could be blocked, then truth could be uncertain.

Short answer: C1 is True — given the three statements, event2 must occur in every allowed execution (trace). Below is a step-by-step breakdown.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so the system starts in a state where event1 has already occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This is a liveness requirement: whenever event1 has occurred, some (later) occurrence of event2 is required.
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" This makes event2 terminal: once event2 occurs, the execution stops (no further events occur).

3) What does the hypothesis C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted naturally as: in every possible execution consistent with the initial condition and rules, event2 occurs at some point.

(If one instead read C1 as ""event2 holds at all times"" — i.e. an invariant that is true at every moment — that would be a different meaning and would be false, since initially only event1 has happened and event2 has not yet happened. But the usual reading in this context is the existence-of-event reading above.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final verdict)?
- Because event1 has happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces an eventual event2, every permitted trace must include event2.
- The rule that nothing happens after event2 does not prevent event2 from occurring; it only prevents further events after it.
- Therefore, under the natural interpretation of C1 (event2 occurs in every run), C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Since event1 has already happened and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces an eventual occurrence of event2 in every allowed execution, event2 must occur; the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" only makes event2 terminal and does not prevent it."

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start (so event1 is true initially).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs at some time t, then at some later time > t event1 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Once event1 has occurred, no further events are allowed afterwards.)

3) Meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1 is the conjunction ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" That requires both events to occur at least once somewhere in the timeline.

4) How these relate and final inference
- event1 already happened initially. By Rule B, no events can occur after that initial event1. Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No — the phrase ""initially, event1 happened"" places event1 at the start of the timeline, so there is no earlier time for event2 to have happened.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time, so ""event2 happens"" is false while ""event1 happens"" is true.
- Thus C1 (event1 happens AND event2 happens) is false (because the conjunction requires both true).

Note: If the phrasing of the rules were intended differently (for example, ""after"" meaning ""preceded by"" or ""initially"" allowing prior events), the conclusion could change — but under the natural reading above, C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event1 has already happened and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time; therefore the conjunction ""event1 and event2"" is false."

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2 (no others are mentioned).
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (so at time 0, event2 is true).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, then sometime afterwards event2 will occur).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred, it forbids any further events).

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this naturally: in the system/run of interest, event1 occurs (or occurs in every possible trace). In either reading, C1 claims event1 is guaranteed to occur at some point (or in all executions).

4) How the pieces relate and conclusion
- Because event2 holds initially, Rule B immediately prevents any further events after that initial moment. Therefore event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- Nothing in the premises forces event1 to have occurred before the initial moment (and the statement only says “initially event2 happened,” not that event1 also did).
- A simultaneous interpretation (that event1 could have happened at the same initial instant as event2) is not supported by the given facts, and even if allowed it is not implied by the rules — there is no rule that guarantees event1 ever occurs.
- Thus there is no guarantee that event1 happens in the system; C1 is not entailed.

Step-by-step answer.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, the system permits no further events.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some time (at or after now) when event2 occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C1 true or false?
- Because event1 already happened initially and Rule A bars any events from happening after event1, no event (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Rule B only constrains what must follow if event2 were to occur; it does not require event2 to occur.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time consistent with the given facts and rules.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event1 happens.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 happens at time t, then event1 must happen at time t+1.
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — if event1 happens at time t, then event2 must happen at time t+1.

These rules create an obligation that whenever one event happens, the other must occur in the next state.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions (interpreting C1, C2, C3)
- C1 (as given): ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — means event1 holds at t1 (the state immediately after the initial state t0).
- Reasonable complementary conditions you might consider:
  - C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — event2 holds at t1.
  - C3: ""Event1 happens at t2"" — event1 holds at t2.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial condition (event1 at t0) and Rule B (after event1 → event2 at next state), we must have event2 at t1. So C2 is entailed (true).
- From event2 at t1 and Rule A (after event2 → event1 at next state), we must have event1 at t2. So C3 is entailed (true).
- C1 (event1 at t1) is not entailed by the given rules. The rules force event2 at t1, and force event1 at t2, but they do not require event1 at t1. Therefore, C1 is False as a necessary fact.

Caveat: if you additionally assume (a) exactly one event can occur per state (mutual exclusion), then t1 must be event2 and therefore event1 cannot occur at t1 — that also makes C1 False. If, instead, you allow multiple events to co-occur in a state, event1 might happen at t1 as well (so C1 would be possible), but it is not guaranteed by the rules. In all cases, C1 is not guaranteed/entailed — answer: False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: from event1 at t0, Rule B requires event2 at t1; from that, Rule A requires event1 at t2. Event1 at t1 is not required by the rules (it may be possible if co-occurrence is allowed, but it is not entailed), so C1 is not guaranteed."

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => event1 is a terminal/absorbing event: once event1 has occurred, no further events may occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => event2 is also terminal: once event2 occurs, no further events may occur.

3) Meaning of the condition C1
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a (redundant) assertion that event2 happens at some point. So C1 is true exactly when event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate (and conclusion)
- Because event1 happened initially and event1 is terminal, no event can occur after event1. Therefore event2 cannot occur after event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before event1? No: if event2 had occurred before event1, then event1 would be an event occurring after event2, but that contradicts ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 cannot have occurred before event1 either.
- Thus event2 cannot have occurred at any time under these rules.

Therefore C1 (that event2 happens) is false.

False

Step 0 — restating the scenario (short)
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has just happened.
- Rules (transition rules): after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
These rules force an alternation: … event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → …

Now the four requested steps.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs, then (at the next appropriate point) event2 must occur afterwards.
- If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.
- Together these imply alternation: starting from the initial event1 you get event2 next, then event1, then event2, and so on.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (Interpretation of C1)
You wrote only C1: “Event2 always happens.” This phrase is ambiguous; possible formal meanings:
- Meaning A (strong): “Event2 holds at every moment” (temporal logic: G event2). This says event2 is true at all times/states.
- Meaning B (weak / liveness): “Event2 happens at least once sometime in the future” (F event2).
- Meaning C (recurrent): “From any point in time, event2 will eventually happen” (G F event2, often read “event2 always eventually happens”).
- Meaning D (infinitely often): “Event2 occurs infinitely often” (which is equivalent to G F event2 in an infinite run).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C1 under each interpretation?
From the alternation sequence starting with event1:
- Sequence example: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (repeating).
Evaluate each meaning:
- Meaning A (G event2): False. event2 is not true at the times when event1 occurs (e.g., at the initial moment event1 holds and event2 does not).
- Meaning B (F event2): True. Because after the initial event1, the rule requires event2 to happen next, so event2 will happen at least once.
- Meaning C / D (G F event2 / infinitely often): True (assuming the system continues as rules require indefinitely). Since events alternate forever, event2 occurs repeatedly (infinitely often) and from any point in time there is a future event2.

Summary answer about C1
- If “always happens” means “holds at all times” (G event2) → C1 is False.
- If it means “will happen at least once” (F event2) or “will always eventually happen / occur infinitely often” (G F event2) → C1 is True.

If you want a single crisp verdict, tell me which formal meaning of “always” you intend; otherwise the most common reading in plain language (“event2 is guaranteed to occur repeatedly after the initial event1”) leads to: event2 does occur (indeed infinitely often), but it is not true at every moment.

- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition stated: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the start (the current/initial state) event2 has occurred.

- Since event2 has happened initially and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" there cannot be any event in any subsequent state, including the next state.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur in the next state.

Conclusion: C1 is False. (Only caveat: if one interprets ""next state"" as the same instant as the initial state or allows simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment, the answer could differ — but under the standard reading that ""next state"" means a state after the initial one, C1 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 has already occurred initially, and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" so event1 cannot occur in the next state."

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (time 0) event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: Whenever event1 happens, the next event must be event2.
- Rule B: Whenever event2 happens, the next event must be event1.
- Together these force an alternating sequence of occurrences: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (assuming events are instantaneous and occur one after another).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- You only gave C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This needs a precise interpretation; two common readings are:
  - Global (strong) reading: “always” means at every time point (in temporal-logic notation: G(event1)). That is, event1 holds at all times.
  - Recurrence (weaker) reading: “event1 happens infinitely often” or “event1 happens repeatedly” (in LTL: GF(event1)), or “event1 happens at least once.”
- If there were other conditions (C2, C3) you would similarly need to fix whether “always”, “eventually”, or “infinitely often” is intended.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? (and answer whether C1 is True or False)
- Under the natural interpretation of the rules (strict alternation), the sequence is event1, event2, event1, ... so:
  - Global reading (G(event1)): False. Because at the times when event2 occurs, event1 does not hold, so event1 is not true at every time.
  - Recurrence reading (GF(event1) or “event1 occurs infinitely often”): True. Event1 occurs at times 0, 2, 4, ... forever.
  - “Event1 occurs at least once”: True (it occurs initially).
- Conclusion: If C1 means “event1 always holds at every time,” then C1 is False. If C1 means “event1 occurs repeatedly / infinitely often” (or just “occurs at least once”), then C1 is True.

If you had a specific formal meaning of “always” in mind, tell me which one and I’ll give the answer under that reading.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0) event2 has occurred.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen.
I will assume “after” means in the next state (the immediately following state), and that states are discrete and one event happens per state (no simultaneous events). If you meant “eventually” or allow concurrency, see the note at the end.

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — i.e., in state 1 (the state immediately after the initial state).

4) How they relate and evaluation of C1
- State 0: event2 (given).
- By Rule A, in the next state (state 1) event1 must happen.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in state 1.
- By Rule B, event2 will then happen in state 2, and the sequence alternates: state0: e2, state1: e1, state2: e2, state3: e1, …

Conclusion: Under the stated assumptions, C1 is False.

If instead “after” meant “eventually” (not necessarily immediate), the nearest next state still must be event1 (unless concurrency is allowed), so C1 is still False. Only if you allow events to co-occur in the same next state (both e1 and e2 together) could C1 be True; but that would contradict the usual reading of the given “after” rules. Would you like me to evaluate under different assumptions (e.g., “after” = eventually, or simultaneous events allowed)?

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: State0 has event2. Rule A forces event1 in the immediately next state, so state1 is event1 (not event2). Hence C1 (""event2 in the next state"") is false under the given assumptions."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (initially) event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event1 happens, then afterwards event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- If event2 happens, then no other events can happen after it (event2 is terminal).

(Implicit assumption I’ll use: “after” means strictly later in time and “initially” is the start of the timeline — i.e. there are no earlier events unless stated.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: “Event1 happens and event1 happens.” This is just a redundant conjunction; it is equivalent to the single claim “event1 happens.”
- No C2, C3 were given in the prompt.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; truth of C1
- Because event2 has happened initially and event2 is terminal (no events can occur after it), no further events (including event1) can occur after the initial moment.
- Under the usual reading (no events before the initial state, “after” is strict), event1 cannot occur at any time.
- Therefore C1 (i.e. “event1 happens”) is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so event2 follows event1).
- After event2 occurs, no further events can occur (the run terminates).

From these rules the only possible finite trace is: event1 (initial) → event2 → stop.

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” This phrase is ambiguous:
  - Interpretation A (existential-in-every-run): “In every possible execution/run, event1 occurs at least once.” (i.e., event1 happens in all runs)
  - Interpretation B (global/at-all-times): “At every time point/state, event1 holds/occurs” (a strong “always” meaning globally true at every moment)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Given the initial condition that event1 happened and the rules that deterministically force event2 then stop, every run contains event1 (it occurs in the initial state). So under Interpretation A, C1 is True.
- Under Interpretation B (that event1 holds at every time point), C1 is False, because after the initial moment event1 does not keep occurring (event2 happens next and then no other events).

Short conclusion
- If “always” means “in every run at least once”: True.
- If “always” means “at every time point (globally)”: False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Assuming “always” means “in every possible execution/run, event1 occurs at least once” → True.

- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal; nothing can occur after it.)

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (This asserts that event2 never occurs.)
- No C2/C3 were provided; if there were, they'd be other assertions about event occurrences.

4) How the conditions relate
- The initial condition directly asserts that event2 has happened.
- C1 asserts the opposite (that event2 does not happen), so C1 contradicts the initial condition.
- Therefore C1 is false given the context.
- Additional notes: Rule A is satisfied if event1 occurred before that initial event2 (or if event1 never occurred). Rule B implies no events can occur after the initial event2. But none of that rescues C1 — the initial event2 makes C1 impossible.

Answering step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., event2 never occurs)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Given the rules, occurrences must alternate: after any event2 there must be an event1, and after any event1 there must be an event2.
- Because event2 has already happened initially, the rules force event1 to happen next, and then event2 to happen again after that, and so on. Thus event2 does occur (at least initially and repeatedly thereafter).

Conclusion about C1:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is False. It contradicts the given initial condition (event2 did happen), and the transition rules also ensure event2 will continue to occur.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Reasoning:
- Events: event1, event2. Initial condition: event2 has already happened.
- Rules: event1 → event2 must happen after; event2 → event1 must happen after.
- Since event2 already occurred, the rules force event1 next, then event2 again, etc. So event2 does occur (now and repeatedly).
- C1 claims ""Event2 does not happen"", which contradicts the initial condition and the transition rules.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial time, event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs at some time t, then at some later time t' > t event2 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (If event2 occurs at time t, then no events occur at any time t' > t.)

I assume ""after"" denotes a strict later time (not simultaneous). If you intend a different temporal semantics, say so.

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant statement equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (i.e., there exists a time at which event1 occurs).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Initially event2 already happened at the earliest time. By Rule B, once event2 has occurred no events can occur afterward. Since the initial event2 is at the start, there is no later time at which event1 could occur. Under the strict reading of ""after,"" event1 cannot occur before the initial moment (there is no earlier time), nor after (forbidden by Rule B). Therefore event1 does not happen.

Conclusion: C1 (which asserts event1 happens) is false.

Note about alternative semantics: If ""after"" were allowed to be non-strict or you allow simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment (i.e., event1 and event2 can both hold initially together), conclusions could differ. With the usual strict reading above, C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Given event2 has already occurred and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" event1 cannot occur at any later time, so the statement ""event1 happens"" (hence C1) is false."

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initially) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — once event2 occurs, the system reaches a terminal state and no further events occur at strictly later times.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — similarly, event1 would also be terminal if it ever occurred.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Formally: there exists some time t ≥ 0 in the future (including the initial moment, if you allow that) at which event1 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because event2 already happened initially and event2 is terminal, there can be no events at any later time. Unless event1 happened at the same instant as event2 at the initial moment (which is not stated), event1 does not occur at any time.
- Therefore, under the usual reading (only event2 happened initially and no simultaneous occurrence is assumed), C1 is False.

Note on edge case: if the model allowed simultaneous events at the initial instant and the problem intended that event1 also happened at that same instant, then C1 would be true. But with the given plain reading (only event2 happened initially), C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 already occurred initially and is terminal (no later events allowed), and there's no indication event1 occurred simultaneously. Therefore event1 does not eventually happen."

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred at the start.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next (or at some next step).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
So the rules force alternation: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3) What does C1 mean?
- You stated C1 as ""Event1 always happens."" This phrase is ambiguous. Two common formal readings:
  a) ""Always"" = globally: at every time step (for all times t, event1 holds). Formal: G(event1).
  b) ""Always"" as a liveness/recurrence claim: event1 will continue to occur (infinitely often, i.e. repeatedly). Formal: GF(event1) (event1 happens infinitely often / eventually after every cycle).
Also other interpretations: ""Whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows"" — that is a different (and weaker) claim, but it is in fact exactly one of the given rules.

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial event2 and the two rules we get the infinite alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Under interpretation (a) — event1 holds at every time — C1 is False, because the initial time (and every other time when event2 occurs) is not event1.
- Under interpretation (b) — event1 occurs infinitely often / after each event2 — C1 is True: event1 does occur repeatedly (indeed after every event2).

So: if by ""always happens"" you mean ""at every time instant,"" C1 is False. If you mean ""keeps happening / occurs infinitely often (or always follows event2),"" C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: the rules force alternation starting with event2, so at the initial time (and every other step) event1 is not true. If ""always"" is read as ""at every time instant"" (G event1) the claim is false. (If ""always"" were meant as ""repeatedly/infinitely often"" then it would be true.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — i.e., the claim that event1 never occurs (or at least did not occur initially).

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- The context explicitly states that event1 happened initially. That directly contradicts C1.
- The terminal rules only restrict events after an event occurs; they do not negate the fact that event1 already happened. (They imply, for example, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, but that doesn’t make C1 true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial moment (start of every execution) event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., event1 inevitably occurs sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From these rules the allowed behaviour in every execution is: event2 occurs at the start, then at some later point event1 occurs, and thereafter nothing else occurs.

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
C1: “Event2 always happens.” This phrase is ambiguous. Two common readings:
- Reading A (global/temporal “always”): at every moment in time (globally), event2 holds. In temporal-logic notation: G(event2).
- Reading B (occurrence-in-every-run): in every possible execution/run, event2 occurs at least once (i.e., event2 happens in all runs, not necessarily at all times).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and verdict for C1
- Under Reading B (occurs in every run at least once): True. The initial condition states event2 happened at the start of every execution, so every run contains event2.
- Under Reading A (holds at every moment): False. event2 holds at the initial moment but after event1 occurs (and thereafter) event2 will no longer hold at those later times, so it is not true at all moments.

Conclusion
- If you mean “event2 happens in every execution” (Reading B): C1 is True.
- If you mean “event2 holds at all times (always globally)” (Reading A): C1 is False.

If you tell me which formal meaning of “always” you intend, I’ll give the single definitive answer in that semantics.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is given as the starting fact).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => once event1 has happened, no further events may occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => similarly, event2 would also be terminal.
Both rules make event1 and event2 terminal states (no successor events).

3) What C1 means
- C1 states: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" The conjunction repeats the same claim, so C1 simply asserts that event2 happens (it must occur at some point).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule says that after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur afterwards.
- Therefore the claim that event2 happens is false in this scenario.
- Conclusion: C1 is False.

Note/caveat: If you allowed event2 to have occurred before the given ""initial"" moment or simultaneously with event1 (and your semantics of ""after"" excludes simultaneous occurrences), the information would be insufficient and C1 might be undetermined. Under the usual reading where ""initially event1 happened"" is the starting event and ""after event1"" forbids any later events, C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 has already happened and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents event2 from occurring afterward, so the claim that event2 happens is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (call that time t0).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, at some later point event1 will occur.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, at some later point event2 will occur.)

(“After” can be read as “immediately next” or “eventually afterwards”; the qualitative conclusions below hold for either reading.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” This phrase is ambiguous:
  - Interpretation 1 (strong): event1 holds at every moment in time (always true at every instant).
  - Interpretation 2 (weaker): event1 occurs repeatedly from now on (i.e., it will keep occurring infinitely often / recurs indefinitely).
  - Interpretation 3 (very weak): event1 happens at least once (or happens sometime in the future).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C1
- From the rules and the initial event1 at t0 we get a forced alternation:
  - t0: event1 (given).
  - By Rule B there must be an event2 after t0 → some t1: event2.
  - By Rule A there must be an event1 after t1 → some t2: event1.
  - Repeating the same reasoning yields event2 at t3, event1 at t4, etc.
- Therefore event1 occurs at t0, t2, t4, ... (infinitely many times).

Conclusion about C1
- If C1 is interpreted as “event1 occurs at every instant” (Interpretation 1): C1 is False.
- If C1 is interpreted as “event1 happens at least once” (Interpretation 3): C1 is True (it happened initially).
- If C1 is interpreted as “event1 will keep occurring (infinitely often)” (Interpretation 2): C1 is True (the rules force an infinite alternation so event1 recurs forever).

If you had a specific formal meaning of “always” in mind, tell me which one and I’ll give the single definite True/False answer for that meaning.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

(If ""always"" is meant weaker — e.g., ""occurs infinitely often"" or ""occurs at least once"" — then C1 would be True, but under the usual reading ""always"" = true at every moment, it is False.)"

Short answer: C1 is False (not supported by the context).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event2 has happened (this is given as the starting state).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (event2 is terminal).

3) What C1 means
- C1 is written ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is redundant; assuming ""Event1"" and ""event1"" refer to the same event, A ∨ A = A, so C1 simply asserts ""event1 happens.""

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- The context asserts event2 happened initially and that event2 is terminal, so no events can occur after that point. That rules out event1 happening after the given initial event2.
- The rules do not assert that event1 happened before the initial event2; there is no evidence in the context that event1 occurred at any time.
- Therefore the claim ""event1 happens"" is not entailed by the context. So C1 is false (not provable from the given information).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" The context only states that event2 has happened and that event2 is terminal (no events can occur after it). There is no information that event1 happened before the given event2, so ""event1 happens"" is not entailed."

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1. Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at least once, at the start).

2. Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.
(Interpretation: each occurrence of one event forces an occurrence of the other afterward.)

3. What C1 means
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens” — i.e., both events occur (at least once) at some points in time.

4. How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since event1 has already happened initially, Rule A requires that event2 must happen afterward. Therefore event2 occurs.
- Once event2 occurs, Rule B requires that event1 must happen afterward (again). Thus event1 occurs again (and that in turn forces event2 again, and so on).
- Therefore both event1 and event2 do happen (in fact they will alternate indefinitely under these rules).

Conclusion: Given the initial event1 and the stated transition rules, C1 is true (both events occur). 

Note: This assumes “must happen” is a strict requirement that can be satisfied (no external blocking). If additional constraints could prevent the required follow-ups, the answer might differ.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (event1 → eventually event2).

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — i.e. from the initial state, at some future point event1 occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because event2 already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no events (including event1) can occur after the initial moment.
- The rule ""event1 → event2"" does not force event1 to occur; it only constrains what must follow if event1 does occur.
- Therefore, from the given facts there is no way for event1 to occur in the future of the initial state. Unless you allow event1 to have occurred before the initial state (which is not stated), event1 does not eventually happen.

Final answer: C1 is False. (Not entailed by the premises; in fact, given the premises, event1 cannot happen after the initial state.)

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (Formally: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward.)
Together these force an alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — i.e. both events occur (at some points in the execution).  
(There were no C2, C3 given; if present, they would similarly be propositions about occurrence/timing of events.)

4) How do these conditions relate and does C1 hold?
- We start with event2 (given). By Rule A, event1 must occur after that. So both event2 and event1 occur — C1 is satisfied. Moreover, after that event1, Rule B forces event2 again, and so on; so both events occur (indeed infinitely often under the rules).
- Therefore C1 is True.

(If you want a formal view: with initial event2 and G(event2 → F event1) and G(event1 → F event2), we have F event1 true and event2 already true, so C1 holds.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 is given to have occurred; the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ensures event1 will occur afterward, so both event2 and event1 occur (and then the other rule forces event2 again, etc.). Thus C1 holds."

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 has happened (so we start in a state after event1 occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., in any successor state following a state where event1 occurred, no events occur).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (i.e., if event2 occurs, it also blocks any subsequent events).

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — it asserts that in the immediate next state after the initial one, event2 occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since we start in a state where event1 already happened and Rule A forbids any further events after event1, it is impossible for event2 to occur in the next state. Rule B is irrelevant for this instance because event2 never gets to happen.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at some initial time t0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" = whenever event2 occurs, event1 will (or must) occur afterwards.
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" = whenever event1 occurs, event2 will (or must) occur afterwards.

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is written as ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just the conjunction of the same proposition with itself. Logically, (event2 AND event2) is equivalent to event2.

4) How the conditions relate and final inference
- From the initial event1 (t0) and Rule B (""after event1 → event2""), event2 must occur at some later time (call it t1). Therefore event2 is true (it happens).
- Given that, C1 (which is equivalent to event2) is satisfied. There is no contradiction introduced by Rule A; it only implies future event1 occurrences after event2, but that does not prevent event2 from occurring.

So C1 is True. (Note: if you meant something else by ""must happen"" or by temporal scope, specify and I can adjust the analysis.)

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0), event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (as stated)
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (i.e., once event1 has happened at some state, there are no occurrences of any events in later states.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (i.e., if event2 occurs at some state, then event1 must occur at a subsequent state.)

3) What C1 means
- C1 asserts: event2 happens in the next state (i.e., event2 occurs at state1, immediately after the initial state0).

4) Combine the facts
- Because event1 happened at state0 and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no event (including event2) can occur at state1.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen in the next state.

Conclusion: C1 is false.

(If you intended a different reading of “after event1, no other events can happen” — for example, that it only forbids simultaneous events in the same step or only forbids the immediate next step — please say so and I’ll re-evaluate under that interpretation. Under the natural reading above, C1 is false.)

Short answer: C1 is False (not entailed). Reasoning below, step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the initial point in time.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Once event1 has occurred, no further events occur.)

(Assumption: ""after"" means strictly later in time, and time progresses forward from the initial state.)

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — i.e., there is some future time at which event2 occurs.

(There are no C2, C3 given in your statement; only C1 is specified.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion about C1
- Because event1 is true initially, by Rule B no events can occur after that initial point. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any future time.
- Rule A would require that if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterwards, but event1 already occurred initially and precludes any later events — so the only way to avoid contradiction is that event2 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false — the context does not entail that event2 happens; in fact, given the usual interpretation it cannot happen after the initial event1.

Note on alternative interpretations: If you allow nonstandard timing (e.g., events before the initial point, or ""after"" including ""at the same time""), the conclusion could change. Under the standard linear-time reading above, C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already occurred and Rule B forbids any events after event1, so event2 cannot occur at any future time; thus ""event2 eventually happens"" is not entailed."

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is terminal: if event1 occurs, nothing occurs afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is also terminal.
- No rule allows an event to happen before the initial moment; the only stated occurrence is that event2 happened initially.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is the statement ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to the single statement ""Event1 happens"" (A or A = A). There are no other C2, C3 given.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, no other events can occur after that initial event2. Therefore event1 does not happen (it neither happened initially nor can it happen afterward).
- Since C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" and event1 does not happen under the given facts, C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 reduces to ""event1 happens."" The given initial fact is that event2 happened and both events are terminal, so event1 does not happen. Therefore C1 is false."

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules between events?
- “After event1, event2 must happen” means: whenever event1 occurs at some time t, there must be an occurrence of event2 at some later time > t.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” means: whenever event2 occurs at time t, there must be an occurrence of event1 at some later time > t.
(So the two events mutually force each other to occur after the other.)

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens” is redundant. Logically P ∨ P = P, so C1 simply asserts “event2 happens.”

4) How do these conditions relate and does C1 hold?
- From the initial event1 and the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 must occur at some later time. Therefore “event2 happens” is true, so C1 is true.
- (As a side note, once event2 occurs the other rule forces event1 again, and so on; this yields an alternating sequence, but you only need the initial event1 to deduce at least one occurrence of event2.)

Caveat: This assumes “must happen” means the rules are enforceable and there are no external constraints preventing the required occurrences. Under that normal reading, C1 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: From initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 does occur, so C1 (which is just ""event2 happens"") is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: Event1 and Event2.
- Initial condition given: Event2 has already happened at the start (“Initially, event2 happened”).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After Event2 happens, no other events can happen. (Once Event2 occurs, the system is terminal — no further events are possible.)
- Rule B: If Event1 happens, then Event2 must happen afterwards. (Event1 → Event2 sometime after Event1.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: “Event1 happens and Event2 happens.” So C1 is the conjunction (Event1 occurred) AND (Event2 occurred).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and whether C1 is true
- We already know Event2 happened (initial condition). So the second part of C1 (Event2 happens) is true.
- Can Event1 happen? Rule A forbids any events after Event2. Since Event2 already happened initially, Event1 cannot happen after that point.
- The only way Event1 could also be true is if Event1 happened before the initial Event2. Two readings:
  1. Strict reading of the scenario: “Initially, Event2 happened” is the starting fact and there is no earlier history → Event1 did not happen. Under this reading Event1 is impossible, so C1 is false.
  2. Permissive reading: the scenario allows a past where Event1 happened earlier and then Event2 happened (which would satisfy the implication Event1→Event2). In that case both Event1 and Event2 could be true and C1 would be true. But that possibility is not asserted by the given initial condition.
- Given the usual interpretation of the three sentences (Event2 has happened initially and after Event2 no further events can occur), Event1 cannot occur, so C1 is false.

Conclusion: Unless you explicitly allow Event1 to have occurred before the stated initial Event2, C1 is false. Under the natural reading of the provided information, C1 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (time 0) event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, the next required event is event1).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, the next required event is event2).
Taken together these force an alternation: once event2 has happened, the rules require event1 next, then event2, then event1, etc.

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is stated as “Event2 always happens.” There are two common readings:
  a) Strong/global reading: “Event2 holds at every time point” (i.e., at all times).
  b) Repetition reading: “Event2 occurs repeatedly / infinitely often” (i.e., it keeps occurring again and again, not necessarily at every instant).
Which reading you intend matters for the truth value.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and verdict for C1
- Given the initial event2 and the two transition rules, any compliant timeline is: time0 event2, time1 event1, time2 event2, time3 event1, … — event1 and event2 alternate forever.
- Under the strong/global reading (a): C1 is False — event2 does not occur at every time point (it does not occur at the times when event1 occurs).
- Under the repetition reading (b): C1 is True — event2 occurs at time0 and at every even time thereafter, so it occurs infinitely often.

Short conclusion
- If “always” means “at every time”: C1 is False.
- If “always” means “repeatedly / infinitely often”: C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Interpreting ""always"" as ""at every time,"" the events alternate (event2, event1, event2, ...), so event2 does not hold at the times when event1 occurs."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1 is terminal — once event1 occurs, the sequence ends.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, then at some later time event1 will occur.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This asserts that event2 never occurs.

4) How they relate
- The initial condition explicitly says event2 happened. That directly contradicts C1. Therefore C1 is false.
- Additional consequences: because event2 did happen, rule B forces event1 to occur later; and once event1 occurs, rule A prevents any further events. Those consequences do not make C1 true — they only describe what follows from event2 happening.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened. (So at the start of the scenario event1 is true; event2 is not stated to have happened initially.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: nothing may occur after it.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred.)
- Together these say that whichever of the two occurs, it prevents any further events after it.

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1 is the statement ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" Logically, A or A is equivalent to A, so C1 is simply the claim ""event2 happens.""

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and evaluation of C1)?
- Because initially event1 happened and rule A forbids any other events after event1, event2 cannot happen at any later time. There is no indication event2 happened before the initial moment, so under the given information event2 does not occur.
- Therefore the claim ""event2 happens"" (i.e., C1) is false.

Short answer: C1 is True (assuming the ""must happen"" rules are hard/obligatory).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur sometime later.
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime later.

(“After” is read as “at some future time”; “must” is read as a required occurrence.)

3) What C1 means
- C1 = “event1 happens AND event2 happens.” That is, there exists at least one occurrence of event1 and at least one occurrence of event2 (not necessarily simultaneous).

4) How the conditions relate / conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened initially, Rule B requires that event1 must happen at some later time. So event1 will occur.
- Once that event1 occurs, Rule A requires that event2 must occur again at some later time.
- Therefore both event1 and event2 occur (event2 already did, event1 must occur, and then event2 again). So C1 is satisfied.

Note on assumptions: This conclusion assumes the transition rules are obligations that will be fulfilled. If instead “must happen” were only a possibility or a nonbinding preference, you could not conclude for sure. Under the usual reading as hard temporal constraints, C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: initially, event2 happened. (So the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred.)

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is also terminal.)
So whichever of event1 or event2 occurs, the run ends immediately afterward. No further events can occur once either has happened.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual sense: in every possible execution/run (starting from the given initial conditions and following the rules), event1 occurs at some point.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final judgment
- The initial condition already specifies event2 happened at the start.
- Because event2 is terminal (""after event2 no other events can happen""), no event1 can occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore in the actual run allowed by the initial condition, event1 does not occur.
- Since C1 requires event1 to occur in every run, and we have a run (the actual initial run) where event1 does not occur, C1 is false.

Edge-note about simultaneity: if you allow event1 and event2 to occur simultaneously at the initial moment, you would need that explicitly stated. Under the usual reading (initially event2 happened and that prevents any subsequent events), event1 does not occur. So C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Reason: the initial state already has event2, and event2 is terminal (no further events can occur), so event1 does not occur in that run; therefore ""Event1 always happens"" is false."

Answer: C1 is False (not entailed).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: initially, event1 happened (so in the provided scenario/run/event sequence, event1 occurs at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (event2 follows event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

This yields a required sequence: event1 → event2 → stop.

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" asserts a universal property: event1 occurs in every relevant situation — e.g., in every possible run/execution or at all times — not just at the initial moment.

4) Relation and conclusion
- The context only states that event1 happened initially (so it happens at least once in the given scenario). It does not state that event1 occurs in every possible run or at every time.
- Therefore you cannot conclude the stronger universal claim ""event1 always happens.""

So C1 is not supported by the premises and is False (not entailed).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Explanation: The premises state event1 happened initially in this scenario, but do not assert it occurs in every possible run or at all times. Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" is not entailed."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., at the start event1 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (Interpretation: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur sometime afterward.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur sometime afterward.)
These rules make the two events mutually forcing/alternating.

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is an implication from event1 to event2. Given the wording of the rules, C1 is asserting the same relation as Rule A (that event2 follows event1, at least eventually).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because the context explicitly states ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" C1 is directly entailed by that rule. (Assuming ""after"" is read as “eventually follows” and ""if...then..."" is intended in that temporal sense.)
- Therefore C1 is True.

(If you meant a different reading of ""if"" — e.g., instantaneous/simultaneous implication rather than eventual/temporal — mention that and I’ll adjust the answer.)

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (time 0) event2 has happened (event2 is true in the initial state).
- ""Next state"" means the immediate successor state (time 1).

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen. Interpreting this normally: if event2 is true at time t, then at time t+1 (and thereafter) no events occur — in particular, event1 cannot be true at t+1.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. Interpreting this: if event1 is true at time t, then event2 must be true at t+1.

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" means event1 is true at time 1 (the immediate successor of the initial state).

(If there were other subconditions C2, C3 we would interpret them similarly — e.g. C2 might say event2 at the next state, etc.)

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because event2 is true initially (time 0) and Rule A forbids any events after event2, no event can occur at time 1. Therefore event1 cannot be true at time 1.
- Rule B (after event1, event2 must happen) is irrelevant here because event1 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 (event1 in the next state) is false.

Note on interpretations: this conclusion assumes the natural reading that ""after event2 no other events can happen"" forbids events in the successor state. If you intended a different timing/semantics (e.g. simultaneous events allowed, or “after” meaning something else), state that and I can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event2 is true at the initial state and ""after event2 no other events can happen"" forbids events in the successor state, event1 cannot be true in the next state."

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened (so the system starts in a state where event2 is true/has occurred).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes any state following (or at and after) event2 terminal with respect to events — no further events may occur once event2 has happened.
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards (event2 is required to follow event1).

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreting ""next state"" as the state immediately following the initial state.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the verdict?
- The initial state already has event2. By Rule A, once event2 has happened no other events can happen subsequently. Therefore event1 cannot occur in the next state (or at any later time).
- Rule B is irrelevant because event1 never occurs (if it did, event2 would have to follow, but event2 already happened and Rule A forbids any further events).
- Therefore C1 is false under the natural reading of the given statements.

Note on ambiguity: If one reinterprets temporal scope (e.g., ""after event2"" meaning only immediately after a specific occurrence, or ""initially"" meaning something else), conclusions could change. Under the usual interpretation above, C1 is false.

Short answer: C1 is False (given the usual reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 happens, no other events can happen afterward.
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no other events can happen afterward.
(These are terminal/absorbing rules: once either event occurs, the system prevents any further events.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is written as ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" That is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" C1 is true exactly when event1 occurs at some time; otherwise it is false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and evaluation of C1)?
- Because event2 has already happened initially and Rule A forbids any other events afterwards, event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial state.
- There is no information that event1 happened before the initial state; the given initial fact is that event2 happened initially. Under the natural interpretation (no simultaneity and ""after"" means later times), event1 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 (which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"") is false.

Note on assumptions: If you allow simultaneous occurrences (event1 and event2 at the same instant) or interpret ""initially event2 happened"" differently (e.g., only that event2 occurred at some time but event1 could have occurred earlier), the answer could change. Under the standard temporal reading above, C1 is False.

False

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e. in every possible evolution (in every reachable state/timeline) event2 occurs at some point.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 has already happened initially and rule A forbids any further events after event1, no further event (including event2) can occur in that evolution.
- Thus there exists at least one reachable evolution (indeed the actual initial one) where event2 does not happen. That falsifies the universal claim ""event2 always happens.""

Therefore C1 is False. (If you intended a different semantics, e.g. events can occur simultaneously at the initial step, state that and I can re-evaluate.)

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (the system starts in a state where event2 occurred).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no further events may occur afterwards (event2 is terminal).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" If event1 occurs at some time, then event2 must occur later (or at least after that occurrence of event1).

3) What C1 means
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is a redundant disjunction; it is equivalent to the single statement ""event1 happens"" (i.e., that event1 occurs at some time).

4) How the conditions relate and verdict
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no events can occur after that point — so event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- There is no support in the given facts that event1 occurred before the initial event2 (the statement says event2 happened initially), so we should not assume event1 occurred prior.
- The rule ""if event1 then event2"" does not imply event1; it only constrains what must happen if event1 did occur.
- Therefore C1 (that event1 happens) is incompatible with the given constraints and is false under the standard reading.

Note on ambiguity: If one allowed event1 to have happened strictly before the stated ""initial"" event2 or allowed simultaneous occurrences, the conclusion could change — but with the usual reading of ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" C1 is false.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., at the start/event time 0, event1 has occurred).

2. Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs at some time t, then at some later time t' > t event1 must occur.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, no events (including event2) may occur afterwards. Event1 is terminal.

3. Meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreted as a global claim that event1 never occurs at any time.

4. How the conditions relate and conclusion about C1
- The context explicitly states event1 happened initially. That directly contradicts C1, which asserts event1 does not happen.
- The other rules are consistent with the initial event1: because event1 already happened, no events can occur after it (so event2 cannot occur later), and the ""after event2 then event1"" rule is either irrelevant (if event2 never occurs) or already satisfied (if event2 had occurred before and event1 followed). None of this makes C1 true.

Therefore C1 is False.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so every execution/trace starts with event1 having occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., given event1 occurred, event2 is required to occur afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted relative to the given scenario: in every execution consistent with the stated initial condition and rules, event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate / deduction
- Because the initial state includes event1 and the rule says event2 must follow event1, event2 will occur in every allowed execution. The fact that event2 is terminal only stops further events; it does not prevent event2 itself. Therefore C1 holds.

Possible caveat: if one instead read ""always"" to mean in all imaginable runs regardless of the given initial condition, you would need to know whether there can be runs where event1 never occurs. But under the provided context (""Initially, event1 happened""), C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is not guaranteed — False (not entailed).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules (from the context)
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (Meaning: sometime after the state where event1 occurred, there must be a state where event2 occurs.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal: once it occurs, no further events occur.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That asserts that in the immediately following state after the initial one, event1 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and the verdict
- From the premises we know event1 already occurred initially and that at some point afterward event2 must occur, and once event2 occurs nothing else happens.
- Nothing in the premises requires event1 to occur again in the next state. The rules force event2 to occur eventually, but they do not force a repetition of event1 immediately next. Therefore C1 is not entailed.
- Example showing C1 can be false (consistent with the rules): initial state: event1. Next state: event2. (This satisfies ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and makes no events occur after event2.) Here C1 is false.
- C1 could be true in some other model (e.g., if event1 repeats), but it is not forced by the given information.

Conclusion: C1 is not necessarily true — answer: False (not provable from the given statements).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already happened initially and the rules only require that event2 occur sometime afterward and that nothing happens after event2.

Step 0 — assumption about time/orientation
- I read ""Initially, event1 happened"" as describing the current/initial state (i.e., event1 has already occurred), and ""eventually"" in C1 as meaning “at some point in the future from this initial state.” If you meant something else (e.g., allowing events before the initial state), say so.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward (i.e., event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal; it forbids any subsequent events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — from the initial state, at some future time event2 occurs.
- (No C2/C3 were given; if there are other conditions you want analyzed, list them.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C1?
- Since event1 has already happened initially and rule B says no events can happen after event1, no further events (including event2) can occur in the future from the initial state.
- Rule A only constrains what must follow if event2 does occur; it does not force event2 to occur by itself.
- Therefore, under the stated assumptions, event2 cannot happen in the future, so C1 is false.

Answer: C1 is False (given the usual reading that “initially” is now and “eventually” means future).

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (So occurrence of event1 guarantees that event2 will occur at some later point.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (event2 is terminal — once it happens, nothing follows.)

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is a redundant conjunction; logically it is equivalent to the single claim ""event2 happens.""

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial fact (event1 happened) and Rule A, we must conclude that event2 happens.
- That satisfies the (redundant) conjunction in C1. Rule B does not prevent event2 from happening; it only forbids events after event2.
- Therefore C1 is true.

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially (at time t0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (at some later time).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (at some later time).

(“After” here I treat as “at some strictly later time” unless you tell me simultaneous occurrences are allowed.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (You asked only about C1; I’ll state the natural interpretations.)
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is ambiguous. Two natural readings:
  a) “Event2 holds at every time point” (globally true at all times).
  b) “Event2 keeps happening forever” in the sense “infinitely often” (in LTL notation: G F event2, i.e. always eventually event2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and the verdict on C1)?
- Starting from t0 with event2, Rule B forces an event1 at some t1 > t0. Rule A then forces an event2 at some t2 > t1, and so on. So the system enforces an alternating sequence of occurrences: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Consequences:
  a) If C1 is interpreted as “event2 occurs at every time point” — False. There are times (e.g. when event1 occurs) where event2 does not hold.
  b) If C1 is interpreted as “event2 occurs infinitely often / always eventually” — True. From the initial event2 the rules force a repeating alternation, so event2 will keep reoccurring indefinitely.

Edge cases / assumptions:
- If “after” allowed to be immediate (simultaneous occurrences) the alternation could collapse in different ways, but under the usual “strictly later” reading the above alternation and conclusions hold.
- If there are ways to halt the system or prevent required events, that would change things; I assumed the rules are obligations that must be satisfied and can always be satisfied by scheduling the next event.

Short answer: Under the usual interpretation, C1 is False if “always” means “at every moment”; C1 is True if “always” means “occurs infinitely often / always eventually.”

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the start/event 0, event2 occurs).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => event2 is terminal: once event2 occurs, no further events occur.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => event1 is also terminal: once event1 occurs, no further events occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" That is the claim that event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- The context explicitly states event2 did happen initially. That directly contradicts C1.
- Whether event1 can happen is irrelevant to C1, and the terminal rules only restrict further events after one occurs.

Answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (i.e. whenever event1 has happened, event2 will occur subsequently.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (event2 is terminal — once it occurs, the execution stops.)

3) Meaning of the condition C1
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This asserts that in every possible execution from the initial condition, event2 occurs.

4) How they relate / inference
- Since event1 has already happened initially and Rule A requires event2 to happen after any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur in every execution starting from the initial state.
- Rule B only restricts what happens after event2 (no further events); it does not prevent event2 from occurring.
- Therefore event2 does occur in all executions.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

(If you intended a different semantics for ""must"" — e.g. permissive rather than universal — say so; under the usual reading that ""must"" means required in all executions, the conclusion above holds.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — this asserts that event1 never occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The initial condition directly asserts event1 happened. Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") contradicts the initial condition.
- Rule A makes event1 terminal, so no further events (including event2) can occur after the initial event1. Rule B is then irrelevant in the actual timeline because event2 cannot occur after event1; if one tried to have event2 occur first, Rule B would require event1 afterward, but Rule A would forbid any event after event1 — so the only consistent timeline given the initial fact is that event1 happened and nothing else happened.

Conclusion: Because event1 is given to have happened initially, the statement ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.

False

Reason: the initial condition states event1 happened, so the claim ""Event1 does not happen"" contradicts that and is therefore false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e. at the start of the system/run, event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then later event2 occurs.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal — once it occurs, the run ends / no further events occur.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1 is: “Event1 always happens.” This can be read two ways:
  - Strongest reading (global): event1 holds at all times. Clearly impossible here because event2 holds initially.
  - Usual reading for occurrence claims: in every run/execution, event1 occurs at least once. I’ll use this standard reading (every possible execution includes an occurrence of event1).

Step 4 — how the facts relate and verdict
- There exists a valid execution consistent with the context: the initial event2 occurs and, by Rule B, nothing else ever happens after that. In that execution event1 never occurs.
- Since there is at least one execution (the initial event2-only run) where event1 does not occur, the claim “event1 occurs in every execution” is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial moment).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (Formally: whenever event1 occurs, a future occurrence of event2 must follow; e1 -> F e2.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (Formally: whenever event2 occurs, a future occurrence of event1 must follow; e2 -> F e1.)

I assume these are liveness constraints (""must happen"" = there will be a future occurrence), and that the system can continue producing events (i.e., we consider infinite traces).

Step 3 — what C1 means (disambiguation)
""C1: Event1 always happens."" This phrase can be read in different ways:
- Interpretation A (global/always): event1 holds at every moment (globally): G e1.  
- Interpretation B (eventually): event1 happens at least once in the future: F e1.  
- Interpretation C (infinitely often): event1 keeps happening repeatedly (GF e1).

Step 4 — relation of rules to C1 and final answer
- From the initial event2 and Rule B (e2 -> F e1) we get F e1: event1 will occur at least once. So Interpretation B is true.
- Because after that event1 occurs, Rule A forces a future event2, and then Rule B forces another event1, etc., the constraints force an alternation (under the usual infinite-trace assumption). That implies event1 occurs infinitely often (GF e1). So Interpretation C is true under the usual assumptions.
- However, Interpretation A (G e1: event1 at every time point) is false: at the initial moment event2 occurred, so event1 did not hold at that time, and in general event1 does not hold at the times when event2 occurs.

Conclusion (answer to ""C1 is True or False?"")
- If C1 is intended as ""event1 always holds at every time point"" (G e1): False.
- If C1 is intended as ""event1 happens at least once"" (F e1) or ""event1 happens infinitely often"" (GF e1): True (given the stated rules and the usual infinite execution assumption).

If you meant a specific formal reading of ""always,"" tell me which one and I’ll state the result under that reading and any required assumptions.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: If ""always"" means ""at every moment"" (G e1), it's false — initially event2 occurred, so e1 did not hold then. (If you meant ""event1 eventually happens"" or ""infinitely often,"" those would be true under the given rules.)"

Short answer: C1 is not guaranteed (so treated as False if you ask whether it must be true). Now the step-by-step breakdown you requested.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event1 happened (event1 holds at time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” Interpreting “after” as the usual immediate-next-state constraint: whenever event1 holds in some state, event2 must hold in the next state.
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” Similarly: whenever event2 holds in some state, event1 must hold in the next state.
(If “after” were intended to mean “eventually sometime later” rather than “next state,” the conclusions below are similar in spirit but about eventual occurrences rather than immediate next-state occurrences. I’ll point out differences where relevant.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 (given): “Event1 happens in the next state.” That asserts event1 holds at time 1 (the state immediately following the initial state).
- (Possible complementary sub-conditions you might consider) C2: “Event2 happens in the next state” — asserts event2 holds at time 1. C3: “Event1 and event2 both happen in the next state,” etc. (Only C1 was provided; I describe likely others for completeness.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the rules and the initial condition: initial has event1, and the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” forces event2 to hold in the next state (time 1). So C2 (event2 at time 1) is entailed.
- That rule does not force event1 to hold in the next state. The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” would force event1 at time 2 (the state after time 1), because event2 is true at time 1. So you can conclude event1 will hold at time 2, but not necessarily at time 1.
- Therefore event1 at time 1 (C1) is not entailed by the given information. It might occur (nothing forbids event1 and event2 co-occurring at the same state), but it is not required by the stated rules.

Conclusion: C1 is not necessarily true given the context. If you mean “must C1 hold in all models/traces satisfying the premises?” — answer: no. If you want a stronger/alternative semantics (e.g., “after” = “possibly in the very next state too” or simultaneous occurrence allowed), then C1 could be true in some models, but it is not guaranteed by the premises.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Initial event1 forces event2 in the next state (by ""after event1""), and that in turn forces event1 in the following state, but nothing requires event1 to hold immediately in the next state, so C1 is not guaranteed."

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it occurred initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., event2 will occur at some point following event1).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 is the statement ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction of the same proposition; logically it is equivalent to the single claim ""Event2 happens.""

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since event1 happened initially and the rule says event2 must happen after event1, event2 does in fact happen. Rule B only says no events can occur after event2; it does not prevent event2 from occurring after event1.
- Therefore the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true, and so the conjunction ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" (C1) is true.

Short answer: C1 is True (both events will happen).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (at some later time).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (at some later time).
These are liveness/implication rules: whenever one happens, the other is required to happen afterward.

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- You gave C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (No other C2, C3 were specified.)
- C1 therefore asserts that both events occur (not necessarily simultaneously; just that each occurs at least once).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event2 already happened initially, Rule B (""after event2, event1 must happen"") forces event1 to happen at some later time.
- Once event1 happens, Rule A (""after event1, event2 must happen"") forces event2 to happen again later.
- This can repeat indefinitely (alternating occurrences), but at minimum both events will occur at least once.

Conclusion: Given the initial event2 and the two ""after"" rules, both event2 and event1 will occur, so C1 is True (assuming the rules are enforced and ""must happen"" is satisfiable).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Both events will occur: event2 has already happened, and by ""after event2, event1 must happen"" event1 will occur; thus C1 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (an occurrence of event2 exists at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If an event2 occurs, then an event1 follows.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (If an event1 occurs, then an event2 follows.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a conditional statement asserting that any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1.

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Rule A is exactly the same as C1: it states that whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen.
- Therefore, under the natural reading that the context gives a general transition rule (not just about the initial occurrence), C1 is entailed by the context and is True.

(If one instead interpreted the context to apply only to the single initial occurrence of event2, C1 would still be true for that occurrence; the intended general reading makes C1 universally true.)

Answer: C1 is False (it is contradicted by the context).

Step-by-step:

1. What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
   - Events: event1 and event2.
   - Initial condition: event1 happened (explicitly stated: ""Initially, event1 happened"").

2. What are the transition rules between events?
   - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).
   - These rules say nothing that would prevent event1 from happening initially; they only constrain what can happen after either event occurs.

3. What does each sub-condition mean?
   - C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This asserts that event1 does not occur at all.

4. How do these conditions relate to each other?
   - The context asserts event1 did happen initially. C1 asserts the opposite. Therefore C1 conflicts with (is contradicted by) the context.
   - The transition rules do not rescue C1; they do not imply that event1 did not happen — they only state consequences if event1 (or event2) happens.

Conclusion: C1 is False (contradicted by the given context).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The context explicitly says ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so the statement ""Event1 does not happen"" is contradicted."

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (this is the starting point).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 → event2).
- Rule B: If event2 happens, no other events can happen afterward (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted as: in every possible execution/trace (from the given initial condition and rules), event1 occurs at some point.

4) How they relate / reasoning
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no events can occur after that initial event2. So there is no opportunity for event1 to occur after the initial state.
- Nothing in the rules forces event1 to have happened before the initial event2; the initial fact only guarantees event2 happened, not that event1 did. Therefore there exists at least one valid execution (the given initial state) in which event1 never occurs.
- Hence event1 does not occur in all executions, so ""event1 always happens"" is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event1 happens.

Step 2 — transition rules (and an explicit assumption)
- The statement gives:
  - ""After event2, event1 must happen.""
  - ""After event1, event2 must happen.""
- I will first read ""after X, Y must happen"" as an immediate next-state requirement (i.e., if X happens in some state S, then Y must happen in the very next state S+1). I’ll note an alternative (weaker) reading below.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That asks whether event1 holds in S1 (the state immediately after the initial state S0).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- Starting at S0: event1 holds (given).
- By the rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" (immediate-next interpretation), S1 must have event2.
- Therefore S1 does not have event1, so C1 is False.

Counterexample (explicit sequence): S0: event1; S1: event2; S2: event1; ... — this satisfies both transition rules and shows event1 does not hold in the next state.

Alternate interpretation (if ""after"" means ""eventually after"" rather than ""immediately""):
- If the rules only require that the other event occur at some future time (not necessarily the next state), then C1 is not guaranteed by the premises — it could be true or false depending on how the system schedules events. So under that weaker reading you cannot conclude C1 either way from the given information.

Final answer: Under the usual immediate-next interpretation, C1 is False. Under a weaker ""eventually after"" interpretation, C1 is undetermined.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially (at the start).

2) Transition/temporal rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Meaning: once event1 has occurred, no further events occur at any later time.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Meaning: if event2 occurs, it also prevents any later events. (This rule does not assert event2 actually occurs; it only constrains what would follow if it did.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" That is, there is some time (now or in the future) at which event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- You are given that event1 happened initially. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" therefore forbids any events occurring after that initial moment, which includes event2 happening later.
- The second rule (""after event2, no other events can happen"") is irrelevant unless event2 actually occurred, which we cannot have after event1 because of the first rule.
- Therefore, under the usual temporal reading, event2 does not (and cannot) eventually happen.

Alternate reading note: If one allowed event2 to have already occurred before or simultaneously with the ""initial"" event1, then C1 might be true — but the given statement ""Initially, event1 happened"" is normally taken as the starting fact, and together with ""after event1 no other events can happen"" rules out any later occurrence of event2. So with the natural interpretation, C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" forbids any subsequent events, event2 cannot occur at any later time. The second rule is irrelevant unless event2 had occurred, which it cannot after event1."

Short answer: C1 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That says whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward (i.e., event2 ⇒ event1).
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That says event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, the sequence ends.

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is exactly the implication event2 ⇒ event1.

4) How the conditions relate
- Rule A directly states event2 ⇒ event1, so C1 matches the rule and is therefore true.
- The initial fact that event2 happened only instantiates the implication (it means event1 must follow in this particular run).
- Rule B simply says that once event1 occurs nothing else can occur afterward; it does not contradict Rule A.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 will occur after it.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted as: in the given system (starting from the stated initial condition), every possible execution/run will include event2 (i.e., event2 inevitably occurs).

Step 4 — combine the facts / conclusion
- Since event1 has already happened and rule A requires that event2 must happen after event1, event2 will indeed occur. Rule B only says no events follow event2; it does not prevent event2 from occurring.
- Therefore C1 is True.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start). Nothing is said about event1 having happened initially, so we assume it has not.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is terminal: once event2 has occurred, the system permits no further events.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 would also be terminal if it were to occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Formally: there exists some time (now or in the future) at which event1 occurs.
- (If useful) C2 would be ""Event2 eventually happens"" — that is already true because event2 happened initially.
- (No other Cs were specified; interpret only what’s given.)

4) How they relate / final inference
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal (no further events can happen afterward), no other event, including event1, can occur after that initial moment.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur eventually.
- Conclusion: C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 has already occurred and, by the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" no future events (including event1) can occur; event1 did not occur initially, so it cannot eventually occur."

Step-by-step answer.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start (i.e., initially event1 happened).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen after that (event2 ⇒ event1 occurs later).
- Rule B: If event1 happens, then no other events can happen after it (event1 is terminal).

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is written as “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This is just the same proposition repeated with OR, so C1 is equivalent to the single claim “event2 happens.”

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion about C1
- Because event1 has already happened initially, Rule B forbids any further events after that. That prevents event2 from occurring at any later time.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? The context states event1 happened initially (the start point); there is no earlier time in that description, so there is no room for event2 to have happened earlier.
- Therefore, under the given reading, event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

Conclusion: C1 (“event2 happens”) is False. (If you intended a different timeline interpretation — e.g., event2 could occur before the initial point — mention that and I can re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- event1 and event2 exist.
- Initially, event1 has already happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: event2 ⇒ event1 happens afterward.
- Rule B: event1 ⇒ no other events can happen after it (event1 is terminal).

3) Interpret C1
- C1 is “event2 happens or event2 happens,” which is equivalent to “event2 happens.”

4) Trace possibilities under the given timeline
- Because event1 has already happened initially, Rule B forbids any events after that, so event2 cannot occur later.
- The problem gives no earlier time where event2 could have happened (event1 is at the start), so event2 did not occur before.

Conclusion: C1 (“event2 happens”) is False.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Short answer: C1 is False under the usual reading of ""always"". (If ""always"" were taken to mean ""occurs at least once"", then it would be True — I explain both readings below.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the initial moment (so event1 occurs at time t0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That means: if event1 has occurred, then at some later time event2 will occur (event2 is inevitable following event1).
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means: once event2 occurs, the system reaches a terminal state and neither event1 nor any other event can occur afterward.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 (given): ""Event1 always happens."" This is ambiguous:
  - Interpretation I (standard temporal logic reading): ""always"" = at every future moment (globally) event1 occurs. That reads as: for all future times t, event1 occurs at t.
  - Interpretation II (looser, sometimes used): ""always happens"" = it does occur at least once / it inevitably occurs at some point.
- No C2, C3 were provided, so I only analyze C1.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial condition and Rule A, we know event2 will occur sometime after the initial event1.
- From Rule B, once event2 occurs, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- Therefore the timeline is: t0: event1 (given) → sometime later: event2 → then termination (no more events). There is no path that has event1 occurring at every future time, nor any path where event1 occurs after event2.

Conclusion about C1:
- Under Interpretation I (""event1 happens at all times""): C1 is False. Reason: event2 must happen after the initial event1, and after event2 no events (including event1) can happen, so event1 cannot hold at all future times.
- Under Interpretation II (""event1 happens at least once / occurs at some point""): C1 is True, because the initial condition already gives that event1 happened.

If you intended a specific formal meaning for ""always"" (e.g., temporal operator G, or ""eventually""), tell me which and I will give the formal truth value and a short proof in that formalism.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Under the usual temporal-logic reading of ""always"" (i.e., holds at all future times), C1 is false: event1 occurs initially but event2 must occur later and after event2 no events (including event1) can occur, so event1 does not hold at every future time. (If ""always"" were taken to mean ""occurs at least once,"" C1 would be True.)"

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Given the initial fact that event1 happened and Rule B, the state following that initial state allows no further events. Therefore event2 cannot occur in the next state.
- Rule A is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs first; Rule B already blocks any events after event1.

Therefore C1 is False (unless you reinterpret ""next state"" to mean something other than the immediate successor of the initial state—if so, tell me how you define ""next state"" and I can re-evaluate).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — understood as “event1 never occurs” (at no time).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- The initial condition already states event1 happened, so C1 (""event1 never occurs"") is immediately contradicted.
- Additionally, the transition rules force alternation: because event1 occurred, event2 must occur later; because event2 occurs, event1 must occur again later, etc. So event1 does occur (in fact repeatedly).

- Because the initial condition already guarantees event2 occurred, C1 contradicts the given facts and cannot be true.

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0), event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules (constraints)
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Meaning: in every state strictly after the state where event1 occurred, no events (including event2) occur.
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Meaning: whenever event2 occurs, at some following point (or immediately after, depending on intended granularity) event1 must occur.

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Interpreted concretely: in the state immediately following the initial state, event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition we know event1 has already occurred. By Rule A, once event1 has occurred, no other events can happen in any later state. Therefore event2 cannot occur in the next state (or any later state).
- Rule B does not force event2 to happen; it only constrains what must follow if event2 happens. But since Rule A prevents event2 from occurring after event1, Rule B is moot here.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") contradicts Rule A and cannot be true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then event2 will occur afterward.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 will occur afterward.)

I take ""must happen"" to mean the occurrence is guaranteed (eventual or next), so each occurrence of one forces an occurrence of the other.

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1 states: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" That means both events occur (at least once) in the timeline.

Step 4 — how the facts and rules imply C1
- We start with event2 happening (given).
- By Rule B (after event2 → event1), event1 must then happen.
- Therefore both event2 (initially) and event1 (forced) happen, so the conjunction in C1 is satisfied.
- (Furthermore, once event1 happens, Rule A forces event2 again, so the two will alternate; but that is additional detail.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 follows.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (Formally: ¬event1.)
- There are no other C2/C3 given in the problem statement; the only hypothesis to evaluate is C1.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The context asserts event1 is true initially. C1 asserts the negation of that fact.
- Because the context contains the explicit fact ""event1 happened,"" C1 (¬event1) contradicts the context and therefore is false.
- Additionally, from the context and transition rules we can infer event2 happens next and nothing follows it, but those inferences do not rescue C1.

Conclusion: C1 is false (contradicted by the given initial condition).

False

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it occurred at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1 states: “Event2 does not happen.” That asserts event2 never occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- The context explicitly says event2 happened initially. That directly contradicts C1.
- The “no other events can happen” rules are irrelevant to whether event2 happened; they only restrict what can happen afterward.
- Therefore C1 (that event2 does not happen) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (this is given as the starting fact).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 ⇒ event1 occurs.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal; once it happens no further events, including repeated event1, can occur.)

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 says
- C1 is written: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens.""
- This is ambiguous in two ways:
  1. Logical/conjunctive reading: it asserts the same proposition twice (A ∧ A). That is equivalent to simply ""event1 happens.""
  2. Temporal/occurrence reading: it could be read as requiring two occurrences of event1 (event1 happens, and then event1 happens again).

Step 4 — how the rules and C1 relate, and truth value
- From the initial condition and Rule A, event1 must happen at least once. So under the logical/conjunctive reading (A ∧ A ≡ A), C1 is True.
- Under the temporal reading requiring two occurrences: Rule B says that once event1 happens no other events (including another event1) can happen, so a second occurrence is impossible; under that reading C1 is False.

Final answer
- If C1 is just the duplicated assertion ""event1 happens"" (the usual logical reading), C1 is True.
- If C1 is meant to assert two separate occurrences of event1, C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards. (event2 ⇒ later event1)
- Rule B: If event1 happens, then no other events can happen afterwards. (event1 is terminal)

3) What C1 says
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally: event1 ⇒ event2 (event1 causes or implies event2).

4) How they relate / conclusion
- The given rules do not give event1 ⇒ event2. Rule A is one-way (event2 ⇒ event1), not the converse.
- Rule B plus the fact event1 has already happened prevents any later events, so event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- A concrete model satisfying all background facts: at time 0 event1 occurs; no event2 ever occurs. This satisfies both background rules (there is no event2 to require a later event1, and after event1 nothing else happens). But it violates C1. Hence C1 is not entailed and is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The rules give event2 ⇒ later event1, not the converse; event1 is terminal and already occurs initially, so event2 need not occur (counterexample: event1 at time 0 and no event2). Hence event1 ⇒ event2 is not entailed."

Short answer: C1 is True (under the usual interpretation that “always happens” means “in every possible run starting from the given initial condition, event1 occurs at some time”).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 is required to occur at some later point.)

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Interpreted most usefully as: in every possible execution (starting from the given initial condition), event1 occurs at some time (i.e., event1 inevitably occurs).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what follows?
- We start with event2 (initial condition).
- By Rule B, because event2 occurred, event1 must occur later.
- Rule A only constrains what happens after event1 (no further events), it does not prevent event1 from occurring. Thus event1 will occur and then the execution ends.
- Therefore, in every possible execution consistent with the rules and the initial condition, event1 does occur.

Conclusion: C1 is True.

Note on alternate readings: If “always happens” were interpreted to mean “holds at every moment in time” (i.e., event1 is true at all times, even at the initial moment), that would be false because initially event2, not event1, has happened. The above conclusion assumes the natural reading that C1 asserts inevitability (event1 occurs in every run).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 happens, event1 must happen (i.e. if event2 occurs, then event1 will occur afterward).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, event2 must happen (i.e. if event1 occurs, then event2 will occur afterward).

Step 3 — what C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This is a conjunction asserting that both event2 and event1 occur (not necessarily at the same instant; ordering can matter).

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the initial event2 and Rule A, event1 must occur. 
- Once event1 occurs, Rule B requires event2 to occur (again, possibly later).
- Therefore both event2 and event1 do indeed occur. C1 is satisfied.

Answer: C1 is True (it is entailed by the initial condition plus the transition rules).

(If you mean a different formal interpretation of ""must happen"" or have additional constraints that could block events, mention them and I can re-evaluate; under the usual reading above the result stands.)

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. event1 → eventually event2).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. event2 → eventually event1).

With those two rules the system forces alternation: once one event occurs, the other must occur afterwards; starting from event2 this produces a sequence (at least under the usual reading of “after” as “at some later time”): time0: event2, time1: event1, time2: event2, time3: event1, … (possibly with arbitrary delays between occurrences, but the alternation requirement remains).

3) What the sub-condition C1 means
- You stated C1: “Event1 always happens.” This phrase can be read in different formal ways:
  a) Global (strong) reading: “event1 holds at every time point” (for all times t, event1 is true).
  b) Eventual/occurrence reading: “event1 occurs at least once (eventually happens).”
  c) Repeated/infinitely-often reading: “event1 will keep occurring forever (infinitely often).”

4) How the conditions relate and final answer about C1
- If C1 is interpreted as (a) global/always (event1 true at every moment): C1 is False. Reason: at time0 event2 happened (so event1 was not true at time0), so event1 is not true at every time.
- If C1 is interpreted as (b) “event1 occurs at least once”: C1 is True. Reason: initial event2 triggers (by rule B) that event1 must happen afterward, so event1 will happen at some later time.
- If C1 is interpreted as (c) “event1 occurs infinitely often (always reoccurs)”: C1 is True. Reason: alternation (event2 → event1 → event2 → …) guarantees event1 will keep occurring after each event2 indefinitely.

Conclusion
- Under the most literal reading of “always happens” as “true at every time point”: C1 is False.
- Under the more common informal readings “will happen (at least once)” or “will keep happening repeatedly”: C1 is True.

If you intended a specific formal meaning of “always” (e.g., LTL’s G vs. F vs. GF), tell me which one and I’ll give the verdict in that formal notation.

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (in the initial state).

2) Transition rules (given)
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, no further events occur in any later state.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs at some point, event1 must occur afterwards.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state to the initial one, event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and the conclusion
- Since event1 has already happened initially and Rule A forbids any further events after event1, no event (including event2) can occur in any later state.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur in the next state.
- So C1 is False.

Note on ambiguity: If you meant different semantics (e.g., events can occur simultaneously with event1, event1 can reoccur, or “after” in Rule B meant “before”), the conclusion could change. Under the natural reading above, C1 is definitely false.

- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur sometime afterwards).

- C1 is written as “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” That is just a conjunct of the same atomic claim twice, so it is logically equivalent to the single claim “Event2 happens.”

Step 4 — How the conditions relate and truth of C1
- From the initial fact that event1 happened and Rule A (“after event1, event2 must happen”), we conclude that event2 will happen (at some later time).
- Therefore the claim “Event2 happens” is entailed by the context, so C1 (equivalently “Event2 happens”) is True.

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So the run starts with event1 having occurred.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened the run is terminal (no further events).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Likewise, event2 would also be terminal if it ever happens.
- There is no rule requiring event2 to occur at any time.

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible execution/run, event2 occurs at some point (or equivalently, event2 occurs in the actual run starting from the given initial condition).

4) Relation of conditions and evaluation of C1
- Because the run starts with event1 and event1 forbids any subsequent events, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Therefore, under the given initial condition, there is a run (the actual one) in which event2 does not occur. Hence event2 is not guaranteed to always happen.

Caveat: If you allow simultaneous/co-occurrence at the initial moment (both event1 and event2 happening at the same initial instant), the conclusion could change. With the usual sequential reading (""Initially, event1 happened"" and then nothing else), C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already happened initially and forbids any further events, so event2 cannot occur in that run; thus ""event2 always happens"" is not guaranteed."

- Additionally, the rules create a mutual implication: event1 ⇒ event2 and event2 ⇒ event1. Once event1 occurs, event2 must occur, and after that event1 must occur again — so event1 occurs (at least initially and again thereafter).
- Therefore the hypothesis C1 is false in this system.

Note: If by C1 the user meant something else (for example ""event1 does not happen after a certain time"" or ""did not happen initially""), please clarify the intended temporal scope; under the given statements C1 is false.

Short answer: C1 is True (under the natural reading that ""always happens"" means ""will inevitably happen / eventually occur"").

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (So whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur at some later point.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal — it does not prevent itself but prevents any further events after it.)

3) What does C1 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this naturally as: in the system’s execution(s) event2 will inevitably occur (i.e., event2 occurs in every possible run/trace).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion:
- Because event1 happened initially and Rule A requires that event2 must follow event1, event2 will occur.
- Rule B (no events after event2) does not prevent event2 from occurring; it only forbids events after it.
- Thus event2 does occur in every possible execution given the premises, so C1 is True.

Note on semantics: if one instead reads ""always happens"" to mean ""is true at every moment/state"" rather than ""eventually happens,"" that would be a different claim; under that reading C1 would be false. The above conclusion assumes the usual temporal reading: event2 inevitably occurs at some point.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Since event1 has occurred and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur in every execution, event2 inevitably happens. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" doesn't prevent event2—it only forbids events after it. (If ""always"" were read as ""true at every moment,"" the answer would differ, but under the usual temporal reading ""eventually/inevitably happens,"" C1 is True.)"

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This asserts that event1 did not occur.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The initial condition explicitly states event1 happened. C1 asserts the opposite. Those two statements are contradictory.
- The additional rule about event2 being terminal is irrelevant to C1, because event2 never needs to occur to decide whether event1 happened.

Conclusion: Since the context asserts event1 happened initially, the claim ""event1 does not happen"" is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

The context explicitly states ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so the claim ""Event1 does not happen"" contradicts the given information and is therefore false. The rules about events being terminal don't change this."

Answer: C1 is False (contradicted).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

3) What C1 means
- C1 is the conjunction: ""event2 happens AND event1 happens.""
- From the initial condition we already have event1 happens (true).
- The question is whether event2 can also happen.

4) How the conditions relate and final inference
- Because event1 already happened and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no event can occur following that point — in particular event2 cannot occur after event1.
- Rule B would require event1 to occur after event2 if event2 happened. That is impossible here because event1 already occurred initially and then forbids further events.
- There is no way to place event2 before the initial event1 (the statement says event1 happened initially), so event2 cannot occur at any time without violating the rules.

Therefore event2 cannot happen, so the conjunction in C1 is false. C1 is contradicted by the given information.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already happened and Rule A makes it terminal (no events after it), so event2 cannot occur; therefore ""event2 AND event1"" is false."

Summary answer: C1 is False (contradicted). Explanation below.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events can occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => event2 would also be terminal if it ever occurred.
- There is no rule that says event2 happens at any time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 as given is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is redundant; it simplifies to ""Event2 happens.""
  (If there were C2, C3 they might be other statements, but here only C1 appears.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because the initial fact is that event1 happened and event1 is terminal, no other events can occur after that point. Therefore event2 cannot occur (it would have to occur after the initial event1).
- There is no piece of information asserting that event2 happened before event1 or simultaneously; given the typical reading of ""initially, event1 happened"" and the terminal rule, event2 cannot have happened at all.

Conclusion: C1 asserts that event2 happens. The context prevents event2 from occurring (contradiction), so C1 is false (the hypothesis is contradicted by the context).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: initially event1 happened and event1 is terminal (""after event1, no other events can happen""), so event2 cannot occur; C1 asserts event2 happens, which contradicts the context."

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the initial moment (so there is at least one occurrence of event1).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.
These rules force an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (starting with the initial event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-condition(s)
- C1 states: “Event1 does not happen.” Interpreting this in the natural way as a global claim that event1 never occurs (at no time).

4) How the conditions relate
- The initial condition directly contradicts C1 because event1 does happen initially.
- The transition rules reinforce that event1 will occur again (after the required event2), so event1 occurs at least once and in fact repeatedly.
- Therefore C1 (“event1 does not happen”) is inconsistent with the given facts and rules.

Conclusion: C1 is False. (If you meant a different scope for “does not happen” — e.g., “does not happen after the initial moment” — say so and I’ll re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen.
  - (Common reading: the immediate next state after event2 must have event1.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen.
  - (So once event1 occurs, the run ends — no further events permitted.)

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" That asserts that at the state immediately following the initial state, event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate, and conclusion about C1
- From the initial state we know event2 already happened. By Rule A, the next state (the state after event2) must have event1. By Rule B, once event1 occurs there can be no further events. Therefore the next state must contain event1, not event2. So C1 (that event2 happens in the next state) is false — it is not entailed and in fact contradicts the given rules under the usual interpretation that ""after"" means the immediate next state.

(If you adopt a different semantics where ""after"" only means ""eventually"" rather than ""immediately,"" the context still does not entail that event2 will occur in the next state; at best it would be possible but not guaranteed. Under either interpretation, C1 is not entailed, so answer = False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 already occurred in the initial state. By the rules, the immediate next state must contain event1, and after event1 no further events can occur — so event2 cannot (and is not required to) happen in the next state."

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial time, event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1 is terminal: once it occurs, the run stops.)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (event2 is also terminal.)

So each event, if it occurs, prevents any further events from occurring afterwards.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" That means there exists some time at or after the initial moment when event1 occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event2 has already happened in the initial state and event2 is terminal (""after event2, no other events can happen""), no further events can occur after the initial moment. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- The only way event1 could be true is if it had already happened at or before the initial moment (or simultaneously at the initial moment). But if event1 had already happened before event2, that would contradict ""after event1, no other events can happen"" because event2 is known to have happened. Simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment would need to be explicitly allowed; the given statements do not indicate that.

Conclusion: Under the usual reading (linear time, no simultaneous occurrence unless stated), event1 does not eventually happen. C1 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (initially event2 happened).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (From the fact that event2 happened, event1 is required to occur at some later point.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 occurs, the run ends — no further events occur afterwards.)

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is written as ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is ambiguous:
  - Interpretation (a) C1 is just the proposition ""event1 happens"" written twice (a trivial duplication). Under this reading C1 is equivalent to “event1 happens.”
  - Interpretation (b) C1 is intended to mean “event1 happens twice” (two occurrences at different times), i.e. a conjunction requiring two occurrences.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the conclusion
- From the initial condition and Rule A, event1 must occur at least once after the initial event2. So “event1 happens” is guaranteed.
- From Rule B, once event1 occurs, no further events happen after it. Thus there is exactly one occurrence of event1 (one guaranteed occurrence, and no additional events after it).

Conclusion
- Under interpretation (a) (C1 is just a duplicated statement meaning “event1 happens”), C1 is True.
- Under interpretation (b) (C1 requires two occurrences of event1), C1 is False, because once event1 occurs no further events can occur, so a second occurrence cannot follow.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: reading C1 as the conjunction of the same proposition twice (A and A) is equivalent to A. From the initial event2 and Rule A, event1 must occur, so the proposition is true. (If instead C1 were intended to require two distinct occurrences of event1, that would be false.)"

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: ""Initially, event2 happened"" — so event2 did occur (at least once, at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, no further events occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" — if event2 occurs, then event1 will (or must) occur afterward.

3) Meaning of the sub-condition C1
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreting this as the claim that event2 never happens (or that event2 did not happen).

4) Relation of conditions and final judgement
- The initial condition explicitly states event2 happened. That directly contradicts C1. The transition rules do not negate the initial occurrence of event2; they only constrain what must follow (event1 must follow, and then nothing else).
- Therefore C1 is false under the given information.

Note on ambiguity: If C1 were intended to mean “event2 does not happen after some later time” or some restricted-time claim, we would need that temporal frame. With the usual reading (event2 does not happen at all / did not happen), C1 is false.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards (at least at some later point).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — whenever event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards.
(If “after” means “in the next step” this is a next-state implication; if it means “eventually after” it is an eventuality implication. Either way they are mutual obligations.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 as given: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction; it is logically equivalent to ""event2 happens."" (There is no additional meaning in repeating the same disjunct.)
- You mentioned C2, C3 but did not define them; I can interpret or analyze them if you give their definitions.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event1 holds initially and the rules require that after any event1 occurs, event2 must occur, event2 must occur (at least once after the initial event1).
- Once event2 occurs, the other rule ensures event1 must occur again, and so on; the two rules form a mutual implication that forces the two events to alternate (or both continually reoccur), depending on your temporal interpretation.

- C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Given the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will indeed happen. Therefore C1 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Since event1 holds initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur, C1 is satisfied."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is given as the starting fact).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 happens, then event1 will happen afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal — nothing follows it.)

Step 3 — what the sub-condition(s) mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" It asserts both that event2 occurred and that event1 occurred (in that order, given the context).
- (No C2, C3 were provided; if there are others, please supply them and I can interpret them similarly.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- We are given event2 happened initially.
- By Rule A, once event2 has happened, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 did happen.
- Both parts of C1 (event2 happened and event1 happened) are satisfied.
- Rule B (no events after event1) does not contradict C1.

Conclusion: C1 is True (given the stated initial condition and transition rules).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial time (call it t0) event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Meaning: whenever event1 occurs at some time t, there is a later time t' > t at which event2 occurs (event2 is inevitable after event1).
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Meaning: once event2 has occurred, the system produces no further events (event2 is terminal).

From these rules and the initial condition we get a canonical timeline: event1 at t0, event2 at some t1 > t0, and no events after t1.

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is stated as ""Event1 always happens.""
  - Interpretation 1 (strict/global): ""always"" = at every time point (globally true). That reads as: for every time t, event1 holds at t.
  - Interpretation 2 (lax/eventual): ""always"" = ""always occurs at least once"" or ""event1 inevitably happens sometime"" (often written as “eventually event1”).
  - Interpretation 3 (across runs): ""in all runs/traces of the system event1 occurs"" (universal occurrence across behaviors).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and verdict on C1
- Using the given facts we deduce that event1 does happen at t0 (initially), and then event2 must happen later and stops further events. So event1 occurs at least once (at t0), but does not necessarily hold at times after t1.
- Therefore:
  - If C1 is interpreted as Interpretation 1 (event1 holds at every time point): C1 is False. Counterexample: at times after event2, no events occur, so event1 is not true at those later times.
  - If C1 is interpreted as Interpretation 2 (event1 occurs at least once / eventually): C1 is True because it did occur initially.
  - If C1 is interpreted as Interpretation 3 (in all runs event1 occurs): given the stated initial condition ""Initially, event1 happened,"" that implies event1 occurs in the run(s) considered, so C1 is True under that reading.

Most natural reading of ""Event1 always happens"" in temporal/logical problems is the strict/global one (holds at all times). Under that reading C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Under the usual global reading of ""always"" (holds at every time), event1 does not hold after event2 occurs, so C1 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (start) event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: after any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur next.
- Rule B: after any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur next.
Together these force alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — meaning of C1
- C1 is stated as “Event1 always happens.” This needs a clarity of interpretation:
  - Interpretation (i) ""always"" = at every time/step (for all moments, event1 holds).  
  - Interpretation (ii) ""always"" = event1 eventually happens (at least once).  
  - Interpretation (iii) ""always"" = event1 happens infinitely often.

Step 4 — relate the rules to C1 and conclusion
- Timeline implied by the rules: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...
- Under interpretation (i): False. event1 does not hold at times when event2 occurs (e.g. t0, t2…), so it is not true at every time.
- Under interpretation (ii): True. event1 does occur (at t1).
- Under interpretation (iii): True. event1 occurs infinitely often (at every odd step).

Final answer (most natural reading)
- If ""always happens"" is taken in the usual sense “at every time/step,” then C1 is False.

Short answer: C1 is True, under the usual interpretation that “Event1 always happens” means “in every possible run (from the given initial condition) event1 occurs at some point.” Below is the step‑by‑step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened (the system starts in a state after event2).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (So any execution that has just had event2 is required to have event1 next/at some subsequent step.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal: once it occurs, the trace ends—no further events are possible.)

3) What does the sub-condition C1 mean?
- C1 is given as “Event1 always happens.” The natural reading in this kind of modal/temporal context is: “In every run (from the stated initial condition) event1 occurs at some point (i.e. event1 inevitably happens).”
- Note on ambiguity: if one reads “always happens” as “is occurring at every instant” then that would be a different (stronger) meaning and is not what’s normally intended here.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- From the initial condition we have event2.
- Rule A forces event1 after event2. Therefore starting from the given initial state, event1 must occur.
- Rule B only says that once event1 happens nothing else happens afterward; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.
- Therefore, in every run that starts with “initially event2,” event1 does indeed occur. So C1 (under the usual interpretation) is True.

If you intended a different formal reading of “always happens,” tell me which and I’ll re-evaluate under that semantics.

Answer: C1 is True (entailed).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: if event2 occurs, then eventually event1 occurs (event2 ⇒ event1).
- Rule B: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Interpreted as: if event1 occurs, then eventually event2 occurs (event1 ⇒ event2).

3) What the hypothesis C1 means
- C1 = ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" That is the conjunction: (event2 occurs at some time) AND (event1 occurs at some time).

4) How the conditions relate and final inference
- We already have event1 happening initially (so the second conjunct ""event1 happens"" is satisfied).
- From rule B (event1 ⇒ event2) and the initial event1, event2 must happen (so the first conjunct is satisfied).
- Once event2 happens, rule A would require event1 again, but that only reinforces that event1 happens (it already did). In every timeline consistent with the rules and the initial condition both events occur.

Therefore C1 is true (entailed by the given information).

Short answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 has happened (the timeline begins with event1).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal/absorbing.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward).

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted naturally as: in every possible execution/timeline from the initial state, event2 occurs (at least once).

4) How the conditions interact → conclusion
- The initial state already has event1. By Rule A, once event1 has happened, no further events can happen. Therefore no event (including event2) can occur after the initial event1.
- There is no way for event2 to have happened before the initial event1 (the initial condition fixes the start of the timeline).
- Hence event2 cannot occur in any execution starting from the given initial condition. So it is false that event2 always happens (in fact it never happens).

Therefore C1 is False. (If you intended a different meaning of ""initially"" or ""always happens,"" tell me and I can re-evaluate.)

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. event2 → event1 next).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e. event1 → event2 next).
So the rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3) What C1 means
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreted in the natural way as a global claim that event2 never occurs (or does not occur now/ever).

4) How the conditions relate
- The initial condition explicitly states event2 did happen, so C1 already contradicts the given facts.
- Furthermore, the transition rules guarantee event2 will continue to occur (after event1), so the claim that event2 does not happen is incompatible with the dynamics.

Conclusion: C1 is false (inconsistent with the initial condition and the transition rules). If ""does not happen"" were intended to mean ""does not happen at some specific time,"" you would need to specify the time; but under the usual reading (never happens / contradicting the initial fact), C1 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial condition states event2 happened, so ""event2 does not happen"" is already contradicted. The transition rules (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...) further ensure event2 occurs again, so C1 is false."

Answer: C1 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward (event2 → event1 later).
- Rule B: If event1 happens, no other events can happen afterward (event1 is terminal).

3) What C1 means
- C1 = “event1 happens and event2 happens” — both events occur at some times.

4) How these relate / why C1 is false
- Because event1 has already happened initially and rule B says no events can occur after an event1, no other event (including event2) can occur at any later time. So event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No: “initially event1 happened” places event1 at the start, so there is no earlier time for event2.
- Simultaneity doesn't rescue C1: rule A requires event1 to occur after event2, which is incompatible with event1 already being initial; and rule B forbids any event after event1.

Therefore it is impossible for both event1 and event2 to have happened under the given rules and initial condition. C1 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: “Initially, event1 happened.” That is, at the start/initial state event1 has occurred.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., once event1 has happened, event2 will occur afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 leads to a terminal state).
- Putting these together yields the simple possible trace: event1 (initial) → event2 → end. No other events can occur after event2.

Step 3 — what C1 (“Event1 always happens”) can mean, and evaluation
This statement is ambiguous unless we fix the intended meaning of “always.”

- Interpretation A (temporal/global): “Event1 always happens” = event1 holds at every moment (in temporal-logic notation: globally G event1). Under this reading the claim is false: event1 occurs initially, but after event1 the system moves on to event2 and then to a terminal state where event1 need not (and typically does not) hold at later times. So G event1 is not guaranteed.

- Interpretation B (trace-occurrence): “Event1 always happens” = in every execution/trace event1 occurs at least once (i.e., event1 occurs on every run). Under this reading the claim is true, because the specification explicitly says “Initially, event1 happened,” which makes event1 present in every run’s beginning.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate
- The initial condition guarantees event1 occurs at the start of every execution.
- The “after event1, event2 must happen” rule forces event2 to occur sometime after that initial event1.
- The “after event2 no other events can happen” rule makes the trace finite: event1 then event2 then termination.
- So the system guarantees event1 occurs in every run (it’s initial), but it does not guarantee event1 holds at all times after the initial moment.

Final answer (C1: Event1 always happens)
- If by “always happens” you mean “occurs at least once in every execution” → True.
- If you mean “holds at every timepoint / globally” → False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the initial condition fixes event1 as having occurred in every execution (so event1 occurs on all runs). (If instead “always” meant “holds at every timepoint” then that stronger reading would be false.)"

- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards. (event1 -> event2)
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — what the sub-condition C1 means
- C1 is: ""Event2 does not happen."" Read straightforwardly, C1 asserts that event2 never happens (or at least that event2 does not happen in the situation being described).

(There are no C2, C3 given in the problem. If you intended other conditions, please supply them and I can interpret them likewise.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and verdict on C1
- The context explicitly states that event2 happened initially. That directly contradicts C1.
- Therefore C1 is false: the context entails that event2 did happen, so the statement ""event2 does not happen"" cannot be true. (The transition rules do not rescue C1 — they only add constraints consistent with event2 having occurred.)

Conclusion: C1 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the context states event2 happened initially, so the claim ""event2 does not happen"" is contradicted."
