- Because event2 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids any events from occurring afterward. Thus event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" That asks whether event2 occurs in the immediate successor state.

Step 2 — Examine the given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so the initial state already has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This means that once event2 has happened, the system has no further events — i.e., no transitions that produce events occur after that.)

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Since event2 already happened initially and after event2 no events can happen, there are no further events that can occur in any successor state. Therefore the next state cannot have an occurrence of event2 (or any event).

Conclusion
- The hypothesis that event2 happens in the next state is false.

- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 occurs, it is terminal.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs, it is terminal.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Because event2 happened initially, the ""after event2, no other events can happen"" condition means no events can occur after that initial moment.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- Could event1 have occurred before the initial event2? No — the context says event2 happened initially, i.e. at the start; nothing happened before that.
- The only remaining subtlety is simultaneous occurrence at the initial moment. The usual reading of ""Initially, event2 happened"" treats that as the single initial event; the additional constraints use ""after"" (strictly later), so simultaneous coexistence is not implied.

Reasoning:
- Since event1 already happened initially, rule (2) forbids any events from occurring after that point. Therefore event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No: ""initially, event1 happened"" places event1 at the start; there is no earlier time for event2 to have occurred.

- After event2, event1 must happen. (Any occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Any occurrence of event1 is followed by an occurrence of event2.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event1 happened initially, the condition ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces an event2 to occur later.

   - After Event1, Event2 must happen. (So given the occurrence of Event1, Event2 is required to occur subsequently.)

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred at the initial state.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means once event2 has occurred there can be no subsequent events in any later state.
- After event1, event2 must happen. This only constrains sequences where event1 occurs; it does not force event1 to occur now or in the future.

Trace possibilities:
- Since event2 already happened initially, the requirement that ""after event2 no other events can happen"" prevents event2 (or any event) from occurring in the next state.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant for making event2 occur in the next state, because event1 cannot occur after event2, and event2 already occurred initially.

Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen in the next state.

- Since event1 has already happened initially, Rule A requires that event2 occur (event2 must happen after that event1).
- Once event2 occurs, Rule B requires event1 occur again, and then Rule A requires event2 again, and so on. This yields an alternating sequence event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 ... but the key point is that event2 does occur following the initial event1.

- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences (optional)
- From the initial event2, the rule ""after event2 → event1"" implies event1 will occur at some point.
- Once event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1 → event2"" makes event2 occur again, possibly creating a cycle. In any case, event1 does occur in this system.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- In classical logic the implication A → A is a tautology: it is always true (whether A is false, true, or cyclic). Here, given the system, event1 does occur, so the antecedent and consequent are both true; even without that, A → A remains true by logic.

- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 occurs, the system becomes terminal.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 has occurred, event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Because event2 happened initially, the requirement ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur sometime after the initial moment.
- When event1 occurs, ""no other events can happen"" holds, so the sequence can be: event2 (initial) → event1 → stop. This is consistent with all constraints.

- Condition B prevents any events after that initial event2, so event1 cannot occur anywhere (there is no opportunity for it to occur after the initial event2).

- One valid sequence satisfying the constraints is: initial state: event2; next state: nothing (or some other events); later: event1; then later: event2; etc. Another valid sequence is the immediate alternation: event2 → event1 in next state → event2 next, etc. Both satisfy the ""must happen"" requirements.

- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- Since event1 happened initially, by Rule B event2 must happen (so event2 does occur at least once).
- Given the two rules, event1 and event2 imply each other and will occur (possibly alternating), but that's not needed to evaluate C1.

Step 4 — Evaluate the hypothesis
- The statement event2 → event2 is a logical tautology (an instance of p → p). It is true in every situation, regardless of the context.
- Additionally, the context actually guarantees event2 occurs, but even if it did not, the implication p → p remains true.

- “Event2 always happens” I take to mean: in every possible execution (every allowed event sequence) event2 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So every execution begins with event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, the run stops — no further events (including event1) can occur after that.
- “After event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant here because event1 can never occur after the initial event2, and there is no room before the initial event2 for event1 (the initial event is event2).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The only allowed sequence consistent with the premises is: event2 occurs initially, and then nothing else happens.
- Therefore every possible execution includes event2 (it happens at the start).

- Under the natural reading that “always happens” means “occurs in every execution,” the claim is True.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" This means event1 has already occurred at the start.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Once event1 has happened, the system has no further events.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This is a constraint about sequences containing event2, requiring event1 afterwards.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially, event1 has already occurred, so the requirement ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied immediately.
- The second condition (no events after event1) prevents any events following the initial event1, so event2 cannot occur after that. Whether event2 could occur before the initial moment is not consistent with ""initially, event1 happened"" (initial means first), so event2 never occurs in any valid run. The third condition is therefore irrelevant for the truth of C1.

- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true in the initial state of every execution.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen. This requires that if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur later.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event2 happened initially, every execution has event2 at the start.
- Since event2 already happened, the ""no other events after event2"" rule blocks any subsequent events; thus event1 can never occur.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied because event1 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In every valid execution event2 occurs (at the initial moment), so ""Event2 always happens"" is true.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 says “Event1 does not happen.”
- Given: initially event2 happened. Also, “after event2, no other events can happen,” so once that initial event2 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event1) can occur.
- The rule “after event1, event2 must happen” is only a conditional that applies if event1 occurs; it does not force event1 to occur.
- Therefore, with event2 already having happened initially and forbidding any later events, event1 does not happen.

- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot actually occur in any timeline starting from the given initial state.
- In logic, an implication ""if A then B"" is true either when A never happens (vacuously true) or when, whenever A does happen, B follows.
- Here we also have an explicit rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" which directly asserts the implication event1 → event2.

- Since event2 has already occurred and that triggers a requirement that event1 must happen afterward, the only consistent sequences must include event1 at some later point.
- There is no condition that blocks or contradicts event1 happening. The prohibition on further events after event1 does not stop event1 itself.

Conclusion
- Therefore C1 is True."

""C1: Event2 always happens"" means: in every possible sequence consistent with the given rules, event2 occurs now and at all required future points (i.e., it will keep occurring as required by the rules).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred at least once).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so every occurrence of event2 is followed later by an occurrence of event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so every occurrence of event1 is followed later by an occurrence of event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event2 occurs (given).
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", some later time must have event1.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", some later time must have event2.
- Those new occurrences again trigger the same obligations, forcing event1 then event2 again, and so on.

Thus the rules force an alternating (potentially infinite) sequence ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ... so event2 occurs initially and then recurs indefinitely.

- After event2, event1 must happen. This enforces that following event2, event1 will occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen. This makes event1 terminal but does not prevent event1 itself.

Step 3 — trace possible executions
- Start: event2 occurs (given).
- By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur next (or at least sometime after).
- Once event1 occurs, execution stops (no further events), but event1 has indeed occurred.

Conclusion
- Given the initial event2 and the mandatory successor rule, event1 necessarily occurs in every execution. Therefore C1 is True.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So at the start of the timeline, event2 has occurred.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs at some time, then a subsequent event2 must occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal: nothing can occur after any event2.)

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- The timeline begins with event2 (initial event2).
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, nothing can occur after that initial event2 — so event1 cannot occur after it.
- Could event1 have occurred before the initial event2? The statement ""Initially, event2 happened"" sets event2 as the starting event; there is no information mandating any earlier event1. The rules do not force that event1 occurred before the initial event2.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- There is no requirement that event1 ever occurs; indeed, given the initial event2 and the terminal nature of event2, event1 cannot occur after the start and is not guaranteed to have occurred before it.

- The hypothesis asserts ""Event1 happens"" (repeated twice, but that’s equivalent to a single claim that event1 happens). We must decide if that follows from the context.

Step 2 — Interpret the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the start, event2 has occurred.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event2 must follow.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur.)

Step 3 — Reasoning about event1:
- Because event2 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" prevents any additional events from occurring after that point.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- There is no information that event1 happened before the initial state; the context states the initial event was event2, so event1 did not happen.

Conclusion:
- The hypothesis that event1 happens is not supported and cannot be true given the context.

- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred.
- After event1, event2 must happen. That is a requirement: sometime after the occurrence of event1, event2 must occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen. This makes event2 terminal but does not forbid event2 itself.

2. Trace:
- Since event1 has occurred initially, the requirement ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur at some later point.
- When event2 occurs, the third condition only restricts subsequent events (none may occur), which is consistent and does not prevent event2 from occurring.

- Also given: after event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur thereafter.
- Nothing states event1 had already occurred initially. Therefore there is at least one valid execution (the given initial state) in which event1 does not occur.
- Because event1 does not occur in that execution, it is not true that event1 always happens.

- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" — if event1 occurs, event2 follows.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — the run stops after event2.

Step 3 — Reasoning about entailment:
- The context guarantees that in the described initial run, event1 did happen (so in that run event1 occurs).
- However, ""always happens"" is a stronger claim (universal/necessary) that is not supported by the context: the text gives a fact about the initial/this run only and does not state that in every possible run or at all times event1 must occur.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (at least eventually) after that initial event2.
- Once event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur again.
- That in turn forces event1 again, and so on. The two rules create an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

- Initially (state 0): event1 happened.
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That requires that in the state immediately following any state where event1 occurred, event2 occurs.
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That requires that in the state immediately following any state where event2 occurred, event1 occurs.

Step 3 — trace from the initial state
- At state 0 event1 happened. By Rule A, state 1 must have event2.
- Therefore event2 must occur in the next state (state 1).
- That requirement prevents the necessity of event1 in state 1; the rules force event2 in state 1, not event1.

- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → later event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred, the sequence ends).

Step 2 — examine consequences:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no events can occur after the initial moment — in particular, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" does not imply the converse (event2 implies event1). So the initial occurrence of event2 does not tell us event1 occurred beforehand.
- There is no rule forcing event1 to have happened before the initial event2, and the initial condition states event2 happened at the start, so we cannot deduce event1 ever occurs.

- The other condition (""After event2, no other events can happen"") is irrelevant here because event2 must occur after event1 would block it.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Since event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur later.
- Event2 could only have occurred before event1 or simultaneously, but the context states event1 happened initially, so there is no prior time where event2 could have occurred. Simultaneous occurrence is not supported by the given statements.

- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1, if it occurs, is terminal — it does not forbid event1 itself, only forbids any events after it.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, an event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Since event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" requires that event1 occurs sometime after event2.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event1 from occurring after event2; it only prevents events after event1.

- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means any occurrence of event2 must be followed by event1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.

Step 3 — reason about possible traces:
- We have a trace where event1 happens initially. Because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur after that initial event1.
- Nothing in the context forces event2 to have occurred before the initial event1, so there exists at least one allowed trace with event1 but without event2.

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal but not forbidden).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Since event2 has already happened initially, the requirement ""after event2, event1 must happen"" applies and forces an occurrence of event1 at some later point.
- The constraint ""after event1, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event1 from occurring; it only stops further events after it.
- There is no allowed execution that contains the initial event2 but omits event1, because the ""after event2"" requirement mandates event1.

- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" We already know event1 happens (it’s given initially), so the only question is whether event2 can also happen.

- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 occurred at the start.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events are allowed.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.

Step 3 — trace possible event orderings
- event1 has already occurred initially, so anything that must happen after event1 is impossible (no events can occur after it).
- For event2 to occur it would have to occur either before or after event1.
  - It cannot occur after event1 (no events allowed after event1).
  - It cannot occur before event1 because the context says event1 happened initially (the initial state already contains event1), so there is no earlier time for event2 to have occurred.
- If event2 did occur at any time, rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" requires event1 to occur after event2. But event1 already occurred initially, so that ordering would be violated unless event1 could happen again after event2, which is disallowed by ""no events after event1.""

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 cannot occur at any time consistent with the conditions. Therefore ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" is not satisfiable.

- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so any occurrence of Event2 requires a subsequent Event1).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- Since Event1 happened initially and no events can happen after Event1, there is no time after the initial Event1 for any other event to occur.
- Event2 cannot occur after Event1 because ""no other events can happen"" after Event1.
- Event2 cannot occur before Event1 because ""initially Event1 happened"" means Event1 is the starting event (no earlier events exist).
- The rule ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"" would also require Event1 to follow any Event2, but Event1 already occurs initially and blocks any events after it, so there is no consistent place for Event2 to occur at all.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 does not (and cannot) always happen; indeed it cannot occur in any valid sequence given the conditions.

- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 will occur again after event1, and this can repeat.)

Step 3 — Reason about possibilities:
- The first condition already asserts that event2 did happen initially. Therefore the statement ""event2 does not happen"" is contradicted immediately.

C1 claims both event1 and event2 occur.

- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, an event1 must follow it.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Any occurrence of event1 is terminal: nothing can occur afterward.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
Because event1 occurs initially and after any event1 no further events can occur, no events can occur after that initial event1. Therefore event2 cannot occur later. It also cannot occur before the initial event1 because the initial event1 is the first event.

Event2 cannot happen given these constraints, so the conjunction ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" is not satisfiable.

- C1 asserts: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible execution/trace, event1 occurs).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" — event1 has already occurred in the initial state (so every allowed trace starts with event1).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" — event2 inevitably follows event1.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — event2 is terminal; there is no alternative branch that omits event1.

Step 3 — Trace possible event sequences
- The only consistent sequence is: event1 (initial) → event2 → stop. There is no sequence allowed by the premises in which event1 does not occur.

Conclusion
- Given the premises, event1 occurs in every possible trace; therefore C1 is True.
