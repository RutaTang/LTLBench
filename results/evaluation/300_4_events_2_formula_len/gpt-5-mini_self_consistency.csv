Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions (transitions)
- Initially: event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (1 → 2)
- After event2, next is one of {1,3,4}. (2 → {1,3,4})
- After event3, next is one of {1,4}. (3 → {1,4})
- After event4, next must be 3. (4 → 3)

Step 3 — trace from the initial state
- We start at event1. By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 will occur next. So event2 does eventually happen (indeed immediately after the initial event).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 is true (event2 does eventually happen).
- Therefore the disjunction ""event2 happens or C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, one of {event1, event4} must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event1 has already happened initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 will occur (immediately next).
- Therefore event2 does eventually happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (and in fact C2 is equivalent to C1 in this setting).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is True or False.
- C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace events:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" forces that, immediately after the initial event1, event2 occurs.
- Therefore event2 does indeed happen (in fact it happens next), so C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (and in this setting event2 actually happens anyway).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
C2: If event3 happens, then C1 holds. C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" So C2 asserts: event3 → (event1 ∨ event2).

Step 2 — Examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 occurs at least initially).
- event2 → event4 (after event2, event4 must happen).
- event4 → event2 (after event4, event2 must happen).
- event1 → event4.
- event3 → (event2 or event4).

Step 3 — Trace possibilities after event3:
- If event3 → event2 directly, then (event1 ∨ event2) is true because event2 holds.
- If event3 → event4, then by event4 → event2, event2 must happen afterward. So again (event1 ∨ event2) is true.

In every possible branch triggered by event3, event2 occurs, so C1 holds.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., event3 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2))

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 has occurred at least once.)
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason through consequences
- Because event2 happened initially, C1 (""event1 or event2"") is already true (event2 occurred).
- Therefore any implication with C1 as consequent is true regardless of whether event3 happens. So event3 ⇒ C1 holds.
- Alternatively, even if you reason only about what follows event3: after event3 either event2 or event4 happens. If event2 happens then C1 holds directly. If event4 happens then, by ""after event4, event2 must happen,"" event2 will happen after that, so C1 holds anyway. Thus event3 guarantees event2 (possibly after an intervening event4), so C1 holds.

Final answer: True
---
We need to check whether the context entails: (event3 → (event1 ∨ event2)).

Given conditions:
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen. So: event3 → (event2 ∨ event4).
- After event4, event2 must happen. So: event4 → event2.

From these two, if event3 happens then either event2 happens directly, or event4 happens and hence event2 happens. Thus event3 → event2. Therefore event3 → (event1 ∨ event2) holds (since event2 makes the disjunction true).

So C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2: ""If C1 holds (Event2 always happens), then event4 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen. (So event4 is required due to the initial event1.)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- From ""Initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1, event4 must happen"", event4 will occur regardless of anything else.
- Therefore, even if C1 (event2 always happens) holds, event4 already must happen because of the initial event1.

Conclusion
- The implication in C2 is guaranteed. Final answer: True
---
First identify the claim: C2 says ""If C1 holds (event2 always happens), then event4 happens."" We must decide if that implication is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Examine the premises:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.

From these two premises alone, event4 must occur in every allowed sequence (it is forced immediately after the initial event1). That makes event4 true regardless of whether C1 (event2 always happens) holds or not.

Thus whenever C1 holds, event4 also holds (indeed event4 holds unconditionally). Therefore the implication in C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds (event2 always happens), then event4 happens.""

Step 2 — review the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen. (unconditional)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Because event1 initially happened and the rule ""after event1, event4 must happen"" is unconditional, event4 will occur in every behavior allowed by the premises.
- Whether or not event2 ""always happens"" (C1) is irrelevant: event4 is already forced by the initial event1.

Conclusion
- In every model consistent with the context (including those where C1 holds), event4 happens. Thus C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1 says: ""Event2 happens and event4 happens"" (E2 ∧ E4).
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" i.e. (E2 ∧ E4) → E2.

Step 2 — Examine conditions / feasibility
- From the given rules, starting with event3 you can have a sequence 3 → 2 → 4, so C1 is feasible (both E2 and E4 can occur).
- But C2 is a logical implication about C1, not about feasibility.

Step 3 — Logical evaluation
- The implication (E2 ∧ E4) → E2 is a tautology: whenever E2 and E4 are both true, E2 is certainly true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""event2 happens and event4 happens"" (event2 ∧ event4).
- C2 says ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — formally (event2 ∧ event4) → event2.
- A conjunction implies each of its conjuncts, so from (event2 ∧ event4) we can infer event2 directly.
- This is true regardless of the background event rules, so C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""Event2 happens and Event4 happens"" (i.e. A ∧ B).
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then Event2 happens"" (i.e. (A ∧ B) → A).
- The implication (A ∧ B) → A is a logical tautology: whenever A ∧ B is true, A is necessarily true.
- Therefore C2 is true regardless of the rest of the context (even if C1 never actually occurs)."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 holds in every model.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" This is the statement we must evaluate.

Step 2 — what the context gives us
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event4 happened."" So event4 is true (it actually happened).

Step 3 — combine them
- C1 is true (tautology).
- Event4 is true (given by the context).
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is true (both antecedent and consequent are true). In fact, since event4 is already true, C2 would be true regardless of C1.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the claim: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens.""

Step 2 — check C1:
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" That is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 holds (is true).

Step 3 — check whether event4 happens:
- The context states “Initially, event4 happened.” So event4 does indeed happen (at least initially).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- The antecedent of C2 (C1 holds) is true, and the consequent (event4 happens) is also true, so the implication C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True.

Reasoning:
- C1 is the formula (event1 → event1), which is a tautology (always true) so C1 holds.
- C2 states: if C1 holds then event4 happens. Since C1 does hold, C2 asserts that event4 happens.
- The context already gives that event4 happened initially, so event4 is true.

Therefore C2 is true."

- After event3, event1 must happen → sequence: 4 → 3 → 1. So event1 does occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen → sequence continues: 4 → 3 → 1 → 2. So event2 also occurs.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen; either choice leads back to the cycle (3 → 1 → 2 …), so both event1 and event2 continue to occur infinitely often.

   - Initially event4 happened.
   - After event4, event3 must happen → sequence: 4 → 3.
   - After event3, event1 must happen → sequence: 4 → 3 → 1. So Event1 does eventually happen. Therefore C1 holds.
   - After event1, event2 must happen → sequence continues 4 → 3 → 1 → 2. So Event2 also happens.
   - After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen, which leads back into the same cycle (and in either branch event1 will occur again).

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event1 always happens.""
- From the context: initially Event1 happens. After Event1 either Event3 or Event4 must happen. After Event4 no other events can happen (terminal).
- Consider the valid sequence: Event1 → Event4. This sequence obeys the rules but after the Event4 step there are no further events, so Event1 does not ""always"" occur at every subsequent point.
- Because there exists a legal trace where Event1 does not continue to occur, C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After any event1, the next event must be either event3 or event4.
- If event3 happens, event1 must happen afterwards, producing a cycle event1 → event3 → event1 → ...
- But after any event1 the alternative is event4, and after event4 no further events can occur (termination).
- Therefore there exists a valid execution: initial event1, then choose event4. That execution stops and event1 does not continue to occur thereafter.
- Because there is a possible execution in which event1 does not ""always happen,"" the statement C1 (""Event1 always happens"") does not hold universally.

Thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/time).
- From the context: initially event1 happens, and after event1 either event3 or event4 must happen.
- Take the allowed sequence: event1 (initial) → event4. When event4 happens, event1 does not hold at that step, and after event4 no further events occur.
- Thus there is a reachable point where event1 is false, so ""event1 always happens"" is false.
- Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds.
- C1 is: ""Event3 always happens."" So C2 is claiming that in every allowed execution, event3 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event3 happened."" So in every execution, event3 has already occurred at the start.
- After event3, no other events can happen. Therefore every execution terminates immediately after that initial event3; no alternate initial events or later events can avoid that initial event3.

Step 3 — reasoning about C1 and C2:
- Because event3 happens initially in every execution, event3 does indeed always happen (it occurs in every allowed run).
- Therefore C1 is true in all executions, so C1 always holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., it is always true that Event3 always happens)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- The other rules (what can follow event1 or event2) never get a chance to fire because event3 blocks further events.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- The only possible sequence is: event3 occurs initially, then nothing else (because after event3 no events can happen).

Step 4 — conclude
- In every possible execution/event sequence, event3 occurs (indeed it occurs initially), so C1 is true in all executions.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — i.e., in every possible execution/run of the system, event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., the statement C1 is true for the system (equivalently: in every execution C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened (so every execution starts with event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (so any execution that begins with event3 ends there; no further events are possible).
- Other rules (after event2 → ... , after event1 → ...) are irrelevant because event2 or event1 cannot occur once event3 has happened and no further events are allowed.

Step 3 — trace possible executions
- The only possible execution is: event3 occurs initially, then nothing else.
- In that execution event3 does occur (indeed it occurs at the start).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is true (event3 occurs in every possible execution).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

- After event4, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules about events 1, 2, 3 are irrelevant if no events can occur after event4.)

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Since event4 happened initially and no events can occur after event4, event1 can never occur at any later time. Therefore C1 is false.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event1 does not eventually happen). We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
- The other rules (after event2 → event1 or event3; after event1 → event3; after event3 → event1) only matter if those events can occur, but they cannot override the rule about event4.

Step 3 — reason about event sequences:
- Since event4 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event4, no subsequent events (including event1) can ever occur.
- There is no information that event1 occurred before the initial state, so we may not assume event1 happens at any point.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (Event1 does not eventually happen), so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step reasoning

1. The timeline begins with event4 having happened (initially event4 happened).
2. The rule ""After event4, no other events can happen"" means no events occur after that initial event4.
3. Therefore there is no possibility for event1 to occur at any later time (and event1 did not occur before, since the initial event was event4).
4. So ""Event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is false.
5. C2 states C1 does not hold, which is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- Initially event4 happened (given).
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must occur.
  - If event3 occurs next, then ""after event3, no other events can happen"" — sequence ends, so event2 cannot occur.
  - If event1 occurs next, then ""after event1, event3 must happen"" — so event3 will occur and, again, after event3 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur.
- In all possible continuations starting from the given initial event4, event3 will occur and then no further events can occur; therefore event2 cannot happen. So C1 (event2 does not happen) is true.
- Since event4 does happen (given) and C1 holds, C2 (""event4 happens and C1 holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---

---
You are asking whether C2 (""Event4 happens and Event2 does not happen"") is guaranteed (true) given the context.

Step 1 — identify what is claimed:
- C2 = (event4 happens) AND (event2 does not happen).
- From context we know event4 does happen initially, so the only questionable part is whether event2 must not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- event4 happens initially.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen (at least one of them occurs after event4).
- After event1, event3 must happen (event1 forces a later event3).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 would also force a later event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- One allowed sequence: 4 → 3. Then event2 cannot occur after 3, so event2 does not happen in this run; C2 would hold.
- Another allowed sequence: 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This satisfies all rules: after 4 we had 1, after 1 eventually 3 (and after 2 also eventually 3), and after 3 nothing else. In this sequence event2 does happen, so C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false and thus C2 is false.

Since the context permits at least one valid sequence where event2 does occur, the claim that event2 does not happen is not entailed. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed to be true.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event4 happens or event2 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. (i.e. C1 → event2)

Step 2 — translate the context rules
- Initially event3 occurs.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace allowed sequences
- Since event3 initially happened and after event3 event4 must happen, event4 will occur.
- Once event4 occurs, no further events can happen. So the only events that actually occur are event3 then event4.
- In particular, event2 does not occur in any allowed continuation.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event4 or event2"") is true because event4 happens.
- C2 asserts that if C1 holds then event2 happens. Here C1 holds (via event4) but event2 does not happen — so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — relevant conditions
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules about event1/event2 relate to after event2 or after event1, but they do not force event2 to occur here.)

Step 3 — trace the actual sequence forced by the context
From ""initially event3"" and ""after event3, event4 must happen"" we get event3 then event4, and then nothing else (because after event4 no other events can happen). So event4 indeed happens and event2 does not occur in this sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""event4 happens or event2 happens"" — true in this context because event4 happens.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — this requires that whenever C1 is true, event2 must occur. But we have a model where C1 is true (because event4 happens) and event2 does not happen. That is a counterexample, so C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C1 is ""event4 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2 says: if C1 holds then event2 happens. Logically this is equivalent to ""if event4 happens then event2 happens"" (since if event2 already holds the implication is trivial).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace a sequence:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.

So a valid sequence is: event3 → event4, and then stop. In that sequence event4 happens (so C1 is true) but event2 does not happen.

Conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid sequence where C1 is true but event2 is false, C2 is false.

- The other rules (after event2, after event3, after event4) are irrelevant if no event occurs after event1.

- Because event1 occurs initially and no events can follow, event2 can never happen. So C1 is false in every possible execution.

Step 3 — examine C2 (the implication):

- Other rules (after event2 → event1 or event3; after event3 → event1 or event4; after event4 → event2 or event3) are irrelevant once event1 occurs because no events can occur after event1.

Step 3 — Reason about possible sequences:
- Since event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 can never occur. So C1 is false in all models of the context.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" makes the execution terminal once event2 occurs.
- Therefore in every reachable state/event sequence the fact ""event2 has happened"" holds.
- C1 (""event3 happens or event2 happens"") is satisfied because event2 has happened.
- Hence C1 holds in all possible (reachable) situations, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:

1. Hypothesis C1 is the statement ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., in every allowed sequence of events).

2. The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in every allowed sequence/event history, event2 has already occurred at the start.

3. The context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes the initial event2 terminal: there are no further events in any continuation.

4. Since event2 did happen (in every allowed history), the disjunction in C1 (""event3 happens or event2 happens"") is satisfied in every allowed history.

5. Therefore C1 holds in all possible histories, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every reachable situation (along every possible execution) C1 is true.

Step 2 — restate the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So event2 is terminal.)
- Other rules (what must follow event4, event3, event1) only matter if those events can occur, but none can occur after event2.

Step 3 — trace the possible executions:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, the only possible execution is the single event2 (and then stop). No execution exists in which event2 did not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- In every reachable execution/state, event2 has happened, so ""event3 or event2"" is true.
- Therefore C1 holds in all executions, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Hypothesis identification
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ""Event2 does not eventually happen.""

2. Examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" This means once event3 has occurred, no further events can occur thereafter.
- The other rules (about event4 forcing event1 or event3, and event2 forcing event3) only matter if those events could occur, but they cannot override the rule that nothing occurs after event3.

3. Trace possible sequences
- Since event3 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" prevents any further events ever occurring. In particular, Event2 cannot occur at any later time.

4. Conclusion
- Event2 does not eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.
---
C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens.""  
C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not eventually happen).

Given: initially event3 happens, and after event3 no other events can happen. Therefore no further events (including event2) can occur. So C1 is false and C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not eventually happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- Other rules (after event4 → event1 or event3; after event1 → no other events; after event2 → event3) are irrelevant if no events can occur after the initial event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- The sequence starts with event3 and must stop (no further events possible). Thus event2 cannot occur at any later time, and there is no prior time before the initial event3 for event2 to have happened.

Conclusion:
- Event2 does not eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis: C2 says ""If C1 (Event4 always happens) holds, then event3 happens.""
- From the context: initially event1. After 1 you must go to either 2 or 4. After 4 you must go to 1. After 3 nothing can follow (terminal). After 2 you may go to 1, 3, or 4.
- Consider the run that always chooses 4 after 1: 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... This run obeys all rules, contains event4, and never reaches event3.
- That shows a model where C1 holds (event4 does occur) but event3 does not happen; therefore C1 does not entail event3.

So C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C2 says: if C1 holds (i.e. event4 always happens), then event3 happens.
- From the rules: start at event1; from 1 the next must be 2 or 4; from 4 the next must be 1; from 3 no further events can occur.
- Consider the allowed infinite trace 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... . This satisfies all rules, has event4 happening (indeed repeatedly), and never includes event3.
- Thus there is a model where C1 is true but event3 does not happen, so the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis asks: assuming C1 (""Event4 always happens"") holds, does that force event3 to happen?
- From the rules: initially event1 occurs. After event1 we must do either event2 or event4. After event4 we must do event1. After event3 nothing else can happen. After event2 we may do event1, event3, or event4.
- Construct a run consistent with the rules and with C1 but without event3: 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... (always choose event4 after each event1). This run satisfies the rules, contains event4 (so C1 holds), and never contains event3.
- Therefore C1 does not imply event3; C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some point in the future it becomes true that Event1 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the constraints
- Initially event3 has occurred.
- After event3, event4 must happen → so event4 will occur.
- After event4, event1 must happen → so event1 will occur after event4.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal.
- (The rule about event2 is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs in the forced sequence.)

Step 3 — trace the forced sequence
- From the initial event3 we get event4, then event1, then nothing else.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true: event1 does eventually happen in this trace.
- C2 asks whether ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds from the initial state (event1 is guaranteed later), so ""eventually C1"" is true as well (there exists a time — in fact the current time — at which C1 is true).

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step:

- Initially event3 occurred.
- By ""After event3, event4 must happen"", event4 will occur at some later time.
- By ""After event4, event1 must happen"", event1 will occur after that.
- By ""After event1, no other events can happen"", event1 is terminal, but that doesn't prevent it from happening.

Therefore event1 will inevitably happen (C1 is true).

C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" is true. Since C1 is already true from the start (event1 will happen in the future), C2 is also true (and in general eventually(eventually P) is equivalent to eventually P).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point it will be true that event1 eventually happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen → so event4 will occur.
- After event4, event1 must happen → so event1 will occur after event4.
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal), but that does not prevent event1 itself.
- The rule after event2 is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event3 we get event4, and then event1. Therefore event1 is inevitable; C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 is already true (event1 will eventually happen), so there certainly exists a future point at which C1 holds. Therefore ""eventually C1"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — hypothesis:  
C1 = (Event2 or Event1).  
C2 = (C1) or (Event4). Question: is C2 true?

Step 2 — given conditions (starting point): initially Event4 happened. After Event4, either Event2 or Event3 must happen. After Event3, Event2 must happen. After Event2, either Event1 or Event4 must happen. After Event1, Event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reasoning:  
- Directly: Event4 did happen initially, so ""Event4 happens"" is true; therefore C2 = C1 or Event4 is true immediately.  
- Alternatively (independent check): from Event4 we get Event2 or Event3; if Event3 then it forces Event2, so in all branches Event2 will occur, so C1 (Event2 or Event1) would also be true. Thus C2 holds either way.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or Event4 happens.""  
We must decide whether C2 is true given the initial facts and transition rules.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions / transitions
- Initially Event4 happened.
- After Event4: either Event2 or Event3 must happen.
- After Event3: Event2 must happen.
- After Event2: either Event1 or Event4 must happen.
- After Event1: Event2 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace possibilities
- If after the initial Event4 we get Event2, then Event2 has occurred, so C1 is true (Event2 happens). Hence C2 (C1 or Event4) is true.
- If after the initial Event4 we get Event3, then by the rules Event2 must follow Event3, so Event2 still occurs, so C1 is true, hence C2 is true.
- Also, independently, Event4 already happened initially, so the second disjunct of C2 (Event4 happens) is already true.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- In every allowed sequence, C1 holds (Event2 necessarily occurs), and Event4 also already occurred. Therefore C2 is guaranteed true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace events
- Initially event4 happened (given).
- From event4, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
  - If event4 → event2, then event2 happens.
  - If event4 → event3, then by the rule after event3, event2 must happen; so event2 happens anyway.
- Therefore event2 inevitably happens after the initial event4.
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — since event2 does happen, C1 is True.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event4 happens"" — C1 is True, and event4 also happened initially, so C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Answering the hypothesis:

- Identify hypothesis: C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" C2 states ""C1 always holds.""
- Examination: The provided event rules constrain possible sequences but do not affect the logical form of C1.
- Reasoning: C1 is a logical tautology (P → P). A tautology is true in every state/possible world, so it holds under all system behaviors.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (a conditional P → P with P = ""event3 happens"")
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide if C1 is always true given the event rules.

Step 2 — examine the form of C1
- C1 is a logical tautology: any statement of the form P → P is always true (whenever P is true, P is true).
- Its truth does not depend on the event-transition rules or on whether event3 ever actually occurs.

Step 3 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 is always true in every state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

Answer: True
---
First, identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (i.e. event3 → event3)
- C2: ""C1 always holds.""

Examine C1:
- In propositional logic, p → p is a tautology: it is true in every possible situation. If event3 occurs, the conclusion ""event3 happens"" is the same as the premise, so the implication is true; if event3 does not occur, the implication is true vacuously.

The given initial condition and transition rules don't affect this: C1's truth does not depend on the system's dynamics.

Therefore C1 indeed always holds, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened, so the atomic fact ""event4 happens"" is true.
- C1 asserts ""event4 happens in the next state."" After event4 the allowed next events are event1, event2, or event3, so event4 cannot occur in the next state. Thus C1 is False.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" The second disjunct (""event4 happens"") is true because event4 occurred initially, so the whole disjunction C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 asserts: event4 happens in the next state. From the rules, after event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}, so event4 cannot happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" The context states that event4 happened initially, so the disjunction is satisfied by the fact that event4 happens (in the initial state). Therefore C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning in brief:
- C1 = ""event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event4 happens.""
- The context states that initially event4 happened, so the disjunct ""event4 happens"" is already true.
- Therefore the disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the timeline C1 becomes true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event3 has happened initially and after event3 no other events can occur, event2 cannot occur now or at any future time.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is true from the start and remains true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 already holds initially, so it certainly holds at some point in the future (immediately). Thus C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 never occurs in the trace).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some point in the execution from which C1 is true — equivalently, at some time we have that event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace the execution
- Because event3 happened initially and after event3 no other events can happen, the execution stops immediately after event3.
- Therefore event2 does not occur at any point in the execution.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 is true in the execution (event2 never happens).
- Since C1 already holds (and hence holds at some time), C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point it is true that event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So the occurrence of event3 makes the future terminal: no event1, event2, or event4 can occur later.)
- Other rules (after event1/2/4) are irrelevant because event3 already occurred initially.

Step 3 — reason about event2:
- Because event3 happened initially and after event3 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any time (neither now nor later).
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

Step 4 — reason about C2:
- If C1 is already true (holds immediately), then it certainly ""eventually holds"" (there exists a time at which it holds).
- Thus C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1 = ""Event4 happens and event3 happens"" (i.e., event4 ∧ event3).
- C2 = ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" (i.e., (event4 ∧ event3) → event4).

Step 2 — evaluate the implication
- An implication (A ∧ B) → A is a logical tautology: if A ∧ B is true then A must be true. So C2 is true by logic.
- (Even if C1 were impossible under the event rules, the implication would be vacuously true when C1 is false.)

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning: C1 asserts ""Event4 happens and event3 happens."" That already includes ""Event4 happens."" So the implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is logically true (a conjunction implies each conjunct), independent of the given event-sequence constraints.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens.""
- C1 states: ""Event4 happens and event3 happens.""

Step 2 — logical analysis:
- C1 is the conjunction (event4 ∧ event3).
- From a conjunction, each conjunct follows (conjunction elimination). Therefore, if C1 holds, event4 must hold.

Step 3 — note on context:
- The given event-sequence constraints do not affect this elementary logical implication; C1 already includes event4.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step by step):
- The hypothesis asks whether ""event4 happens or event1 happens"" will hold at some time (C1 eventually holds).
- From the premises, event1 happened initially (at time 0).
- Therefore C1 (event4 or event1) is already true at the initial time (because event1 happened).
- If a formula holds now, it certainly holds ""eventually"" (the eventuality can be satisfied immediately).
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1 is ""event4 happens or event1 happens."" C2 is ""C1 eventually holds.""
- Initially event1 happened, so C1 already holds at the start. Therefore C1 holds now, hence it eventually holds — C2 is true.
- (Stronger view) From the rules: after event1 either event2 or event4 must happen. If event4 happens, C1 holds; if event2 happens then event3 must follow and then event4 must follow, so event4 will still occur. Thus in all possible continuations event4 occurs, so C1 will eventually be true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event4 happens or Event1 happens.""
- Initially Event1 happened, so C1 already holds at the initial moment.
- Even if ""eventually"" required a (strict) future moment, the rules force Event4 eventually: after Event1 either Event2 or Event4 occurs; if Event4 occurs immediately we are done; if Event2 occurs then Event3 must follow and after Event3 Event4 must follow. So in all cases Event4 will occur at some future point.
- Therefore C1 holds (now or at some future point), so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; since ""event1 happens"" is true, C2 is true regardless of C1.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (a global claim that event3 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (i.e. (not event3) OR event1).

Step 2 — examine the facts:
- Initially, event1 happened. So the proposition ""event1 happens"" is true (at least at the start).
- The transition rules allow many possible futures (e.g. 1 → 2 → 3, or 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ...), so C1 (that event3 never happens) is not guaranteed: there are paths where event3 does occur and paths where it does not.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the disjunction (C1) OR (event1 happens). Since ""event1 happens"" is true (it occurred initially), the whole disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

We are asked whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true, given the transition rules and C1 (""Event1 always happens"").

Interpretation and key rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2}.
(Other rules exist but the 1→{2,3,4} and 3→{1,2} transitions are the ones we need.)

Counterexample showing C2 is false:
- Start at the initial event1.
- After that event1, choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3, choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat: 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, ...
This infinite sequence is consistent with all given rules, contains event1 repeatedly (so C1 can be taken to hold in the natural sense that event1 keeps occurring), and never contains event2.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed: C1 can hold while event2 never happens. Final answer: False.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context gives transition rules: after event1 the next event must be 2, 3, or 4 (so event1 cannot follow event1).
- Therefore there is no possible execution in which event1 occurs at every step — C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is impossible/unsatisfiable under the given rules.
- An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true: in every model where C1 holds (there are none), the consequent holds vacuously.
- Hence C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is True."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis: C2 says ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" So C2 is the statement: if event1 occurs, then event2 does not occur.

Now the context rules:

- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen (given repeatedly).
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event2, one of event1/event3/event4 must happen.
- After event3, one of event1/event2/event4 must happen.

Because event4 already happened initially and no events can occur after event4, there can be no further events at all. In particular, event1 can never happen in any allowed sequence, and event2 also never happens.

An implication ""if event1 happens then event2 does not happen"" is true whenever the antecedent (event1 happens) cannot occur. Also, in fact event2 does not occur either. Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
C2 says: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" So C2 asserts: whenever event1 occurs, event2 does not occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen. (This is stated repeatedly; it makes event4 terminal.)
- Therefore, once event4 has happened initially, no event1, event2, or event3 can happen afterward.

Step 3 — trace allowed sequences
Given the initial event4 and that no events can follow it, the only possible sequence is just event4. In particular, event1 cannot happen in any allowed sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate the implication
An implication ""If event1 happens, then event2 does not happen"" is vacuously true if event1 never happens. Also, event2 does not happen in the actual sequence. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event2 does not happen).
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen (repeatedly stated).
Thus the only event that occurs is the initial event4; no event1 or event2 (or event3) can occur afterwards.

Step 3 — Reason about C1 and C2
- Since no events after event4 are possible, event2 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2 is the implication ""if event1 happens then C1."" Because C1 is true regardless, the implication is true (an implication with a true consequent is true, and in fact event1 cannot happen anyway, making the implication vacuously true as well).

Conclusion
C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning, step-by-step:
1. Initially event1 happened.
2. The rules state: ""After event1, event4 must happen."" That forces event4 to happen.
3. C1 is ""Event2 happens or event4 happens."" Since event4 happens, C1 is true.
4. C2 is the negation of C1 (""C1 does not hold""). Because C1 is true, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens or Event4 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., neither Event2 nor Event4 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace events:
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- After Event1, Event4 must happen. Therefore Event4 does happen (given the ""must"" requirement).
- Since Event4 happens, C1 (""Event2 or Event4 happens"") is true.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- C1 is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify C2:
- C1 is ""event2 or event4 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""neither event2 nor event4 happens"" (¬event2 ∧ ¬event4).

Step 2 — apply the context rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Since event4 must happen, the claim ""¬event4"" (part of C2) is false, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at every step/event, event1 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of C1)

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transition rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event4.
- After event3 → event4.
- After event4 → either event2 or event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences to test C1
- From the initial event1 we can choose event3 next (allowed). So one possible continuation is:
  1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 → ...
  In that run, after the initial event1 there are many steps where event1 does not occur at all.
- Because after event1 the next event can be 3 (which leads to 4, then to 2 or 3, etc.), there exist traces where event1 does not occur at every step. Thus ""Event1 always happens"" is false.

Conclusion
- C1 does not hold, so C2 is True. Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when C1 is false.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event4.
- After event3 → event4 (must).
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 (repeated statements are the same constraint).

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence that violates C1
- Start: 1 (given).
- After 1 choose 3 (allowed).
- After 3 must be 4.
- After 4 choose 3.
- After 3 must be 4, and so on.

This yields the infinite valid sequence: 1, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, ...
Event1 occurs initially but not thereafter, so ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false.

Conclusion
- C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 does not always happen).

We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happens.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event4.
- After event3 → event4 (must).
- After event4 → either event2 or event3.

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence showing C1 can fail
Start with the required initial event1, then choose transitions that avoid returning to event1:
1 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ...
Each step follows the rules:
- After the initial 1 we chose 3 (allowed).
- After 3 we must go to 4 (given).
- After 4 we chose 3 (allowed).
This produces an infinite trace where event1 occurs only initially and never again. That shows ""Event1 always happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid behavior consistent with the constraints in which Event1 does not always occur, C1 does not hold. Therefore C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the current/initial state, event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen. So the next state after the initial one has event4.
- That next state therefore has event4 (not event2). Later choices (after event4) allow event2 or event3, but that concerns subsequent states, not the immediate next state.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- In the next state (the one with event4), event2 does not happen, so C1 is true in that next state. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happened (call that state s0).
- The rule ""after event3, event4 must happen"" forces the next state s1 to be event4.
- C1 says ""event2 does not happen"" (i.e., in a given state, event2 is not the event that occurs).
- In s1 the event that occurs is event4, so event2 does not happen in s1 — C1 holds in s1.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in s1). Since C1 is true in s1, C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 occurred.

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened, so the next event must be event1 (rule: after event3, event1 must happen).
- From event1 the next event may be event2, event3, or event4.
- It is allowed to choose event3 again from event1, which yields the repeating sequence 3,1,3,1,... and never produces event4.
- Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules that never includes event4, event4 is not guaranteed to happen.

Therefore C1 (""Event4 always happens"") does not hold, so C2 is True.

True
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False. C1 states ""Event4 always happens.""

Examine the rules:
- Initially event3.
- 3 → 1 (after event3, event1 must happen).
- 1 → {2,3,4}.
- 2 → {1,3,4}.
- 4 → 3.

From the initial event3 we get event1 next. From event1 we may choose event3. Then from event3 we must go back to event1. So the infinite sequence 3,1,3,1,3,1,... is allowed by the rules and never contains event4. Therefore event4 does not always happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event4 always happens."" So C2 is true exactly when there is some valid execution in which event4 does not always happen (i.e., event4 is not inevitable / not present in every run).

Examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2, the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event4, event3 must happen.

Construct a valid execution that avoids event4:
- Start: 3 (given) → then 1 (forced).
- From 1 choose 3 (allowed).
- From 3 → 1 (forced).
- Repeat: ... → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ...

This infinite alternation (3,1,3,1,...) respects all constraints and never includes event4. Therefore event4 is not guaranteed to always happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C2 is the statement ""Event3 happens OR C1 holds"". We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. So ""Event3 happens"" is true (it occurred).
- Other rules (after event3 → event4, after event4 → event3, after event1 nothing else, after event2 → event3) don't negate the fact that event3 did happen; they only constrain what can follow.

Step 3 — conclude
Since Event3 happens is true, the disjunction ""Event3 happens OR C1 holds"" is true regardless of C1.

Final answer: True
---
What C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" (and C1 is ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"").

Step-by-step:
- The context states that initially event3 happened. So ""Event3 happens"" is true (at least at the initial moment).
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since ""Event3 happens"" is true, the whole disjunction ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" is true, regardless of C1.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (Event2 happens) OR (Event1 happens).
- C2 = (Event3 happens) OR C1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event3 happened."" So Event3 does happen (at least initially).
- Other rules (after event3 → event4, after event4 → event3, after event2 → event3, after event1 → no further events) do not negate that initial occurrence of Event3.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- C2 is true if Event3 happens OR if C1 holds.
- Since Event3 already happened initially, the disjunct ""Event3 happens"" is satisfied, so C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e. at a given step the current event is not event1).
- C2 is ""Eventually C1 holds"" (there exists some future step where the current event is not event1).
- From the initial condition: event3 happens.
- The rules force: after event3, event1 must happen. So the next step is event1 (so C1 is false at that next step).
- But after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. In either case the immediate following step is not event1, so at that next step C1 is true.
- Therefore there is a future step where ""Event1 does not happen"" holds, so C2 is true.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpret the rules as immediate successor constraints (whenever an event X happens, the next event must be one of the specified ones).
- From the given conditions we have the transition graph:
  - 3 -> 1
  - 1 -> 2 or 4
  - 2 -> 3
  - 4 -> 2 or 3
- Start: initial event is 3. So the next event must be 1 (3 -> 1), so Event1 does happen.
- From 1 you go to 2 or 4. Either choice eventually leads back to 3 (1->2->3 or 1->4->(2 or 3)->3), and from 3 you must go to 1 again.
- Thus any continuation cycles through 1 repeatedly; Event1 occurs infinitely often and cannot be permanently avoided.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false, and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., the current event is not event2).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some future point at which C1 is true (some future step where the event is not event2).

Step 2 — examine the constraints and the initial condition
- Initially event2 happened.
- From event2 the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4} (event2 is not allowed immediately after event2).
- From event1 → event3, from event3 → event1 (so 1 and 3 alternate thereafter).
- From event4 → one of {1,2,3}.

Step 3 — trace possible immediate futures
- Whatever choice is made immediately after the initial event2, the next event cannot be event2 (by the rule for after event2). So at the very next step the event is 1, 3, or 4 — in all cases ""Event2 does not happen"" at that step, so C1 holds then.
- (Even if event4 is chosen and later leads back to event2, C1 still held at that intermediate step; C2 only requires existence of some future point where C1 is true.)

Conclusion
- There is always a future step (indeed the immediate next step) where event2 does not happen, so C2 is True.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. eventually we reach a point after which Event2 never happens.

Examine the rules and trace possibilities:
- Initially Event2 happens.
- After Event2, the next event must be one of {Event1, Event3, Event4}.
- After Event4, the next event must be one of {Event1, Event2, Event3}.
- After Event1 → Event3, and after Event3 → Event1 (so 1 and 3 force each other, producing a 1–3 loop).
- Thus there are two relevant behaviors after the initial Event2:
  - Choose Event1 after the initial Event2 → then 1→3→1→3…; Event2 never happens again, so C1 eventually holds in that run.
  - Choose Event4 after the initial Event2 → then choose Event2 after Event4 → back to Event2, and repeat: 2,4,2,4,2,... This infinite run satisfies all constraints and Event2 keeps occurring indefinitely, so there is no point after which Event2 never happens (C1 never becomes permanently true).

Since there exists a valid run that prevents C1 from ever holding permanently, C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") is not guaranteed. Therefore the claim C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event3 does not always happen)
We are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and initial state:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen. So from the start, event3 is forced to occur.
- After event3, the next event is either event1 or event2.
  - If event1 happens, no further events occur (but event3 already occurred).
  - If event2 happens, the next event is either event1 or event4.
    - If that next is event4, then event3 must happen again (because after event4, event3 must happen).
    - If that next is event1, the trace ends (but event3 already occurred earlier).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Starting: event4 → event3 → event1 (ends). Event3 occurred.
- Or: event4 → event3 → event2 → event1 (ends). Event3 occurred.
- Or: event4 → event3 → event2 → event4 → event3 → … (event3 occurs repeatedly along this cycle).
In every possible execution from the given initial state, event3 occurs (at least once). Therefore ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is true.

Conclusion:
- C1 is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 occurred.
- The rule ""After event4, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur next.
- Thus every possible sequence starting from the initial condition contains event3 (at least that one forced occurrence).
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is true, so its negation C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not always happen).

We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and initial state:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen (4 → 3).
- After event3, the next event is either 1 or 2 (3 → {1,2}).
- After event1 nothing else can happen (1 is terminal).
- After event2 the next event is either 1 or 4 (2 → {1,4}), and if 4 happens again it forces 3 again.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Starting from the initial event4, the next event must be 3. So every possible sequence beginning from the given initial condition contains event3 (at least that first time).
- Subsequent branching (3→1 stops; 3→2 may lead to 1 or 4, and 4→3 forces 3 again) only adds more occurrences of 3 or terminates after an already-occurred 3. No path avoids the initial 3.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is true under the given rules and initial condition.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether C2 (""Event3 happens or Event4 does not happen"") must be true given the constraints.

1. Start: event2 happened.
2. After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen. Choose event4.
3. After event4, event1 must happen. So event1 follows.
4. After event1, one of {event2, event4} must happen. Choose event4.
5. Repeat steps 3–4 to get an infinite loop: ... event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 ... . This sequence satisfies all given constraints and contains event4 but never contains event3.

Because there is a valid sequence where event4 happens and event3 never happens, the statement ""event3 happens or event4 does not happen"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the rules. C1 is ""Event4 does not happen"", so C2 is equivalent to (event3 ∨ ¬event4).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initial condition: event2 happened.
- From event2, at least one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen next.
- Pick the branch event1 (allowed). From event1, at least one of {event2, event4} must happen next.
- Pick event4 (allowed). From event4, event1 must happen next, and from that event1 we can choose event4 again, etc.
- This produces a valid sequence: event2 → event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ... in which event4 does happen and event3 never happens.

Because there is a valid execution where event4 occurs and event3 does not, C1 is false and event3 is false in that execution, so C2 is false (it is not entailed by the rules).

Final answer:
False
---
Identify hypothesis: C2 = ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event4 does not happen"". So C2 is true iff either event3 occurs at some point or event4 never occurs.

Examine rules and build a counterexample:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, one allowed next event is event4 (rule: after event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen).
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, one allowed next event is event4 (rule: after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen).

Construct a valid infinite sequence: 2 → 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... .
- This respects all rules: after 2 pick 4, after 4 pick 1, after 1 pick 4, etc.
- In this sequence event4 does happen (so C1 is false) and event3 never happens.

Thus there is a model of the rules in which neither event3 happens nor C1 holds, so C2 is not guaranteed. Final answer: False"

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted as: whenever event3 occurs, event2 will occur (at some point).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some future time onward, C1 is true.

From the constraints: initially event4. After event4, event3 is allowed, and after event3, event4 is allowed. So the infinite trace
4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, ...
is valid under the given rules. In that trace event3 occurs repeatedly but event2 never occurs. Thus C1 is false in that trace (event3 occurs without event2), and there is no future point after which C1 becomes true. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" asks whether at some point onward C1 is true (i.e., from that point all occurrences of event3 are followed by event2).
- Start with the initial event4 (given). From the rules: 4 -> {1,2,3}, 3 -> {1,4}, 1 -> {2,3,4}, 2 -> 3.
- Construct a legal infinite trace that violates C1 and prevents C1 from ever becoming permanently true: choose 4, then 3, then 1, then 3, then 1, ... i.e. the infinite sequence 4,3,1,3,1,3,1,...
  - Each transition obeys the rules: 4→3 allowed, 3→1 allowed, 1→3 allowed, etc.
  - Event3 occurs infinitely often in this trace, but event2 never occurs.
- Because there is a valid execution where 3 happens yet 2 never happens, C1 is not true in that execution. And because the execution can continue forever with no 2, C1 never becomes permanently true; so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""
- From the rules we have transitions 3 -> {1,4}, 1 -> {2,3,4}, and 4 -> {1,2,3}.
- Starting from the initial event4, the sequence 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... is allowed (choose 4->3, 3->1, 1->4, and repeat). This trace contains event3 infinitely often but never contains event2.
- Therefore C1 is false along this valid trace, and so there is no time after which C1 becomes true forever. Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has happened (as it did initially), no events can occur in any subsequent state.
- C1 asserts ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That would be a subsequent state after the initial event1, but by the rule no events can happen after event1, so C1 is false.
- Because no events can happen after the initial event1, event3 cannot happen either, so ""event3 happens"" is false.
- C2 is ""event3 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the facts. Step-by-step:

1. The scenario starts with ""Initially, event1 happened.""
2. One rule says ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred (the initial state), there can be no subsequent event in the next state.
3. C1 asserts ""Event1 happens in the next state."" But by (2) no events at all can happen after the initial event1, so C1 is false.
4. C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true only if event3 happens in the next state. But (2) forbids any event (including event3) after the initial event1, so event3 cannot happen in the next state.
5. Therefore neither disjunct holds, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur after the initial event1).
- After event4, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event4 does not occur).
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason through sequences
- Since initially event1 happened and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" there is no next event at all.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false (no event occurs in the next state).
- Because no events can occur after the initial event1, Event3 cannot happen either.
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (concise): The facts state that initially event2 happened, and after event2 event4 must happen. Therefore event4 does happen. Since C2 is the disjunction ""event4 happens or C1 holds,"" it is true because its left disjunct (event4 happens) is true.
---

---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C2 = ""Event4 happens OR (if event1 happens then event4 happens).""

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event4 must happen. Therefore event4 does happen (in every valid sequence).

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since event4 happens, the disjunction in C2 is true regardless of the conditional.

Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" The question: is C2 true given the conditions?

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen. (So any run with event1 will have event4 later.)
- Other rules (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event2 → event1; after event4 → event1 or event2) don't prevent the above.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- Since event1 happened initially, by the rule ""after event1, event4 must happen,"" event4 will indeed occur at some point. Therefore C1 is true.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2
- C2 is ""event2 happens or C1 holds."" Because C1 holds, C2 is true (regardless of whether event2 ever occurs).

Final answer:
True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur at some point after that initial event1.
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 eventually happens"") is true in every valid sequence.
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 holds, C2 is true (regardless of whether event2 ever happens).
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 asserts ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event4 eventually happens."" We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the given conditions.

Examine the conditions and trace consequences:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From ""After event1, event4 must happen"" we deduce that event4 will eventually occur. Thus C1 (event4 eventually happens) is true.
- Once C1 is true, the disjunction in C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is satisfied regardless of whether event2 ever occurs.

Therefore C2 is necessarily true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., event1 eventually happens (same eventuality).

Step 2 — transitions (from the context):
- 2 -> {1, 3, 4}
- 1 -> {2, 4}
- 3 -> 4
- 4 -> 1

Step 3 — trace all possible continuations from the initial event2:
- If 2 -> 1, event1 occurs immediately.
- If 2 -> 4, then 4 -> 1, so event1 occurs next.
- If 2 -> 3, then 3 -> 4 -> 1, so event1 occurs within two steps.

In every possible branch starting from event2, event1 must occur. Therefore C1 holds, and so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = F(C1) = F(F event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and possible traces starting from the initial event2:
- From event2 the next event must be one of: event1, event3, or event4.
  - If event1 happens next, C1 is satisfied immediately.
  - If event3 happens next, then event4 must follow, and after event4 event1 must follow, so event1 still occurs (in two steps).
  - If event4 happens next, event1 must follow, so event1 occurs (in one step).

Thus in every possible continuation from the initial state, event1 occurs within at most two steps. Therefore C1 (F event1) is true at the initial state.

Step 3 — relationship between C1 and C2:
- Since C1 is already true, C2 = F(C1) is also true (and in temporal logic F(F p) ≡ F p).

Final answer:
True
---
First, clarify the statements:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., on every run from the initial state, some future step is event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future time point it becomes true that event1 will eventually happen).

From the context:

- Start at event2.
- From 2 the next event must be one of {1,3,4}.
- From 3 the next must be 4, and from 4 the next must be 1.
- From 2 → 1 is also allowed.

So every possible continuation starting at 2 reaches event1 within at most two steps:
- 2 → 1 (immediate),
- 2 → 4 → 1,
- 2 → 3 → 4 → 1.

Thus C1 is true (event1 is guaranteed to occur). Since C1 holds already from the initial state, there certainly exists a time (the start) at which C1 holds, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also true.

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point, either event2 or event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Transitions: 2 → 4, 4 → 1, 1 → {2,3,4}, 3 → {2,4}. (The repeated ""4 → 1"" is redundant.)

Step 3 — trace and conclude
- Because event2 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at time 0.
- Therefore C1 does eventually hold (immediately), so C2 is true. (Indeed the transition rules also produce cycles 2→4→1→... so 1 or 2 will continue to occur.)

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some point either event2 or event1 occurs).
- The context states that initially event2 happened. That means C1 is already true at the initial time.
- Therefore C1 does eventually hold (immediately), so C2 is true.

(As a note: the transition rules also create a cycle 2 → 4 → 1 → … so event1 and event2 will continue to occur in the future as well.)
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in time, event2 or event1 will occur).

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at time 0 event2 is true).
- Transition rules: after event2 → event4; after event4 → event1; after event1 → one of event2/event3/event4; after event3 → event2 or event4. (These rules actually produce a cycle that repeatedly yields event1 and event2.)

Step 3 — reason about C2
- Since event2 has already happened initially, C1 (""event2 or event1"") is already true at the initial time.
- Therefore C1 holds at some time (now), so ""eventually C1 holds"" is satisfied.
- (Additionally, the transition rules produce cycles like event2 → event4 → event1 → event2 …, ensuring C1 will continue to hold repeatedly.)

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The rules allow these transitions: 4 -> {1,2,3}, 1 -> {3,4}, 2 -> {1,3}, 3 -> {4}. Initial event4 occurs.
- To refute ""If event1 happens then event3 does not happen"" it suffices to give a possible trace where event1 happens and event3 also happens.
- Counterexample trace: start with initial event4, then choose event1 (allowed by 4 -> {1,2,3}), then from event1 choose event3 (allowed by 1 -> {3,4}). This trace has event1 and also event3, so C1 (event3 does not happen) is false despite event1 happening.
- Therefore C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen (i.e., globally no event3).
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, event3 does not occur anywhere).

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event4.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event1, one of {event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3} must happen.

Step 3 — trace a counterexample:
- Start: event4 (given).
- After event4 choose event1 (allowed).
- After event1 choose event3 (allowed).
This yields the sequence 4 → 1 → 3, which is consistent with all rules and contains both event1 and event3.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid sequence where event1 happens and event3 also happens, the implication ""If event1 happens, then event3 does not happen"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2 says: ""If event1 happens, then event3 does not happen"" (i.e., event1 → C1).

From the rules:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event1 is an allowed next event.
- After event1, event3 is an allowed next event.

So there is a valid sequence: event4 → event1 → event3. In that sequence event1 happens and event3 also happens, so C1 is false while the antecedent of C2 is true. Therefore the implication in C2 is falsified. Thus C2 is False."

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event3 does not happen."" So C2 asserts that whenever event2 occurs, event3 never occurs.
- Given rules (transitions):
  - Start: event2 happened.
  - After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
  - After event1: either event3 or event4 must happen.
  - After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - After event4: event2 must happen.
- A permitted sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 (choose after 2) → event3 (choose after 1). This sequence obeys all rules and includes both event2 and event3.
- Because there exists a valid trace where event2 happens and event3 also happens, the implication ""if event2 happens then event3 does not happen"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:

- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event2 happens then event3 does not happen).

- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 → either event1 or event4.
- After event1 → either event3 or event4.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2.
- After event4 → event2.

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2:
- Start: event2 (given).
- After event2 choose event1.
- After event1 choose event3.
This yields a valid sequence (event2 → event1 → event3) consistent with all rules, in which event3 does happen.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 occurred, and the rules say: ""After event3, no other events can happen."" That means once event3 has happened, there are no further events in any following state.
- C1 asserts event3 happens (twice redundantly), which is true in the initial state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. But since no events can happen after event3, event3 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false there.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — effectively says event3 holds (conjoined with itself) in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asks whether event3 holds in the immediate next state.

Step 2 — relevant conditions from the context
- Initially, event3 happened (so C1 is true in the initial state).
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" This means once event3 occurs, there are no subsequent events (so event3 cannot occur again in a following state).

Step 3 — trace/reasoning
- Since event3 has occurred initially and no events can occur after event3, there is no next state in which event3 occurs.
- Therefore C1 (which requires event3) does not hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 requires ""event3 happens"" (redundantly stated twice).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. event3 happens in the next state.
- The context says ""Initially, event3 happened"" and ""After event3, no other events can happen."" That makes event3 terminal: once it happens, there are no subsequent events (including another occurrence of event3).
- Therefore in the next state no event3 can happen, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state).

Step 2 — apply the given conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen. Therefore in the next state (immediately after the initial state) event3 occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state:
- Because event3 occurs in the next state, C1 (""event3 or event2"") is true in that next state.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
We are asked whether C2 is true: C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", where C1 is ""event3 happens or event2 happens"".

Given the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen.

""After event4, event3 must happen"" forces the next state (immediately after the initial state) to contain event3. Therefore in that next state event3 is true, so C1 (event3 or event2) is true in the next state.

Thus C2 is True. 

True
---
True

Reasoning:
1. Initially event4 happened.
2. The rule ""After event4, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur in the next state after the initial one.
3. C1 is ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Since event3 does happen in that next state, C1 is satisfied there.
4. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state — which it does.

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We interpret C1 as the proposition ""event2 does not happen (anymore)"" and C2 as ""eventually C1 holds"" — i.e., there is a future point after which event2 never occurs.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens.
- By the rules, after that event3 must happen, and then event4 must happen.
- After event4 the system nondeterministically must do either event1 or event3.
  - If it repeatedly chooses event3 after event4, the system can loop 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 … forever. In that run, after the initial event2 the system never does event2 again, so C1 holds from some point on and C2 is satisfied in that run.
  - But if at some occurrences of event4 the system chooses event1, then after event1 it may choose event2 (since after event1 one of {event2,event3,event4} must happen). Choosing event2 yields a cycle 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 …, so event2 can occur infinitely often in that run. In such runs C1 never becomes permanently true, so C2 fails.
- Because there exist executions where C2 holds and others where it does not, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer: False
---
Plan:
- Identify C1 and C2.
- List the transition rules.
- Find whether C2 (that C1 eventually holds) must be true in all allowed sequences.
- Give a counterexample run if it can fail.

1) Hypotheses
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., from some point onward no event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually there is a time after which event2 never occurs).

2) Transition rules (given)
- Initially: event2 occurs.
- After event2 → event3 (must).
- After event3 → event4 (must).
- After event4 → event1 or event3.
- After event1 → event2 or event3 or event4.

3) Reasoning / traces
- One possible infinite trace (choosing event1 after every event4, and event2 after every event1) is:
  event2 → event3 → event4 → event1 → event2 → event3 → event4 → event1 → event2 → ... 
  This respects all rules and produces event2 infinitely often, so there is no time after which event2 never occurs. On this trace C1 never holds, so C2 fails on this trace.

- There are also traces where C2 would hold (e.g., always choose event3 after event4: event2 → event3 → event4 → event3 → event4 → ... and then no further event2). So C2 is possible on some runs but not guaranteed.

4) Conclusion
C2 is not guaranteed (not true in all allowed executions) because the cyclic trace above is a valid counterexample.

False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says: Event2 or Event3 happens. C2 is the negation: neither Event2 nor Event3 happens.
- Start: Event4 happened. From Event4, either Event1 or Event3 must happen.
  - If Event3 happens, then Event3 occurred → C1 true.
  - If Event1 happens, then Event2 must happen after Event1 → Event2 occurred → C1 true.
- In every possible branch from the initial Event4, either Event2 or Event3 occurs, so C1 is necessarily true and C2 (its negation) is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.
  - If event1 happens, then after event1 event2 must happen → event2 occurs, so ""event2 or event3"" is true.
  - If event3 happens, then event3 has occurred → ""event2 or event3"" is true (regardless of what follows).
- In both possible immediate continuations, either event2 or event3 occurs. Therefore C1 is necessarily true, so its negation C2 is false.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""neither Event2 nor Event3 happens"") is true.

Start from the initial condition: Event4 happened. The rule after Event4 says either Event1 or Event3 must happen next.
- If Event3 happens then Event3 occurs (so C1 holds, C2 fails).
- If Event1 happens then, by the rule after Event1, Event2 must happen (so Event2 occurs; C1 holds, C2 fails).

In every possible branch from the initial Event4, either Event2 or Event3 occurs. Therefore C1 is true and C2 (its negation) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Initially event1 has happened, so C1 (""event1 or event4 happens"") is true at the start.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes event1 terminal: there are no further events or states after the initial event1.
- Because nothing can happen after that point, there is no possible future state where C1 could become false.
- Therefore C1 holds in the initial state and at all (reachable) times thereafter — C1 always holds. Hence C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in all reachable moments, either event1 or event4 has happened/is happening).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So the initial moment satisfies C1 (event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus event1 is terminal: there are no further transitions from the initial situation.
- Other rules (what must follow event2, event3, event4) only matter if those events can occur, but they cannot occur because the initial event1 prevents any further events.

Step 3 — Trace reachable sequences
- The only reachable trace is: event1 (and then nothing else).

Step 4 — Conclusion
- In every reachable moment (the initial/only moment) either event1 or event4 holds — in fact event1 holds. Therefore C1 holds always in the reachable system.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. in every possible execution/trace C1 is true.
- The initial condition states that event1 happened (at the start). So in every execution/event trace event1 has occurred.
- Therefore in every execution at least one of {event1, event4} has happened (specifically event1).
- Other rules (after event1 no other events can happen, after event4 event1 must happen, etc.) do not create any execution in which neither event1 nor event4 occurs.
Hence C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which simplifies to ""Event3 happens"".
- C2 is ""Eventually C1 holds"", i.e. ""Eventually Event3 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means Event3 has already occurred at the initial moment.
- The other transition rules (what must happen after event2/event4, and that nothing follows event1) do not prevent event3 from having already happened initially.

Step 3 — trace/decide:
- Since Event3 has already happened initially, C1 holds immediately, so C2 (""eventually Event3 happens"") is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" simplifies to ""Event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means ""Event3 happens at some point (now or later).""
- The context states that initially Event3 happened, so Event3 has already occurred.
- Therefore C1 holds immediately, so C2 (eventually C1) is true.
---
Step-by-step:

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event3 happens"".
2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Event3 eventually holds"".
3. The context says ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means Event3 already holds at the initial moment.
4. If Event3 holds initially, it certainly holds at some (the initial) time, so it holds eventually.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event4 -> event3).
- C2: (C1) or (event3).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- Initially event1 happens.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has happened (it happens initially), no further events can occur in any allowed sequence.
- The other rules (""After event2, no other events can happen""; ""After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen""; ""After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen"") are irrelevant if no events after event1 can occur.

Step 3 — consequences:
- Because event1 happens initially and forbids any subsequent events, event2, event3, and event4 cannot occur in any allowed sequence.
- C1 (event4 -> event3) is therefore vacuously true: event4 never occurs, so the implication holds.
- Since C1 holds, the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is true (even though event3 does not happen).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event4 happens, then event3 happens. (Implication: event4 → event3.)
- C2: C1 holds or event3 happens. (C1 ∨ event3.)
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred — and it already did initially — no further events can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant because event2 will not occur if no events can occur after event1.)
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and the context forbids any events after event1, no other events (including event2, event3, event4) can occur in any allowed scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event4 → event3): The antecedent ""event4 happens"" is impossible under the context, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C1 holds.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" Since C1 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of event3.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event4 happens, then event3 happens. (event4 → event3)
- C2: C1 holds or event3 happens. ( (event4 → event3) ∨ event3 )

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (so once event1 has happened, the sequence ends)
- Other rules (after event2 nothing else, after event3 either event2 or event4 must happen, after event4 either event2 or event3 must happen) are irrelevant if no events can occur after event1.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, the only actual sequence is: event1 and then nothing else. Therefore event2, event3, and event4 never occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event4 → event3) is vacuously true because event4 never occurs; an implication with a never-true antecedent is true.
- Since C1 is true, (C1) ∨ (event3) is true regardless of whether event3 occurs.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., event1 occurs in the system)
- C2 asserts: whenever event2 happens, C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the rules / transitions
- Initial event: event4 has happened.
- Transitions:
  - 1 -> 3
  - 3 -> 2
  - 2 -> {3 or 4}
  - 4 -> {2 or 3}

Step 3 — trace reachable events from the initial state
- From initial 4 we can go to 2 or 3.
- From 3 we go to 2, and from 2 to 3 or 4. So the system cycles among events {2,3,4}.
- There is no transition to event1 from anywhere, and event1 did not occur initially. Therefore event1 never occurs in any reachable sequence: C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Event2 is reachable (e.g., 4 -> 2). So there exist runs where event2 happens.
- In those runs event1 does not occur (C1 is false).
- Thus the implication ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The rules give transitions: 4 → {2,3}, 3 → 2, 2 → {3,4}, 1 → 3. Initial event is 4.
- From 4 you can only reach 2 and 3 (and back to 4). There is no transition that ever leads to event1, so event1 never happens in any possible sequence starting from the given initial event.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- C2 says ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" But there are runs where event2 happens (e.g. 4 → 2 → 3 → 2 ...) while event1 never happens. That is a counterexample to the implication, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 always occurs).

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
None of these rules requires event1 to ever occur.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample trace:
- Start: event4 (given).
- Choose after event4 → event2 (allowed).
- After event2 → event3 (allowed).
- After event3 → event2 (forced).
This yields a valid infinite cycle 4,2,3,2,3,... in which event2 occurs but event1 never occurs.

Conclusion:
Because there is a valid trace where event2 happens but event1 does not, the implication in C2 does not hold. Final answer: False"

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e. Event2 happens OR Event2 does not happen)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So the timeline ends at event1.)
- Other rules (about event2/event3/event4) are irrelevant because no events can occur after event1.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event1 happened initially and no events can occur after it, event2 does not happen. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""event2 happens OR event2 does not happen."" This is true because C1 is true (and in classical logic it's a tautology anyway).

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step:

1. Initially event1 happened.
2. After event1, no other events can happen — so the sequence ends immediately after that initial event.
3. Therefore event2 does not happen in any possible continuation. So C1 (Event2 does not happen) is true.
4. C2 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true (and in fact the disjunction is classically always true anyway).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬E2).
- C2 = ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" = (E2) ∨ (¬E2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no event after event1 (including event2) can occur.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event1 happened and no events can follow it, Event2 does not happen. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is E2 ∨ ¬E2, which is a logical tautology, and in this context ¬E2 is true, so C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, it is true that Event1 will eventually happen.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions and trace events:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen → so in the next state event4 occurs.
- After event4, event1 must happen → so following that state event1 will occur.
- After event1, event4 must happen → this makes event1 and event4 alternate thereafter.
- The rule about event2 → event3 is irrelevant here (event2 never occurs in the given trace).

Step 3 — Reasoning about C1 and C2:
- From the initial state, event1 will indeed occur (after event3 → event4 → event1), so C1 is true.
- In the next state (where event4 has just happened), the rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 will eventually occur from that state. Thus C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 says: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the immediate successor state, event1 will still eventually happen.

From the context:
- Initially event3 occurred.
- After event3, event4 must happen (so event4 is inevitable).
- After event4, event1 must happen (so once event4 occurs, event1 is inevitable).
Therefore, starting from the initial state (where event3 happened) event4 will occur at some future time and then event1 will occur after that — so C1 is true in the initial state.

Now consider the next state (one step after the initial state). Whatever event happens next (it could be event4 already, or something else), the obligations coming from the fact that event3 already happened remain: event4 must still occur at some future time, and when it does, event1 must follow. Thus from the next state, event1 still inevitably occurs. Hence C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point Event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate next state, Event1 is still guaranteed to happen eventually).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially, Event3 has occurred.
- After Event3, Event4 must happen.
- After Event4, Event1 must happen.
- After Event1, Event4 must happen (so Event4 and Event1 alternate once reached).
- (There is also: after Event2, Event3 must happen — irrelevant here since Event2 hasn’t occurred.)

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- At the initial state Event3 has happened.
- Therefore the next state must include Event4 (by ""after Event3, Event4 must happen"").
- From that state (where Event4 has occurred), Event1 must happen later (by ""after Event4, Event1 must happen"").
- So from the next state, Event1 is guaranteed to occur at some future time. Hence C1 holds in that next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What the hypothesis says:
   - C1 is just “event1 happens” (written redundantly as “event1 happens and event1 happens”).
   - C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e. event1 holds at every point in time).

2. Conditions from the context:
   - Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial moment).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it occurs, the run cannot continue with other events).
   - The other rules (about event2/event3/event4) don’t force more occurrences of event1 immediately after the initial event.

3. Trace reasoning / counterexample:
   - At time 0: event1 happens (so C1 is true at time 0).
   - Because after event1 no other events can happen, there is no transition that produces another occurrence of event1 at later times. At time 1 (the next moment), event1 does not “happen” again.
   - Since C2 requires that event1 hold at every time point, and it does not hold at time 1, C2 fails.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" (redundant; equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" i.e. in every reachable situation, Event1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event1 happened. So the first (initial) event is Event1.
- After Event1, no other events can happen. So once Event1 has occurred the trace stops — no further events are allowed.
- The other rules (after Event2 → Event3 or Event4; after Event3 → Event1 or Event2 or Event4; after Event4 → Event1) are irrelevant because Events 2–4 can never occur starting from the initial Event1 (and nothing can follow Event1).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- The only possible sequence is the single-event sequence [Event1]. There is no way to reach a state where Event1 does not hold, because no further events can occur after the initial Event1.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in the only reachable situation, and therefore C1 holds always (in all reachable states/traces). So C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 says ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant conjunction; effectively C1 asserts that event1 happens.
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every reachable situation (at all times along all executions) event1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So C1 is true in the initial state.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Thus once that initial event1 has occurred, there are no further events or state changes possible.
- The other rules (after event2 → 3 or 4; after event3 → 1,2,or4; after event4 → 1) are irrelevant here because event2/3/4 can never occur: event1 has already occurred initially and nothing can occur after it.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The only possible execution is the single initial occurrence of event1 (and then termination). There are no reachable states where event1 has not happened, and there are no future events that could make C1 false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because event1 holds in the initial state and no transitions can lead to a state where it would be false, C1 holds in all reachable situations. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happened, so C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false at the initial moment.
- The rules force, after event1, either event2 or event4 must occur next.
- If event2 occurs next, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means the subsequent state has no events — in that state event1 does not happen, so C1 holds there.
- If event4 occurs next, the rule ""after event4, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur after that, and then no further events can happen. Again, at the state after event2 no events occur, so event1 does not happen there and C1 holds.
- In all possible continuations there is therefore a future state where C1 is true.

Thus C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (a proposition that can hold at a particular point in time).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e., at some future point there is a state where Event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened (so C1 is false at the initial moment).
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (execution terminates).
- After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event3 never gets forced).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences starting from the initial event1
- Sequence A: event1 → event2. After event2 the system stops.
- Sequence B: event1 → event4 → event2. After event2 the system stops.

In both sequences, at the state immediately after the first step (when event2 or event4 occurs), event1 is not occurring — so C1 holds at that later state.

Conclusion
- Since in every possible continuation there is a later state where ""Event1 does not happen"", C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step by step:

- The hypothesis C1 is ""Event1 does not happen."" C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. there is some future state where event1 is not happening.
- Initially event1 happened, so C1 is false at the initial moment.
- The rules force that after event1 either event2 or event4 occurs.
  - If event2 occurs next, then by ""after event2, no other events can happen"" the next (and terminal) state has no event1 occurring, so C1 holds there.
  - If event4 occurs next, then ""after event4, event2 must happen,"" so the sequence is event1 → event4 → event2, and after event2 (or already at the state where event4/event2 occur) there is a state where event1 is not happening, so C1 holds.
- In every possible allowed trace there is a future state with no event1, so C1 eventually holds.

- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., Event2 ∧ ¬Event3).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So Event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once Event2 occurs, no further events (including Event3) can occur.
- The other rules (about event1 and event4) are irrelevant because no events can occur after the initial event2.

Trace the sequence:
- Start: event2 occurs (given).
- Because no events can occur after event2, event3 cannot occur at any later time.

Therefore:
- Event2 happens (true).
- Event3 does not happen (true).

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event3) can occur.
- Other rules (about event1 and event4) don't force anything to happen before the initial event2 and impose requirements only if those events occur; they don't contradict the initial event2.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event2 happens initially and is terminal, event3 cannot occur afterward.
- There is no way for event3 to have occurred before the initial event2 (the problem states event2 happened initially).

Conclusion:
- Event2 happens and event3 does not happen, so C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify what's asked
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens AND Event3 does not happen"" (since C1 is ""Event3 does not happen"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 definitely occurs.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event3) can occur.

Step 3 — draw the conclusion
- Because event2 happened and no subsequent events can occur, event3 cannot happen. So both conjuncts of C2 are satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
The hypothesis C2 says ""Event3 does not always happen"" (i.e., C1 is false). 

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- From event1, event2 must follow.
- From event2, either event1 or event3 may follow.
- From event3, event2 must follow.
- (The rule after event4 is irrelevant because event4 never occurs in the initial conditions.)

From these rules there is a valid infinite trace that never includes event3: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... (always choosing the transition 2 -> 1). Since such a trace is allowed, event3 is not guaranteed to always happen. Therefore C1 is false and C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (i.e., every possible sequence must include event3)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True (i.e., C1 is false).

Step 2 — conditions / transition rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3 → event2 must happen.
- (Also: after event4 → one of event1/event2/event3, but event4 never appears in the initial chain.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: event1 → (must) event2.
- From event2 we may choose event1. That gives: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... ad infinitum.
- This infinite sequence never includes event3, and it respects all given rules.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence in which event3 never occurs, C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false. C1 asserts ""Event3 always happens,"" so C2 asserts ""Event3 does not always happen"" (i.e., there is a valid sequence where event3 never occurs).

Examine the rules:
- Initially event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So start: 1 → 2.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. So from 2 we may choose 1.
- After event3, event2 must happen (if 3 occurs).
- The rule about event4 is irrelevant unless event4 ever occurs (no rule forcing it).

Construct a valid sequence that never contains event3:
1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... 
This repeatedly uses the allowed transition 2 → 1 and respects 1 → 2, so it satisfies all constraints while never producing event3.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 says:
C2 is ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"", and C1 is ""Event1 happens and Event4 happens"". So C2 is logically equivalent to ""Event4 happens"" (A or (B and A) ⇔ A).

Step 2 — what the premises say:
""Initially, event4 happened."" So event4 does in fact happen. Also, ""After event4, no other events can happen,"" making event4 terminal.

Step 3 — conclusion:
Since event4 happens, C2 is true (regardless of whether event1 happens). Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1 = (Event1 happens) AND (Event4 happens).
- C2 = (Event4 happens) OR C1. Logically, C2 simplifies to just (Event4 happens) because (A) OR (A AND B) ≡ A.

Step 2 — what the context says:
- ""Initially, event4 happened."" So Event4 has happened (true).
- Other constraints (after event4 no other events can happen, etc.) don't affect the truth of ""Event4 happens"".

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Since Event4 happens is true, C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens and event4 happens.
- C2: Event4 happens or C1 holds. (Logically equivalent to ""Event4 happens"", since C1 implies event4.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event4 happened."" So event4 is true.
- ""After event4, no other events can happen."" That only limits events after event4, it does not negate that event4 occurred.

Step 3 — reasoning about C2:
- C2 is satisfied as soon as event4 happens.
- Since event4 happened initially, C2 is true (regardless of whether event1 happened).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event4 must happen"" forces the next state to be event4. So C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is true.
- C2 requires both C1 and ""event3 happens"" (i.e., that event3 also happens in that next state). The rules specify a single forced next event (event4), and there is no allowance for event3 to also occur in that same next state. Event3 could occur later (after event4), but not in the same next state required by C1.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step by step:
- Hypotheses: C1 = ""Event4 happens in the next state."" C2 = ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" (i.e., both event4 and event3 occur in that next state).
- From the context: initially event3 happened. The rule ""After event3, event4 must happen"" forces the immediate next state to be event4. So C1 is true.
- However, a single state cannot be both event4 and event3. The rules do allow event3 to occur after event4, but that would be the state after the next state (not the same next state).
- Therefore C2 (that both event4 and event3 happen in the next state) is not satisfied.

Final: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (Event4 happens in the next state) AND (event3 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- Rule: after event3, event4 must happen. So the immediate next state must be event4.
- Rule: after event4, either event1 or event3 must happen — but that is the state after the next, not the immediate next.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- The next state is forced to be event4 (so C1 is true).
- But event3 cannot also occur in that same next state (there is no rule allowing event3 simultaneously, and event3 can only occur after event4 in the following state). Thus event3 does not necessarily happen in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify: C1 is ""Event3 does not happen."" C2 is ""C1 holds or event3 happens,"" i.e. (not Event3) OR Event3.

Step 2 — logical observation: (not Event3) OR Event3 is a tautology (always true). Also, from the scenario starting with Event2, Event3 must occur: Event2 → (Event1 or Event4). If Event4 occurs, then Event3 must follow. If Event1 occurs, then (Event3 or Event4), and any Event4 again forces Event3. So Event3 inevitably happens, making C1 false but C2 true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen. (¬E3)
- C2: C1 holds or event3 happens. (¬E3 ∨ E3)

Step 2 — logical observation:
- ¬E3 ∨ E3 is a logical tautology (a proposition or its negation). So C2 is always true regardless of the event system.

Step 3 — (optional) check against the event rules:
- Start: event2.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
  - If event4 happens, then after event4 event3 must happen → E3 occurs.
  - If event1 happens, then after event1 either event3 or event4 must happen:
    - If event3 happens → E3 occurs.
    - If event4 happens → then after event4 event3 must happen → E3 occurs.
- Thus under the given rules event3 necessarily occurs (so C1 is false), but that only further confirms C2 is true (because the disjunction is true if E3 holds).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or Event3 happens. (i.e. ""Event3 does not happen OR Event3 happens"")

Step 2 — examine the conditions (given rules) and initial fact:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- (Also: after event3, either event1 or event4 must happen — not needed for the inevitability below, but consistent.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the start:
- From event2 we must go to event1 or event4.
  - If we go to event4, then by rule event3 must happen.
  - If we go to event1, then from event1 we must go to event3 or event4.
    - If from event1 we go to event3, event3 happens.
    - If from event1 we go to event4, then event3 must happen.
- In every possible branch starting from event2, event3 occurs. Therefore event3 must happen (C1 is false).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""(not Event3) OR (Event3)"". That is a logical tautology (law of excluded middle) and, given the rules, Event3 in fact does happen. Either way, C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The hypothesis C1 says ""Event1 does not happen."" C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point it becomes true that Event1 does not happen).
- From the context: ""Initially, event3 happened."" and ""After event3, no other events can happen.""
- Since event3 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event3, no future event (including event1) can ever occur.
- Therefore C1 is true (event1 does not happen), and hence C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is also true (it holds immediately).
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point from then on, event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So the run stops immediately after that initial event3.)
- Other rules (after event1 no events; after event2 → event3; after event4 → event1) are irrelevant because no events can occur after the initial event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The only possible sequence is: initial event3, then no further events. Event1 never occurs in that sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true in the actual run.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true as well, because C1 already holds from the start (so it certainly holds at some point in the future).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true or false.
- C1 is ""Event1 does not happen."" So C2 asserts that at some point in time, C1 becomes true (i.e., from that point forward, Event1 does not happen—or at least C1 holds at some time).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So event3 is terminal.)
- The other rules (after event1 nothing else; after event2 event3 must happen; after event4 event1 must happen) are irrelevant once event3 has occurred and is terminal, because no further events can occur.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- Because event3 has already happened initially and is terminal, there are no future events at all. In particular, Event1 will never occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true (Event1 never occurs).
- Therefore C1 already holds now, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:

- C2 = ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = (¬event4) ∨ event1.

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate the disjunction:
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Since event1 is true, (¬event4) ∨ event1 is true regardless of whether event4 occurs later.

Final answer: True

Step-by-step:

- Given: initially event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must occur.
- If event2 or event3 occurs, then event4 must occur afterward. If event4 occurs directly, it occurs. Thus in every allowed sequence event4 does occur.
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = (Event4 does not happen) OR (event1 happens). Since event1 did happen, C2 is true regardless of C1.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no further events (including event3 or event4) can occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore event3 does not happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event4.

Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or event4 happens (i.e., (not event3) OR event4).

Examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).

Trace sequence:
- Since event2 happened initially and it forbids any events afterward, no further events (including event3 or event4) can occur.
- Therefore event3 does not happen, so C1 is true.

Conclusion:
- C2 = (C1 or event4) is true because C1 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event4 happens"".
- C1 is ""event3 does not happen"".
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 occurs, the sequence ends.)
- The other rules (after event4 → event3; after event3 → event1 or event4; after event1 → event2 or event3) only matter if those events occur.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event2 happens initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event3 or event4) can occur at any point after the initial event2.
- Therefore event3 does not happen. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 = (C1) OR (event4 happens). C1 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of whether event4 happens.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" We evaluate these relative to the initial state (where event2 has happened).

Step 2 — follow the given rules step by step from the initial state:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event3 must happen → in the next state we have event3.
- Rule: after event3, event1 must happen → in the state after that we have event1.
- (The rest is later: after event1 → event4, after event4 → event2 or event3.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 asks whether event1 happens in the next state. From the chain, the next state (immediately after the initial state) has event3, not event1. So C1 is false.
- C2 is ""event2 happens or C1 holds."" In the next state event2 does not happen (it is event3), and C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (We take these as assertions about the next state; C1 explicitly mentions the next state, so C2 is interpreted the same way.)

Step 2 — conditions (interpreted as “the next event after X must be Y”)
- Initially, event2 happened (current state).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so the next state must be event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so the state after that will be event1).
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace from the initial event2
- Current state: event2.
- Next state (after event2): event3 (by rule).
- Therefore C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false (event3 is next, not event1).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires that in the next state either event2 happens or C1 holds.
- In the next state we have event3, so event2 does not happen and C1 does not hold.
- Hence C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event2 happens in the next state OR C1 holds (i.e., event2 or event1 in the next state).

Step 2 — apply the conditions starting from the initial state:
- Initially, event2 happened (state0).
- ""After event2, event3 must happen"" ⇒ at state1, event3 happens.
- From that, ""After event3, event1 must happen"" ⇒ event1 would happen at state2, not at state1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 for the next state (state1):
- C1 (event1 at state1) is false (state1 has event3).
- C2 is ""event2 at state1 OR C1"". At state1, event2 does not occur and C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the rules. Step-by-step:

1. What is being asked:
   - C1: Event1 does not happen.
   - C2: If event2 happens, then event1 does not happen (i.e. event2 → C1).
   - We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given rules.

2. Examine the rules:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, at least one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
   - After event1 → event4.
   - After event4 → event2.
   - After event3 → event4.

3. Construct a valid sequence consistent with the rules that violates C1:
   - Start: event2 (given).
   - After that, choose event1 (allowed by ""after event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen"").
   - After event1, event4 must happen.
   - After event4, event2 must happen.
   - This produces a valid cycle 2 → 1 → 4 → 2 … in which event1 does occur.

4. Conclusion:
   - Because there exists a rule-consistent sequence where event2 occurs and event1 also occurs, C1 is not guaranteed.
   - Therefore C2 (""if event2 happens then C1 holds"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""
- So C2 asserts: whenever event2 occurs, event1 does not occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event1 → event4 must happen.
- After event4 → event2 must happen.
- After event3 → event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence (counterexample)
- Initially: event2 (given).
- After that we may choose event1 (the rule allows event1 as one of the options).
- If event1 occurs, then event4 must occur, then event2 must occur, etc.
- In this sequence event1 does occur, so C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Because event2 does happen (initially) and there exists a permitted sequence where event1 does happen (making C1 false), the implication ""if event2 happens then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed by the rules.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are testing whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") follows from the context. C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""

1. From the context: initially event2 happens.
2. The rule ""After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen"" allows event1 to occur after event2 (it's one of the allowed choices).
3. If event1 happens, ""after event1, event4 must happen"", then ""after event4, event2 must happen"", and the cycle can continue. Nothing in the context forbids event1 from occurring.
4. Therefore there is a valid sequence where event2 happens and event1 also happens (e.g., initial event2 → event1 → event4 → event2 ...). That makes C1 false in that sequence.
5. Since event2 does happen (initially) but C1 need not hold, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event3 does happen"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event3 happened."" This states event3 does occur.
- Other rules (after event3 no other events can happen, etc.) constrain what can happen after events, but none of them contradict the initial fact that event3 happened.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- Because the scenario explicitly says event3 happened initially, the statement ""Event3 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., C2 asserts that C1 is false, equivalently ""Event3 does happen.""

- ""Initially, event3 happened."" That directly states event3 did occur.
- Other rules (after event1 no further events, after event3 no further events, etc.) do not negate the initial occurrence of event3.

Step 3 — conclude
- Because event3 did happen, C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. event3 does happen) is true.

First identify the hypotheses:

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ""Event3 does happen.""

- Also ""After event3, no other events can happen"" means the sequence ends there, but that doesn't change that event3 has occurred.

Therefore C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false, so C2 (its negation) is true.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens, and the rule ""After event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 next. So event4 does happen — hence C1 (""Event1 happens or event4 happens"") is true.
- From event4 the rule allows either event2 or event3. Choose the branch that returns to event2. Then event2 forces event4 again, and we can repeat the cycle e4 → e2 → e4 → ... forever.
- In that infinite cycle no event1 ever occurs (we always choose e2 after e4 rather than e3 → e1). Thus there is a valid execution where C1 holds (because event4 occurs) but event1 does not occur.
- Therefore the implication C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is not guaranteed and is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The hypothesis C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event4 happens."" C2 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then Event1 happens"" — i.e. (Event1 ∨ Event4) → Event1.

2. From the context: initially Event2 happens. After Event2, Event4 must happen. After Event4, either Event2 or Event3 happens. After Event3, Event1 must happen. After Event1, either Event2 or Event4 happens.

3. Construct a valid execution that makes C1 true but Event1 never occur:
   - Start: Event2 (given).
   - Then, by the rule, Event4 must happen. So C1 holds (via Event4).
   - After Event4 choose Event2 (allowed). After Event2, Event4 must happen again.
   - Repeat Event2 → Event4 indefinitely.

   This cycle (2 → 4 → 2 → 4 …) is consistent with all rules and never produces Event3 or Event1.

4. Because there exists a valid scenario where C1 holds (Event4 occurs) but Event1 does not occur, the implication (C1 → Event1) is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens"" (event1 ∨ event4).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — equivalently (event1 ∨ event4) ⇒ event1.

Step 2 — restate the rules
- Initially event2 occurs.
- event2 ⇒ event4 (after event2, event4 must happen).
- event4 ⇒ (event2 ∨ event3).
- event3 ⇒ event1.
- event1 ⇒ (event2 ∨ event4).

Step 3 — look for a counterexample (C1 true but event1 never happens)
- Start: event2 (given).
- Then by rule, event4 must happen. So event4 occurs — hence C1 is true (because event4 happened).
- From event4 we are allowed to choose event2 again (rule: event4 ⇒ event2 or event3). If we always choose event2 after each event4, we get the infinite loop: event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → ...
- In that loop event3 never occurs, so rule event3 ⇒ event1 never fires; therefore event1 never occurs in this execution.

Step 4 — conclusion
- We have an execution consistent with the rules where C1 is true (event4 happens) but event1 never happens, so (event1 ∨ event4) ⇒ event1 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some point from then on, event1 never happens.

Step 2 — restate the transition rules
- Initially: event3.
- After 3 → must do 2.
- After 2 → one of {1, 3, 4}.
- After 1 → one of {2, 3}.
- After 4 → one of {1, 2, 3}.

Step 3 — look for a run where eventually (indeed permanently) event1 does not occur
- From 3 you must go to 2. From 2 you are allowed to choose 3. From 3 you must go to 2 again. So the infinite alternating sequence …3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2,… is allowed by the rules.
- That sequence never contains event1, so C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") holds immediately and forever on that run. Therefore C1 eventually holds (indeed holds from the start).

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---

---
We need to decide whether ""C1 eventually holds"" is guaranteed by the given rules.

Interpretation:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — understood as ""from now on, event1 never occurs"" (a global/no-future-occurrence property).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some future point after which event1 never occurs (i.e. eventually we reach a suffix where event1 never happens). We must check whether this is guaranteed by the rules (holds on all possible executions).

Reasoning:
1. Start: event3 happens, and then event2 must happen (3 → 2).
2. From event2 the system may choose event1, event3, or event4 (2 → {1,3,4}).
3. If the system ever chooses 2 → 1, then event1 occurs; after event1 we must go to 2 or 3, but event1 already happened and can occur again from 2. It is possible to keep choosing 2 → 1 repeatedly, so there are executions where event1 keeps occurring and thus there is no future point after which event1 never occurs.
4. Because such an execution exists, C1 does not necessarily become true at some eventual point in every run. (Although there are runs that avoid event1 forever—e.g. repeatedly choose 2 → 3 → 2 — C2 asks for eventual holding, i.e. guaranteed, not merely possible.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (a global eventuality)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e. from the immediate successor state, event1 will eventually happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule A: after event2, event1 must happen. (Formally: whenever event2 occurs, eventually event1 must occur.)
- Rule B: after event1, event2 must happen. (They force alternation after those events.)
- Rules for event3/event4 lead back to event2 but are irrelevant unless those events occur.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because event2 occurred initially, Rule A requires that event1 must happen at some later point. So C1 is true in the initial state.
- Moving to the next state does not cancel that outstanding requirement: until event1 actually occurs, the obligation “event1 will eventually happen” still holds. Therefore from the next state it is still guaranteed that event1 will eventually occur (unless it has already occurred in that intervening step, in which case C1 still holds trivially).
- The other rules (event1→event2, event3→event4→event2) do not prevent event1 from eventually occurring; they only create further obligations after those events occur.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X F event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (so at time 0, event2 holds).
- After event2, event1 must happen: whenever event2 holds at some time t, there is some later time t' > t with event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen: ensures alternation 2 → 1 → 2 → ...
- The rules about event3/event4 only matter if event3 occurs; they don't prevent the 2↔1 obligations.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because event2 holds initially and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" requires a later event1, there exists some time n ≥ 1 at which event1 occurs. Thus C1 (F event1) is true at the initial state.
- From the next state (time 1) there remain n−1 ≥ 0 steps until that guaranteed event1. Therefore from the next state event1 still eventually occurs — i.e. X F event1 holds.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.

- C2 = “C1 holds in the next state” (X F event1) — i.e. from the immediate successor state, event1 will eventually occur.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 has just happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from any state where the most recent event was event2, F event1 holds).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2 → event1 forms a guaranteed loop).
- The chain event3 → event4 → event2 only adds more ways to reach event2, which then leads to event1.

Trace/reason:
- From the initial state (event2 just happened) F event1 holds (so C1 is true now).
- Any successor state reachable after these rules is either after event2 or after event1 (or after event4/event3 but those lead into event2). In every case the rules guarantee that event1 will occur again eventually (because event2 forces event1, and event1 forces event2 and hence event1 again).
- Therefore in the next state, F event1 still holds.

Conclusion: C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. If event2 happens, then event4 must happen. So any time event1 occurs, event4 will happen (possibly after event2). Therefore C1 (""If event1 happens, then event4 happens"") is true.
- C2 states: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" But C1 is true unconditionally from the rules above, so C1 holds whether or not event3 happens. Moreover, looking only at the branch after event3: after event3 either event1 or event4 must happen; if event1 happens then by C1 event4 will follow, and if event4 happens then C1 is trivially satisfied. So under either possibility after event3, C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules: after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen; and after event2, event4 must happen. So whenever event1 occurs, event4 will follow (either immediately or after event2). Thus C1 (""If event1 happens, then event4 happens"") is entailed by the context.
- C2 says: if event3 happens, then C1 holds. Since C1 is already true unconditionally from the rules, C2 is therefore true as well (the antecedent event3 is irrelevant because the consequent C1 is always satisfied).
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context: after event1 either event2 or event4 must happen; and after event2 event4 must happen. So any occurrence of event1 is followed (possibly via event2) by event4. Hence C1 is entailed.
- Because C1 is entailed regardless of whether event3 occurs, the conditional ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" is also true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Start state (initial): event1 happens.
2. From the context: after event1, event4 must happen — so the next state (state 1) has event4.
3. C1 is the proposition “If event1 happens, then event3 happens.” In state 1, event1 does not happen (state 1 has event4), so the antecedent of the implication is false.
4. A material implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Therefore C1 is true in state 1.
5. That exactly says C2 (“C1 holds in the next state”) is true.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happens.
- The rules say ""After event1, event4 must happen"", so in the next state event4 occurs.
- C1 is the formula ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens."" In the next state event1 does not happen (event4 does), so the antecedent of C1 is false there.
- A material implication with a false antecedent is true, so C1 holds in that next state.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens."" (a claim about what must follow whenever event1 happens)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial, C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
(One of the ""after event3, event4 must happen"" lines is duplicated; same constraint.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
From the initial event1 we are forced to go to event4 next. From event4 we may choose event2 or event3. If we choose event3 then event3 does happen — but if we choose event2, then from event2 we may choose event4 (instead of event3), and from that event4 we may again choose event2, and so on. So there is a valid infinite trace:
  event1 -> event4 -> event2 -> event4 -> event2 -> ...
in which event3 never occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event3 happens"") is not guaranteed: the trace above is a counterexample (event1 occurs but event3 never does). So C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (the state after event1, where event4 has happened). The same counterexample pattern can be started from that next state (choose event2 after event4 and loop), so C1 does not hold in the next state either.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event4 happens"", where C1 = ""Event4 does not happen"". So C2 is ""(event4 does not happen) OR (event4 happens)"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace sequences
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
  - If event4 happens directly, then event4 has happened.
  - If event1 happens, then after event1 event4 must happen. So this branch also leads to event4.
- Hence from the initial event2, in every possible continuation event4 will occur. Therefore ""event4 happens"" is true given the rules, and ""event4 does not happen"" is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction of a proposition and its negation, and in fact here ""event4 happens"" is true. So C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First, the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") is true.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- (Other rules: after event4 either event2 or event3; after event3 nothing — these don't prevent event4.)

From the initial event2:
- If the branch event4 happens immediately, event4 occurs.
- If the branch event1 happens, then by the rule after event1, event4 must happen.

So in every possible continuation starting from the given initial event2, event4 does occur. Therefore C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false, and ""event4 happens"" is true. Hence C2 (C1 or event4) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to ""Event4 does not happen OR event4 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace sequences:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
  - If event4 happens directly, event4 has happened.
  - If event1 happens, then after event1 event4 must happen, so event4 still happens.
- Therefore in every possible sequence starting from the given initial event2, event4 inevitably happens. (Event3 cannot occur unless after event4, so it does not prevent event4.)

Step 3 — conclude about C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is ""Event4 does not happen OR event4 happens."" Since event4 does happen, that disjunction is true (and it is a logical tautology in any case).

True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the formula ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (i.e. event3 → event3).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point, C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 (event3 → event3) is a propositional tautology: any proposition implies itself. It is true in every state regardless of which event occurs next.
- Because C1 is true at every state, it certainly ""eventually holds"" (indeed it holds immediately and always).

Conclusion
C2 is True.
---
First identify what is being asked.

- C1 is the formula: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a logical implication p → p with p = “event3 happens”.
- C2 is the statement ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some point in the run C1 is true).

Examine the conditions and possible runs from the initial state.

1. Initially event4 happened. The rule after event4 says the next event must be either event2 or event3.
2. If event2 happens then no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
3. If event3 happens then either event1 or event2 must happen next; if event1 happens then event2 must follow (so eventually event2 arrives in that branch too).

So the possible finite runs from the initial state are:
- 4 → 2 (ends), or
- 4 → 3 → 2 (ends), or
- 4 → 3 → 1 → 2 (ends).

Now evaluate C1 in these runs.
- C1 is the implication ""if event3 then event3"", which is a tautology (p → p). An implication p → p is true in any state/trace regardless of whether p actually occurs (it is vacuously true when p is false and trivially true when p is true).
- Therefore C1 holds in every run at every point (in particular it already holds at the start).

Since C1 holds (indeed always), the eventuality ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point in the run the statement C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 has happened.
- From event4, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2 no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen; if event1 happens then event2 must follow, and then stops.

Step 3 — possible event sequences
- event4 → event2 (terminal).
- event4 → event3 → event2.
- event4 → event3 → event1 → event2.
All sequences end (event2 is terminal). Event3 may or may not occur in a run, but these are the only possibilities.

Step 4 — truth of C1 and C2
- C1 (P → P for P=""event3 happens"") is true at every moment (a formula of the form P → P is always true).
- Therefore C1 already holds immediately (and at all times), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True"

We need to check whether ""Event4 does not happen"" holds in the next state, given the rules and the initial event.

1. Identify hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately after the initial one.

2. Examine the conditions:
   - Initially, event4 happened.
   - Rule: After event4, event1 must happen. (This appears twice but duplicates don't change anything.)
   - Other rules (after event1 → one of event2/3/4; after event2 → one of event1/4; after event3 → event1) are not needed for the immediate next step.

3. Trace the sequence:
   - From the initial state where event4 happened, the rule ""After event4, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to have event1.
   - Therefore, in that next state event4 does not happen.

Conclusion: C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" 
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" So we must check whether event4 does not occur in the state immediately following the initial state.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially, event4 happened (so state0 has event4).
- After event4, event1 must happen. Therefore state1 (the next state) must have event1.
- The rule ""after event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen"" constrains state2, not state1.

Step 3 — conclude:
- In state1 we have event1, so event4 does not happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---

- C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, event4 does not happen.

- Initially event4 happened.
- Rule: After event4, event1 must happen. (stated twice, same requirement)
- Other rules (after event1 → one of event2/event3/event4, etc.) are about later steps.

Step 3 — trace the immediate next state
- Because after event4 event1 must happen, the next event (next state) is event1.
- Therefore in that next state event4 does not happen.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""  
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is a logical tautology: P → P is always true (whether P is true or false). There is no temporal shift in C1 as written; it asserts a proposition that is true at any state.

Step 3 — apply ""eventually""
- ""Eventually C1"" means there is some point (including the present) at which C1 holds. Because C1 is true at every point (a tautology), it already holds now and thus certainly holds at some future/accessible point.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (an implication from event2 to event2)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point in the run, C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula ""event2 → event2"" is a logical tautology: it is true whenever evaluated (an instance of A → A).
- In particular, an implication is true whether or not event2 actually occurs (if event2 doesn't occur the antecedent is false and the implication is true; if event2 occurs the antecedent and consequent are both true).

Step 3 — apply to the system
- The allowed sequences (starting with event1 and then following the given rules) do not affect the truth of the tautology ""event2 → event2"": it holds at every point in every sequence.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Since C1 is true now and at all times, C1 certainly holds at some time in the future (indeed immediately).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (a formula of the form p → p.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" i.e., at some point in the execution, C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula p → p is a logical tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether p (event2 happens) is true or false. So C1 is true at every state/time.

Step 3 — trace/consider sequences
- The system constraints on event sequences are irrelevant to the truth of C1, because C1 holds in all states (even states where event2 never occurs).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 holds at every point (in particular at the initial point), ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1) What C2 says:
- C1 = ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. there is a point after which no Event3 occurs (equivalently: eventually always ¬Event3).

2) The rules (given):
- Initially: event4 happened.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2: event1 must happen.
- After event1: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: event2 must happen.

3) Can C2 be guaranteed? No, because there are two possible cycles:
- A cycle that avoids event3 entirely: 4 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 2 → 1 → ... (choose 4 after each 1). In this execution event3 never happens, so C1 (and hence C2) can hold on that run.
- A cycle that repeats event3 forever: 4 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → ... (choose 1 after 4, and 3 after 1). In this execution event3 keeps occurring, so C1 never holds and C2 is false on this run.

Because there exists an allowed execution in which event3 continues to occur (so ¬C1 forever), C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" means event3 never occurs (a global/always property).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means there is a point in the future after which C1 is true — i.e., from some point on event3 never occurs (equivalently: event3 occurs only finitely many times).

Step 2 — examine the rules / transition graph
- Initial event: 4.
- From 4 → either 1 or 2.
- From 2 → 1.
- From 1 → either 3 or 4.
- From 3 → 2.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- It is possible to avoid event3 forever: 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... (always choose 4 from 1). In such a run C1 holds (event3 never happens).
- It is also possible to have event3 occur infinitely often: 4 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → ... (always choose 3 from 1). In this run event3 keeps happening, so C1 never holds and there is no point after which event3 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exist valid runs where event3 continues to occur forever, it is not guaranteed that eventually event3 will cease. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Transitions (from the conditions): 1 -> {3,4}, 3 -> {2}, 4 -> {1,2}, 2 -> {1}. Start at 4.
- There is a run that repeatedly visits event3: 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> ... so event3 keeps happening forever. On that run C1 (""event3 does not happen"") never becomes true, so it never ""eventually holds.""
- Because such a run exists, it is not guaranteed that eventually event3 will cease to happen. Therefore C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — facts and rules
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is already true in every allowed sequence.
- After event2, one of event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen (so a 2→3→1→2 loop is possible).
- After event4, nothing else happens (terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event4 happens."" Because event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1, then event2 happens."" An implication is true whenever the consequent (event2 happens) is true. Since event2 did happen initially, the consequent is true, so the implication holds.
- Could C1 be true while event2 is false? No — initial fact fixes event2 as having happened in all runs, so there is no allowed scenario where C1 holds but event2 does not.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is ""event2 happens or event4 happens"". C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event2"" (i.e. (event2 ∨ event4) → event2).
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in every allowed history/event sequence event2 has already occurred.
- Therefore C1 is already true (because event2 happened), and event2 is true as well. The implication (event2 ∨ event4) → event2 is thus satisfied.
- There is no allowed history consistent with the context where C1 is true and event2 is false (event2 is true at the start in all cases), so C2 holds.

Hence C2 is True.
---
True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened, so the statement ""event2 happens"" is true in this scenario.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens or event4 happens"") is true (because event2 happens).
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 indeed happens (from the initial fact), the implication is true.
- There is no allowed sequence consistent with the rules in which event2 never happens (it happened initially), so there is no counterexample to the implication.

Hence C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 asserts ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., event1 never occurs).
- C2 asserts that C1 will eventually hold (i.e., at some point it becomes true that event1 does not happen).
- From the context: initially event3 happened. The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur after the initial event3.
- Therefore event1 does happen, so C1 is false. Since C1 is false and event1 is guaranteed to occur, C1 cannot become true later, so C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur.
- After that event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2.
- After event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 again.
- Thus events 1 and 2 alternate (and event1 occurs repeatedly). Event4 is irrelevant because nothing forces it to occur.
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is therefore false, and there is no future time after which event1 never happens. Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
First, interpret the hypotheses:

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — i.e. at that point/eventually, event1 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. there is a future point after which event1 does not happen (equivalently, eventually event1 stops occurring forever).

Now follow the conditions and trace the forced events:

1. Initially event3 happened.
2. The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen (so event1 does occur).
3. The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 next.
4. The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 again.
5. Steps 3–4 produce an inevitable loop: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... so event1 keeps occurring (infinitely often).

Because event1 does occur and in fact repeats forever, it is impossible that there will be a future point after which event1 never happens. Therefore C1 can never hold permanently, and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true.
- Rules: after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. Also, after event4, event2 must happen. And after event2, event4 must happen (so 2 and 4 force each other).
- Therefore from event1 you always get event2 eventually (either directly event2, or event4 then event2). So C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is true as well.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- Since event1 actually happened (and C1 also holds), the disjunction ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer: True

We are asked whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

1) Identify C1 and C2:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds.

2) Relevant facts from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen. (2↔4 forces an alternation once reached.)
- The rule about event3 is irrelevant because event3 does not occur in the initial information.

3) Reasoning about C1:
- From event1, the rules force either event2 immediately or event4 then (because after event4, event2 must happen) event2. In both possible continuations event2 occurs after event1. Therefore the implication ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" is true — C1 holds.

4) Conclusion about C2:
- C2 is the disjunction ""event1 happens or C1 holds."" We already have event1 happening (initial fact) and we also showed C1 holds. A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true, so C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 states: ""If event4 happens, then event2 happens."" But the context says: after event4 either event1 or event3 must happen — event2 is not required after event4. So C1 is not generally true.
- C2 states: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" To refute C2 it suffices to find a permitted sequence where event3 happens but C1 is false.
- Counterexample sequence starting from the initial event2 (allowed by the context):
  - event2 → choose event4 (after event2, event4 is allowed)
  - event4 → choose event3 (after event4, event3 is allowed)
  - Now event3 has happened, but the earlier event4 was followed by event3, not event2, so C1 (""if event4 then event2"") is false in this run.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. ""If event3 happens then event4 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — restate the rules
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event1, the next event must be event3.
- After event2, the next event must be event3.
- After event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2
- Start: initial state = event4.
- From event4 choose next = event1 (allowed).
- After event1 the next must be event3 → now event3 happens (antecedent of C2 is true).
- After this event3 we may choose next = event1 (allowed by the rule after event3).
- In that situation, the ""next state"" after the event3 is event1, not event4, so C1 (event4 in the next state) is false while the antecedent (event3 happened) was true.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true (we produced a reachable case where antecedent true and consequent false).

Final answer:
False
---
You ask whether C2 (""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"") follows from the given constraints. C1 is ""Event4 happens in the next state."" So C2 asserts: whenever event3 happens, the next state must be event4.

Reasoning:
- Initial state: event4.
- Transition rules (nondeterministic choices):
  - After event3 → next ∈ {event1, event2, event4}.
  - After event1 → next = event3.
  - After event2 → next = event3.
  - After event4 → next ∈ {event1, event2, event3}.

Because ""either"" indicates a choice, after event3 the next state may be event1 or event2 as well as event4. A concrete counterexample sequence shows C2 fails:
- Start: event4 (initial).
- Choose next = event1 (allowed by after event4).
- After event1 → next = event3.
- After this event3 → choose next = event1 (allowed by after event3).

Here we had an occurrence of event3 whose next state is event1, not event4. That violates C2. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the constraints.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., whenever event3 occurs, event4 must occur in the next state)

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event1, the next event must be event3.
- After event2, the next event must be event3.
- After event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.

Step 3 — find a counterexample trace
- Start: event4 (given).
- After event4 we may choose event1 (allowed).
- After event1, we must have event3.
  So we have the sequence: event4 → event1 → event3.
- Now event3 has occurred. C2 would require that the next event is event4.
  But after event3 we are allowed to choose event1 (or event2) instead of event4.
- Choose event1 after event3 (allowed); then the next event is event1, not event4.

This shows a reachable situation where event3 occurs but event4 does not happen next, so the implication in C2 does not always hold.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is the implication (event2 -> event4).
- C2 is (event4 -> C1), i.e. event4 -> (event2 -> event4).
- In propositional logic this is the tautology A -> (B -> A). If A (event4) is true, then regardless of B (event2), the implication (B -> A) is true.
- Therefore whenever event4 happens, C1 holds. The given context does not contradict this.

So C2 is True.
---
You're asking whether C2 (""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context. Short answer: True.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. C1 is the statement: ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens."" Write it as (event2 → event4).
2. C2 is the statement: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" Write it as (event4 → (event2 → event4)).
3. In propositional logic the formula p → (q → p) is a tautology. Concretely:
   - Assume event4 happens.
   - To check C1, assume event2 happens. But since event4 already happens, the consequent of C1 (event4) is true regardless of whether event2 happened. Thus (event2 → event4) is true.
   - Therefore, under the assumption that event4 happens, C1 holds.
4. This reasoning does not depend on the other given temporal constraints; it follows from the logical form of the statements.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 says: if event4 happens, then C1 holds. C1 is ""if event2 happens, then event4 happens.""
- Assume event4 happens. To show C1, assume event2 happens. But we already assumed event4 happens, so the implication ""if event2 then event4"" is satisfied (the consequent is true).
- Therefore under the assumption event4, C1 is true. Hence C2 is true (this is an instance of the propositional tautology A -> (B -> A))."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 happens or event2 happens.
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds.
We are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing happens after event2).
- The other rules (what happens after event3 or event4 or event1) are irrelevant because they only apply if those events occur later.

Step 3 — Reasoning through the sequence
- Since event2 happened initially, the disjunction in C1 (event3 or event2) is satisfied by event2. Therefore C1 is True.
- C2 is the disjunction (event3 or C1). Because C1 is True, C2 is True regardless of event3.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The context states ""Initially, event2 happened"" and also ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So the only event that actually occurs is event2.
2. C1 is ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Since event2 does happen, C1 is true.
3. C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" C1 holds (from step 2), so C2 is true regardless of whether event3 happens.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event3) OR (event2).
- C2 = (event3) OR (C1).

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Thus no later event matters; in particular we don't need event3 to be true.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 = event3 OR event2. Since event2 is true, C1 is true.
- C2 = event3 OR C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 is: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- So C2 asserts: event2 → (event1 does not happen). In other words, whenever event2 occurs, event1 never occurs in that run.

Step 2 — relevant rules from the context
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (So event2 can occur only immediately after event1.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- Initial event4 happened.

Step 3 — reasoning about possible sequences
- From initial event4 we must have event3 next.
- From event3 we could go to event1 (or back to event4). If we choose event1, then from event1 we may choose event2.
- Thus a valid sequence is: event4 → event3 → event1 → event2 → ...
- In that sequence event2 occurs and event1 also occurred (just before it).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence where event2 happens and event1 also happens, the implication ""if event2 happens then event1 does not happen"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"", C2 means: whenever event2 occurs, event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — use the rules to construct a possible sequence:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event3 must happen → sequence: 4 → 3.
- After event3, we may choose event1 → 4 → 3 → 1.
- After event1, we may choose event2 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 2.

Now event2 has happened, but event1 already occurred earlier. Also, after event2 we may choose event1 again (since after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen), so event1 can occur after event2 as well.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules (we produced a valid sequence where event2 occurs and event1 does occur), so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The rules give transitions: 1 -> {2,3}, 2 -> {1,3}, 3 -> {1,4}, 4 -> {3}, and the initial event is 4.
- From the initial 4 we must have 3 next. From 3 we may choose 1. From 1 we may choose 2.
- That yields a valid sequence 4, 3, 1, 2 in which both event1 and event2 occur.
- C2 asserts ""if event2 happens, then event1 does not happen."" The sequence above is a counterexample (event2 happens and event1 does happen), so C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened (call that state S0). C1 asserts ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. in S1).
- From the rules, after event2 (S0) the next state S1 may be event1, event3, or event4. So S1 can be event1.
- Take the allowed trace S0: event2 → S1: event1. In this trace the antecedent of C2 (""event1 happens"") is true (S1 is event1) but C1 (""event2 happens in the next state S1"") is false (S1 is event1, not event2).
- Therefore the implication ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed and is false (counterexample above).
---
Step-by-step:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state.
- From the rules: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. That means a next-state event after event1 can be event3 (not necessarily event2).
- Counterexample trace: initially event2 (given), then event1 (allowed), then event3 (allowed). Here event1 occurs but event2 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false in that trace.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
First identify the claims:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., if event1 happens, then event2 happens in the next state.)

Examine the rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3} (so event2 is possible but not guaranteed).
- After event3, next is one of {event1, event4}.
- After event4, no further events occur.

We need to check whether C2 (the implication) is always true given these rules. Provide a counterexample consistent with the rules:
- Start: initial event2 (given).
- Next state: choose event1 (allowed after event2).
- After event1: choose event3 (allowed after event1).

In this sequence, when event1 happens, the following state is event3, not event2 — so C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false in this case. That makes the implication ""if event1 happens then event2 happens next"" false (because event1 can be followed by event3 instead).

Therefore C2 is False."

- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Eventually Event1 happens"".

Step 2 — apply the conditions:
- Initially Event2 happened.
- The rule ""After Event2, Event1 must happen"" therefore requires Event1 to happen (after that initial Event2).

Thus Event1 will occur, so C1 holds, and therefore C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is True.

Final answer: True
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 = ""Eventually C1 holds"" i.e. ""Eventually event1 happens"".

Now examine the conditions as transitions (interpreting ""after X, Y must happen"" as the next event):
- Initially: event2 occurs.
- 2 -> 1 (after event2, event1 must happen).
- 1 -> {2, 3, 4} (after event1 one of these must happen).
- 3 -> {2, 4}.
- 4 -> 3.

Trace from the start:
- Start: event2 (given).
- From 2, event1 must happen next. So event1 does happen immediately after the initial event2.

Therefore C1 (event1) holds at that next step, so C2 (""eventually C1"") is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" is just event1 happens).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., eventually event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Other rules (after event1 → one of event2/3/4, after event3 → one of event2/4, after event4 → event3) do not prevent event1 from occurring; they only constrain what must follow later.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (at the next step or eventually immediately following).
- Therefore event1 does happen, so C1 holds at some point.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because event1 will occur following the initial event2, C2 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1 is “Event4 does not happen.” C2 is “C1 eventually holds,” i.e. at some point from then on event4 never occurs (event4 occurs only finitely many times, and after some time it never occurs).
- From the rules we have transitions: 1 -> 2, 2 -> {1,4}, 3 -> {1,4}, 4 -> {1,3}. Initially we are at event3.
- There are runs where event4 never occurs (e.g. 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...), so C1 (and hence C2) can hold on some executions.
- But C2 asks whether eventually event4 will stop in all possible executions. That is not guaranteed because there are executions in which event4 keeps occurring forever, for example the infinite run 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... where event4 occurs infinitely often and C1 never becomes true.
- Because a counterexample run exists, C2 is not necessarily true.

Therefore C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the current state, after the immediate next event, event4 will eventually happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2, event4 must happen (at some future point).
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — consider the possible immediate next events from the initial state
- If the next event is event4, then event4 has already occurred in that next state, so ""event4 eventually happens"" is true.
- If the next event is event2, the rule ""after event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur later, so ""event4 eventually happens"" is true in that next state as well.

There is no allowed next event that avoids event4 eventually.

Conclusion
- In every possible next state, C1 holds. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3, the rules force the next event to be either event2 or event4.
  - If the next state is event4, then ""event4 eventually happens"" is immediately true.
  - If the next state is event2, the rule ""after event2, event4 must happen"" ensures event4 will occur in the following step.
- In both possible next states, event4 is guaranteed to occur at some future point, so C1 holds in the next state.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Step-by-step:

- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3, the system must go to either event2 or event4 next.
- If the next state is event4, then event4 has already happened (so ""event4 eventually happens"" holds).
- If the next state is event2, the rule ""after event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur immediately afterward (so again ""event4 eventually happens"" holds).
- Therefore, in every possible next state (after one step from the initial state), event4 will eventually happen. Hence C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step‑by‑step:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- But the rules say: after event1, event2 must happen. So immediately after that initial event1, event2 occurs — therefore not every event is event1.
- A concrete trace: 1 → 2 → 3 (after 2 choose 3, then stop). In this trace event1 does not “always” happen (it does not occur at every step and does not recur).
- Thus C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
The hypothesis C2 says: ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event1 always happens."" So C2 asks whether it is not the case that Event1 always happens.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So right after that initial event1, event2 occurs.)
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.

Trace possible sequences starting from the initial event1:
- We have at least the prefix: event1 → event2 (because event2 must follow event1).
- That second event is event2, which is not event1. Therefore there exists at least one occurrence in the sequence that is not event1.

Because there is a required event2 immediately after the initial event1, it is impossible that ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., that every event occurrence is event1). Thus C1 is false, so C2 (the negation) is true.

Final answer: True
---
First, interpret the statements:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — read as “Event1 occurs at every step (in every position) of the execution.”
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., Event1 is not the case at every step.

Examine the rules and trace a possible execution:
1. Initially event1 happened. (Given.)
2. After event1, event2 must happen. So the next event is event2 — at that step, event1 does not occur.
3. After event2 we can choose event3 (for example). If we choose event3, no further events happen (terminal).

This execution is: event1 → event2 → event3. At the second step event1 does not occur, so Event1 does not occur at every step. Therefore C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens and event1 happens. (C1 ≡ Event2 ∧ Event1)
- C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens. (C2 ≡ (Event2 ∧ Event1) → Event1)

Step 2 — Logical analysis:
- The implication (A ∧ B) → B is a tautology in classical logic: if both A and B are true, then B is necessarily true.
- Here, C1 already asserts Event1. So whenever C1 holds, Event1 holds by definition.
- (Even if C1 could never occur, the implication would still be true because a false antecedent makes the implication true.)

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
First identify C2: it says ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" So C2 is the implication (event2 ∧ event1) → event1.

An implication of the form (A ∧ B) → B is a logical tautology: whenever A ∧ B is true, B is certainly true; and if A ∧ B is false the implication is also true. Therefore C2 is always true regardless of the given event rules.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the pieces:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., event2 ∧ event1).
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" (i.e., (event2 ∧ event1) → event1).

Step 2 — Logical check:
- From C1 (event2 ∧ event1) you already have event1 as a conjunct. So whenever C1 is true, event1 is necessarily true.

Conclusion: C2 is True."

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen"" fixes the immediate next state to be either event2 or event4 (not event1).
- Therefore in the next state event1 does not occur, so C1 holds in the next state.

Hence C2 is True.
---
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen"" means the immediate next state contains either event2 or event4 (not event1).
- In either case (next state = event2 or next state = event4), event1 does not occur in that next state.
- C1 is the statement ""Event1 does not happen."" Therefore C1 is true in the next state.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true. C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"", so C2 says ""Event1 does not happen in the next state.""

Given:
- Initially (state S0) event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen (in the next state S1).

Therefore S1 must be event2 or event4. In either case, event1 does not occur in S1. Hence C1 holds in the next state.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4 one of {event1, event2, event3} must occur.
  - If event3 occurs, event3 has happened.
  - If event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 next.
  - If event2 occurs, the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" forces either event3 immediately or event1 (which then forces event3).
- Thus from the initial event4, no matter which allowed choice is taken, event3 will occur (within at most two steps).
- After event3, event4 must occur, and the same reasoning repeats indefinitely, so every possible run contains event3 repeatedly.
- Therefore ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is true, so ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C2 is the negation of C1. C2 asks: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is True iff event3 is not guaranteed to occur in all allowed sequences; C2 is False iff event3 is guaranteed to occur.

Step 2 — restate the transition rules (deduplicated)
- Initially event4 occurs.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must occur.
- After event1, event3 must occur.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3} must occur.
- After event3, event4 must occur.

Step 3 — trace possibilities from the initial event4
- From the initial event4 you can choose event1, event2, or event3.
  - If you choose event3, event3 occurred.
  - If you choose event1, then by the rule after event1, event3 must occur next — so event3 occurs.
  - If you choose event2, then after event2 you must choose either event1 or event3. If you choose event3, event3 occurs; if you choose event1, that forces event3 next. So starting from event2 you also inevitably reach event3.
- After any event3, the rule forces event4, and the same reasoning repeats.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Every possible continuation from the initial event4 leads to event3 (in fact, event3 recurs in every cycle). Thus event3 is guaranteed to occur in all allowed sequences, so C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1 says ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at every relevant moment).
- We are told ""Initially, event4 happened."" That initial moment is a moment when event3 did not happen.
- Therefore C1 is false (event3 does not hold at that initial time).
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true."

Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: both Event1 and Event4 happen.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., it is not the case that both Event1 and Event4 happen).

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially Event4 happened (so Event4 has happened).
- After Event4, one of Event1, Event2, or Event3 must happen. Therefore Event1 can occur directly after the initial Event4.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- It is possible (and consistent with the rules) that Event1 occurs after the initial Event4, so C1 can be satisfied.
- Therefore the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not true.

Final answer: False
---
We are given only rules about what events may follow others and that initially event4 happened.

C1 asserts: both event1 happens and event4 happens.
C2 asserts: C1 does not hold (i.e., it's not the case that both event1 and event4 happen).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context, event4 did happen initially, so the ""event4 happens"" part of C1 is already satisfied.
- After event4, the rules allow either event1, event2, or event3 to happen. So it is possible to choose event1 next. If we do, then event1 happens as well.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence (initial event4, then event1) in which both event4 and event1 happen, so C1 can be true.
- Because C1 can be true, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed; in fact C2 is false in any sequence where we choose event1 after event4.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not (Event1 and Event4)).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 happened (so event4 has occurred).
- From event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence:
- Start: event4 (given).
- After that, choose event1 (allowed by the rule after event4).
- Now both event4 (initial) and event1 (next) have happened, so C1 holds in this sequence.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. But we have a valid sequence where C1 does hold, so C2 is not true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 is ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some point in the timeline C1 is true).
- Initially, event1 already happened, so C1 holds immediately (there exists a time when event1 happened).
- Therefore C1 is satisfied (and hence eventually holds). Any later execution choices (even if they loop event2↔event4) do not undo the fact that event1 occurred.

So C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event3 happens or Event1 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in time, Event3 or Event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- Transitions: 1 -> {2 or 3}, 2 -> 4, 3 -> 4, 4 -> {1 or 2}.

Step 3 — reason about the sequences:
- Because Event1 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the initial moment (Event1 holds).
- Therefore C1 holds at time 0, so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied immediately.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point (now or later) either event3 or event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened at the initial time, C1 is already true at that time.
- ""Eventually"" only requires that C1 hold at some time (including the present). Thus C2 is satisfied immediately.
(For completeness: the transitions allow other runs e.g. an infinite loop event2→event4→event2→… that avoids future event1/event3, but that does not matter because C1 already held initially.)

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" (interpreted as: no event4 ever occurs in the execution.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. at some point onward, C1 is true — in particular if C1 is true from the start, C2 is satisfied.)

Step 2 — read the rules / constraints
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next event after event1 is event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next event after event2 is event1).
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Starting with event1, the rules force the next event to be event2, then back to event1, then event2, etc. So the only reachable behavior following the rules is the infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- Event3 can only occur immediately after an event4 (there is no rule that allows event3 directly after event1 or event2).
- Event4 would have to occur at some step, but at every step we are at event1 or event2 and the rules force the next event to be the other (event2 after event1, event1 after event2). Thus there is no allowed point at which event4 can occur.

Step 4 — conclude
- Therefore event4 never occurs, so C1 is true.
- If C1 is true (indeed true from the start), then ""C1 eventually holds"" is also true.

Final answer: True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First, identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e. at some state s, the immediate successor s+1 has event4).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. there exists some future state where its next state has event4).

Examine the conditions and trace possible sequences starting from the initial state:
1. Initially event4 happened at s0.
2. After event4, event2 must happen → s1 has event2.
3. After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen → s2 is either event1 or event3.

- If s2 = event1, then after event1 event4 must happen → s3 has event4. Hence at s2 the ""next state has event4"" (C1 holds at s2), so C1 holds at that future point.
- If s2 = event3, then after event3 either event1 or event4 must happen:
  - If s3 = event4, then C1 holds at s2 (its next state s3 has event4).
  - If s3 = event1, then after event1 s4 = event4, so C1 holds at s3.

In every possible branch there is a state whose immediate successor has event4. Therefore C1 will occur at some future state, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" — a proposition about the immediate successor state of some time point.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future time point at which its immediate next state satisfies C1 (i.e., the next state is event4).

Given facts / rules
- Initially (time 0): event4 happened.
- After event4 → event2 must happen (so time1 = event2).
- After event2 → either event1 or event3 happens (time2 = event1 or event3).
- After event1 → event4 must happen (the state after event1 is event4).
- After event3 → either event1 or event4 happens (the state after event3 is event1 or event4).

Trace / case analysis from the initial state (time0 = event4)
1. time1 = event2 (forced).
2. time2 is either:
   - Case A: time2 = event1. Then by ""after event1, event4 must happen"", time3 = event4. So at time2, the next state (time3) is event4 — C1 holds at time2.
   - Case B: time2 = event3. Then at time3 either:
       • time3 = event4 ⇒ at time2 the next state is event4, so C1 holds at time2; or
       • time3 = event1 ⇒ then time4 = event4 (by after event1 → event4), so C1 holds at time3.

In every possible branch, we reach a time point whose immediate next state is event4. Therefore C1 holds at some future time, so C2 is true.

First, identify the hypothesis:

- C1 = ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (a property that can be true or false at a given point in a run)
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" (there is a time after which C1 is true at every subsequent step)

Now examine the transition rules (interpreting ""After X, Y must happen"" as the next event must be one of the given options):

- Start: event1 happens initially.
- After event1 → either event3 or event4.
- After event3 → event2.
- After event2 → event4.
- After event4 → either event1 or event2.

Trace possible sequences. From the initial event1 choose the branch event4, then choose the branch event2, and keep repeating the 4→2 choice:

Sequence: 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, ...

This yields an infinite loop of 2 and 4 with no further occurrence of event1 after the initial one. In that loop, whenever event2 happens there is no event1 following (neither immediately nor ever thereafter). Thus C1 is false at those times, and because the loop can continue forever C1 never becomes permanently true. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False."

- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (equivalent to ""Event3 happens or event1 happens"").

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 does happen at least once.)
- Other rules govern what can follow, but they don't negate the initial event3.

- Since event3 happened initially, C1 is true.
- Therefore ""C1 or event1"" (C2) is true regardless of whether event1 later occurs.

- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — i.e., (event3) or event1.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Hypothesis:  
  - C1: ""Event3 happens or event4 happens.""  
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither Event3 nor Event4 happens).

- From the context: initially Event1 happened. After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen.
  - If Event3 happens immediately, then C1 is true (Event3 happened).
  - If Event2 happens instead, then the rule ""After Event2, Event3 must happen"" forces Event3 to happen; again C1 is true.

- Therefore in every possible trace starting from the given conditions, Event3 occurs (so Event3 or Event4 is satisfied). C1 necessarily holds.

Conclusion
C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 happens or event4 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., neither event3 nor event4 happens).

Step 2 — use the conditions
- Event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
  - If event3 happens immediately then C1 is true.
  - If event2 happens, then the rule “after event2, event3 must happen” forces event3 to happen, so C1 is still true.

Thus in every allowed sequence event3 occurs. Therefore C1 is true, so C2 (its negation) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" (i.e. every time event1 occurs it is followed by event4).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there will be some future point from which C1 is true).

We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 occurs.
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
From the initial event3 we may choose event1. After that, the rules allow choosing event2 (not forced to choose event4). From event2 we may choose event1. So a valid infinite sequence is:
- event3, event1, event2, event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
This sequence obeys all rules at every step and never contains event4.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2 on that sequence
- C1 (""if event1 then event4"") is false on this sequence because event1 occurs repeatedly without being followed by event4.
- Therefore C1 does not become true at any future point on that run, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false (not guaranteed).

Conclusion
False
---
First identify the question: C2 asserts that ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" We must decide whether, given the constraints, C1 will inevitably become true from some point onward (i.e., whether there is any possible future in which C1 never becomes true). If we can exhibit a valid infinite event sequence consistent with the rules in which C1 never holds, then C2 is false.

Examine the rules as transitions:
- Start: event3.
- From 3 → {1, 2}.
- From 2 → {1, 4}.
- From 1 → {2, 4}.
- From 4 → {2}.

Provide a counterexample run that obeys all rules but never makes C1 true. After the initial 3, choose 1, then choose 2, then 1, then 2, ...:

Sequence: 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ... (infinite alternation of 1 and 2).

This sequence obeys all constraints:
- After 3 we did 1 (allowed).
- After every 1 we do 2 (allowed).
- After every 2 we do 1 (allowed).
- We never do event4.

C1 (""If event1 happens, then event4 happens"") is false along this run because event1 occurs many times but event4 never occurs. Therefore C1 does not hold, and it never starts holding at any later point in this run. So C1 does not eventually hold in all possible executions.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

First, restate the hypothesis precisely:

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" (read as: whenever an event1 occurs it is followed by event4)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (read as: at some future point C1 becomes true and from then on holds)

Now examine the rules (transition choices):

- Start: event3 happens.
- After event3: next is either event1 or event2.
- After event1: next is either event2 or event4.
- After event2: next is either event1 or event4.
- After event4: next must be event2.

We need to know whether eventually it becomes guaranteed that every time event1 happens it is followed by event4. Produce a counterexample execution if possible.

Counterexample execution (all choices allowed by the rules):
- Start: 3
- Choose after 3: 1 (3 -> 1)
- After 1 choose 2 (allowed): 1 -> 2
- After 2 choose 1: 2 -> 1
- After 1 choose 2 again: 1 -> 2
- Repeat forever: ... -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...

In this infinite run, every occurrence of event1 is followed by event2, not event4. Thus C1 is false on every occurrence of event1 in this run, and C1 never becomes permanently true. Because such a run is allowed by the rules, C1 does not necessarily eventually hold.

Final answer: False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"". C1 is ""Event3 does not happen."" So C2 is asking whether in every allowed trace (given the context) event3 never occurs.

Step 2 — restate the constraints
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, event4 must happen (i.e., event4 must occur at some point following event2).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible occurrences of event3
- Because event2 has already occurred initially, the requirement ""after event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur at some point after that initial event2.
- Both event3 and event4 are terminal: once event3 occurs, no further events can occur; likewise for event4.
- If event3 were to occur anywhere after event2, it would be terminal and therefore prevent the required event4 from occurring after event2. That would violate the constraint that event4 must happen after event2.
- Could event3 have happened before event2? No — the context says initially event2 happened, so we cannot place event3 earlier than that in any allowed trace.
- The only way to satisfy ""after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen"" while also satisfying ""after event2, event4 must happen"" is, if event1 occurs after event2, to choose event4 (not event3). Thus no allowed trace can include event3.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In every trace consistent with the given constraints, event3 does not occur. Therefore C1 always holds.

Final answer: True
---

---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rule ""After event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur at some later point.
- Both event3 and event4 are terminal: ""After event3, no other events can happen"" and ""After event4, no other events can happen.""
- Once event4 occurs (which must happen after event2), no further events can occur, so event3 cannot occur after event4.
- Could event3 occur before event2? No — event2 is stated to have happened initially, so there is no earlier time for event3.
- Could event1 cause event3 to occur before event4? If event1 occurred before event4 and then produced event3, that would prevent the required event4 from ever occurring (because event3 is terminal), contradicting the requirement that event4 must happen after event2. So event3 cannot be produced without violating the given rules.

Therefore event3 does not happen in any allowed execution, so C1 always holds. C2 is True."

Step 1 — interpret C2:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" (i.e., at the current moment/event, event4 is not happening).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some future point after which event4 never happens (event4 stops occurring forever).

Step 2 — use the transition rules (write last-event -> possible next events):
- 4 -> {1, 3}
- 1 -> {3, 4}
- 3 -> {2, 4}
- 2 -> {4}

Step 3 — reason about recurrence of event4:
- Start: initially event4 happened.
- After any occurrence of 4 we go to 1 or 3.
  - If 4 -> 1 then either 1 -> 4 (immediate return) or 1 -> 3 -> (2 or 4). In the 1->3->2 case, 2 -> 4. So from 1 a 4 occurs within at most 2 steps.
  - If 4 -> 3 then either 3 -> 4 (immediate return) or 3 -> 2 -> 4. So from 3 a 4 occurs within at most 2 steps.
- Therefore, whenever a 4 occurs, another 4 is guaranteed to occur within at most two transitions. Thus event4 recurs infinitely often and cannot be permanently avoided.

Conclusion:
- It is not the case that eventually event4 stops happening. C2 is False.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or Event4 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the timeline, Event1 or Event4 occurs).

Step 2 — examine given conditions:
- Initially Event1 has happened.
- The rules force a cycle: Event1 → Event2 → Event4 → Event3 → Event1 → ... so Event4 will also happen later, and Event1 recurs.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- Because Event1 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the initial point.
- Therefore C1 holds at some point (now), so ""eventually C1"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event4 happens"" (a state that is true at any time when either event1 or event4 has occurred).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some time (including the initial moment), C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial moment).
- The rules force the cycle: event1 → event2 → event4 → event3 → event1 → ... so all four events will occur (and recur) in sequence.

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Because event1 has already happened initially, C1 (event1 or event4) is already true at the initial moment.
- Therefore C1 holds at some time (now), so ""eventually C1 holds"" is satisfied.
- Even if one required a future moment, the enforced cycle guarantees that event1 and event4 will continue to occur, so C1 will hold at (infinitely many) future times as well.

Final answer:
True
---
First identify the claim:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or Event4 happens.""
- C2 = ""Eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., at some time in the run, C1 is true).

Examine the context and constraints:
- Initially Event1 happened.
- The constraints force the sequence 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → … (a repeating cycle), because after each event the next is required, and Event1 already occurred to start the cycle.

Reasoning through time:
- At the initial moment Event1 has already happened, so C1 (Event1 or Event4) is already true right away.
- Even if “eventually” were interpreted to mean strictly after the initial moment, Event4 occurs later in the forced cycle, so C1 will become true then as well.
- In fact C1 holds infinitely often (whenever Event1 or Event4 occurs in the repeating cycle).

Conclusion:
- C2 (""eventually C1"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- The context says initially event3 happened, so event3 is true.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen; choose event1. That yields a sequence where both event3 and event1 happen (e.g. 3 → 1).
- That satisfies C1 (Event1 happens and Event3 happens), so C1 can be true.
- C2 asserts C1 does not hold; because C1 can hold, C2 is not true.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happened, so ""event3 happens"" is true.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. We can choose event1 next.
- If we choose event1, then both event3 (initial) and event1 (next) have happened, so C1 is satisfied.
- Since there is an allowed sequence in which C1 holds, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is not true. Hence C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: Event1 happens and Event3 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., it's not the case that both Event1 and Event3 happen).
We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed true from the given rules.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially Event3 happened (so Event3 is true).
- After Event3, either Event1 or Event2 must happen (choice).
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen.
- After Event2, Event4 must happen.
- After Event4, either Event1, Event2, or Event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- If after the initial Event3 we choose Event1, then both Event3 (initial) and Event1 occur, so C1 holds, and thus C2 is false in that scenario.
- Alternatively, after the initial Event3 we could choose Event2. Then Event4 must follow, and we can loop between Event2 and Event4 indefinitely (choosing Event2 after Event4), avoiding Event1; in that scenario C1 does not hold and C2 would be true.

Step 4 — Conclusion
Because there exist valid sequences where C1 holds and valid sequences where C1 does not hold, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. The statement ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore not entailed; it is not necessarily true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event3 happens, then event3 happens. (This is a formula of the form p → p.)
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds. We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- p → p is a logical tautology (always true for any proposition p). Thus C1 is true regardless of the events.
- C2 is the disjunction ""event2 happens OR C1 holds"". A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since C1 is always true, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether event2 actually happens.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: (event3 → event3).
- C2: event2 ∨ C1.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- The background rules about which events must follow which are irrelevant to the logical form of C1; they might constrain whether event2 or event3 actually occur, but they do not change the truth of the implication in C1.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 is a tautology: any proposition implies itself, so (event3 → event3) is always true.
- Therefore C2 = (event2 ∨ C1) = (event2 ∨ True) = True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Identify hypothesis: C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens.""
- Examine C1: ""If event3 happens then event3 happens"" is a tautology (p → p). It is always true regardless of whether event3 actually occurs.
- Therefore C1 holds.
- A disjunction with a true disjunct is true, so ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: If event2 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event4 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.

Step 3 — check C1
- From ""after event2: either event3 or event4"" and ""after event4: event3"", any occurrence of event2 is always followed (immediately or after event4) by event3. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — check C2
- C2 claims that if C1 holds then event4 happens. Starting from the initial event2 and using C1 we get event3. After event3, the rules allow either event1 or event4. Choosing event1 is allowed; after event1 choose event2, and this can loop (2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → …) indefinitely without ever taking the event4 branch. All choices respect the given rules and C1. Therefore event4 is not forced by C1.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2 happens.
- From event2, the rules say the next event must be event3 or event4.
- If event2 → event3 directly, done; if event2 → event4, then after event4 the rule forces event3. So in every possible continuation from event2, event3 will occur (possibly after event4). Therefore C1 (""If event2 happens, then event3 happens"") is true.
- C2 claims: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" But C1 holding does not force event4 to occur: there are valid continuations that never include event4 (e.g. event2 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 …), so event4 need not happen even though C1 is true.
- Hence C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C1: If event2 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event4 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules.

Step 2 — translate the rules (possible next events)
- Initially: event2 occurs.
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.

Step 3 — does C1 hold?
- From event2 we can go directly to event3, or to event4 and then (by the rule after event4) to event3. So in every possible continuation from event2, event3 will occur (immediately or next). Thus C1 is true.

Step 4 — does C1 imply event4 (is C2 true)?
- No: produce a valid execution that satisfies all rules and C1 but never triggers event4:
  event2 -> event3 -> event1 -> event2 -> event3 -> event1 -> ... 
  At each choice we pick the branch that avoids event4 (after event3 choose event1, after event1 choose event2). This infinite loop obeys all rules, and event3 always occurs after event2, so C1 holds, but event4 never happens.
- Therefore C1 being true does not force event4 to happen.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. What C2 asks: C2 says “C1 holds in the next state.” So we evaluate the formula C1 at the immediate successor of the initial state.

2. What the next state is: Initially event1 happened. The rule “after event1, event2 must happen” makes the next state one where event2 happens.

3. What C1 is at that state: C1 is “if event3 happens, then event4 happens” (a simple state-level implication). In the next state (where event2 happens), event3 does not happen, so the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true there.

4. Conclusion: C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

(As a side note: C1 is not true in all states generally — e.g. after event3 the system forces event1 rather than event4 — but that does not affect the truth of C2 which only asks about the immediate next state.)

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C1 says: ""If event3 happens, then event4 happens."" C2 says C1 holds in the next state (i.e., after the initial state).
- From the rules: initial -> event1, after event1 -> event2. So the ""next state"" is the state where event2 happens.
- From event2, either event3 or event4 must happen. Choose the branch event3.
- After event3, the rules require event1 (there is no requirement that event4 happens after event3). Thus there is a possible future where event3 occurs and event4 does not.
- That is a counterexample to C1, so C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 says: ""If event3 happens, then event4 happens."" (i.e. event3 -> event4 at a state)
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the state immediately after the initial one, event3 -> event4 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions / trace the next state
- Initially event1 happened (state0).
- By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", the next state (state1) must have event2.
- In state1 we therefore have event2 true, and event3 is not happening in that state (we have a single event per state in the given sequence).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state (state1)
- C1 evaluated in state1 is the proposition (event3 -> event4).
- In state1 event3 is false, so the implication event3 -> event4 is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether C2 follows from the given rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- From the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" any occurrence of event2 forces a subsequent occurrence of event1.
- If C1 holds (event2 always happens), then event2 occurs (indeed repeatedly). Each occurrence of event2 requires that event1 happen afterwards. Therefore event1 does happen.
- A consistent infinite sequence satisfying all rules under C1 is: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … (after event1 we choose event2, which is allowed).

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide if this implication follows from the given rules when C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about C1 => event1
- C1 says event2 always happens (i.e., event2 occurs).
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces that whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs afterwards.
- Therefore, if event2 always happens, event1 will necessarily occur (it must follow each occurrence of event2). A simple satisfying trace is the cycle ... → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ..., which meets all rules.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the event rules.

Step 2 — restate the rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — examine C1 and its consequences
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Whether or not event2 always holds, the rules include: after event2, event1 must happen.
- Since event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (at least once) after that initial event2.
- If event2 indeed always happens, that only adds more occurrences of event2, each of which likewise forces event1 after it. So event1 will occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is true (indeed event1 is forced by the rules already). Final answer: True."

The hypothesis asks whether ""Event3 does not happen"" (C1) is true in the next state (C2).

Given:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.""

Therefore the next state must be one of event1, event2, or event4 — none of which is event3. So in the next state event3 does not happen, so C1 holds there.

Answer: True

- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state, event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- The rule ""after event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen"" constrains the immediate next state after the initial event3 to be one of {event1, event2, event4}.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- Since the next state after event3 must be event1, event2, or event4, the next state cannot be event3.
- Therefore ""event3 does not happen"" is true in that next state.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 asks whether ""event2 or event1"" (C1) will eventually hold at some point.
- From the context: initially event4 happens.
- The rule ""After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen"" means the next event is either event2 or event3.
  - If the next event is event2, then C1 is immediately satisfied.
  - If the next event is event3, the rule ""After event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to happen afterward, so C1 becomes true then.
- In every possible allowed sequence starting from the initial event4, event2 occurs (possibly after an intermediate event3). Therefore C1 holds at some point, so C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is true.
---
Step 1 — understand the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""Eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., at some future point either Event2 or Event1 occurs).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules and initial condition.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial state:
- Initially Event4 happened.
- From Event4 the next must be either Event2 or Event3.
- From Event3, Event2 must happen (next).
- From Event2, the next is either Event1 or Event4 (not needed here).
- From Event1, Event3 must happen (not needed here).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state:
- If from Event4 we take the Event2 choice, Event2 happens immediately — then C1 holds.
- If from Event4 we take the Event3 choice, the rules force Event2 to happen next — so Event2 still happens, and thus C1 holds.

In every possible branch starting from the initial Event4, Event2 will occur (either immediately or after Event3). Therefore C1 becomes true at some future point in all executions.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the future either event2 or event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and the initial state:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- From event3, event2 must happen next.
- From event2, either event1 or event4 must happen next.
- From event1, event3 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace possible transitions from the initial event4:
- If event4 → event2, then event2 has happened immediately, so C1 holds.
- If event4 → event3, then by the rule after event3, event2 must happen next; so event2 will occur, and C1 holds.

In every possible branch from the initial event4, event2 occurs within at most two steps. Therefore C1 eventually holds on all executions.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 is ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction ""event2 or event2"" is just event2).
- From the rules, starting at event3 the next event can be event1, event2, or event4. So event2 can occur (e.g. 3 → 2 → 4 …).
- But event2 is not forced: one can avoid it by choosing 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 …, so there are allowed runs where event2 never happens.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e. event2 does not happen). Because there exists an allowed run where event2 does happen, C2 is not true in all models and is therefore false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Start: event3 happened.
- From 3 → one of {1, 2, 4} must happen next.
- 1 → 3.
- 2 → 4.
- 4 → one of {1, 2}.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- A sequence that includes event2: 3 → 2 (allowed). So event2 can happen.
- A sequence that never includes event2: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → … (always choose 1 after 3), so event2 can be avoided.

Conclusion
Because there are valid event sequences where event2 happens and valid ones where it does not, ""Event2 does not happen"" (C2) is not necessarily true. Therefore C2 is False.

- C1: If event3 happens, then event3 happens. (a tautology)
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So from the initial state, event2 does happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen; both options lead back to event2 eventually (event1 → event2, or event4 → event2), so event2 indeed occurs in the sequence.
- C1 is a tautology (P → P), so C1 holds regardless.

Step 3 — conclude about C2
- C2 is satisfied because event2 does happen (and also because C1 holds). Therefore C2 is true.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From ""initially event4 happened"" and ""after event4, event2 must happen"" we conclude event2 happens.
- Given event2 happens, the disjunction in C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is already satisfied regardless of C1.
- (Separately, C1 is itself true because it is a tautology.)

- After event4, event2 must happen. (So event2 follows from the initial event4.)
- The other rules (after event2 → either event1 or event4; after event1 → event2; after event3 → either event2 or event4) don’t contradict this.

Step 3 — trace the events
- From the initial event4, we can immediately deduce event2 happens.
- Therefore ""Event2 happens"" is true in the model.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since Event2 indeed happens, C2 is true (and C1 is also trivially true as a tautology).

- C1 = ""event2 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Logically C2 = (event2 ∧ event3) ∨ event2.

Step 2 — Simplify C2:
- (event2 ∧ event3) ∨ event2 is equivalent to event2 (since A ∨ (A ∧ B) ≡ A).

Step 3 — Use the context:
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" Therefore event2 does happen.

Conclusion:
- Since C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" and event2 did happen, C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asserts that C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") does not hold. We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — given conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state must have event1).
- (Other rules: after event1 → event3, after event3 → event1, after event4 → event1 or event3 — these don't override the after-event2 requirement for the next state.)

Step 3 — reasoning
- From the initial event2, the next state is forced to have event1.
- Therefore the next state cannot have event4 instead (we assume one event per state as customary here).
- So C1 is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event4 does NOT happen in the next state).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state must have event1).
- (Other rules: after event1 → event3, after event3 → event1, after event4 → either event1 or event3. These do not allow overriding the requirement from event2.)

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- Because event2 happened initially, the next state must be event1. Therefore event4 cannot be the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (event4 does not happen next), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True

We want to know whether C2 (""Event4 does not happen in the next state"") is true.

Step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The context says: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That forces the next state to be event1.
- If the next state must be event1, event4 cannot happen in that next state (events are taken as the next single event).
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

You are asking whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the rules.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Initial fact: event1 happened at the start.
- Rules:
  - After event4, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
  - After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
  - After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.

Trace from event2:
- If event2 happens, then either event3 or event4 happens next.
  - If event4 happens, the rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 will happen.
  - If event3 happens, the rule ""after event3, either event1 or event4 must happen"" gives two subcases:
    - If event3 → event1, then event1 happens directly.
    - If event3 → event4, then by the rule for event4, event1 will happen next.
- In every possible branch after event2, event1 occurs (event1 is forced to occur after event2).

Therefore, whenever event2 happens, event1 will (again) happen afterward, so C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify:  
C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state.""  
C2 = ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. if event1 occurs now, then event1 occurs in the next state.)

Step 2 — examine rules and trace from the initial state:  
- Initially event4 happened.  
- After event4, event2 must happen. So the next state after the initial one is event2 — therefore C1 is false (the next state after the initial state is event2, not event1).  
- From event2, event1 can happen afterward (event2 → event1 is allowed), so there are states in which event1 does occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:  
C2 asserts that whenever event1 happens, the next state will have event1 (i.e. event1 → next:event1). But the rules say after event1 the next state must be event2 or event3, never event1. So if event1 happens, the consequent C1 (that event1 happens next) is false. Since there are possible states where event1 does occur, the implication is not true in those states.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
We need to evaluate C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C2 claims: whenever event1 occurs, it is followed in the next state by event1.

From the rules:
- Initially event4.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, one of event1, event3, or event4 may happen.
- After event1, one of event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.

A counterexample run:
- Start: event4 (initial).
- Next: event2 (forced).
- Next: event1 (allowed after event2).
- Next: event2 (after event1, event2 is allowed).

Here event1 occurs, but the next state is event2, so C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false in that situation. Thus the implication C2 is not guaranteed and is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened. The rules say: after event4, event2 must happen. So the next state must be event2. Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 states: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event1 occurs now, then event1 occurs in the next state.
- But the rules say: after event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3 (not event1). So there are executions where event1 happens and the next state is not event1. That makes the implication false (there is a counterexample).
- Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Brief justification (concise, non-sensitive):
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened,"" so event1 is true.
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether C1 (that event3 eventually happens) holds.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., Event1 happened OR Event3 eventually happens).

Step 2 — Use the given facts:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""Event1 happens"" is already true.

Step 3 — Evaluate the disjunction:
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since ""Event1 happens"" is true, C2 is true regardless of whether C1 (Event3 eventually happens) holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" (where C1 is ""Event3 eventually happens""). We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true.)
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event2, one of event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3 or after event4, no further events occur.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Possible sequences consistent with the context include:
  - event1 → event3 (stops)
  - event1 → event4 (stops)
  - event1 → event2 → event3 (stops)
  - event1 → event2 → event4 (stops)
- Thus C1 (event3 eventually happens) is not guaranteed (some sequences end with event4 and never have event3).
- However, event1 is explicitly given as having happened initially.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction: ""event1 happens OR event3 eventually happens.""
- Since event1 did happen (given), the disjunction is true regardless of whether event3 occurs.

True"

Sample responses:
C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds OR event1 happens"", where C1 is ""event1 does not happen"". So C2 is (not event1) OR (event1), which is true in every possible case.

Stepwise:
- Initially event3 happened. From event3 the next must be either event1 or event4.
- If event1 ever happens, the right disjunct of C2 is true.
- If event1 never happens, then C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is true, so the left disjunct of C2 is true.

In all possible timelines C2 is true. 

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (¬E1).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = (¬E1) ∨ E1.

Step 2 — logical evaluation:
(¬E1) ∨ E1 is the law of excluded middle — it is true regardless of any additional constraints about event sequences.

Conclusion: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- Let P = ""Event1 happens"".
- C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"" = ¬P.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = (¬P) ∨ P.

Step 2 — Examine C2:
- (¬P) ∨ P is a logical tautology (law of excluded middle): for any truth value of P, either P or ¬P is true.

Step 3 — Relevance of the context:
- The given event-sequence rules and the initial event3 do not affect the tautological status of C2.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and Event4 does not happen"" (i.e., event3 ∧ ¬event4).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (choice).
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen, and after event1 no other events can happen (terminal).
- If event4 happens, then event2 must happen, which then forces event1, and then termination.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Sequence A: 3 → 2 → 1. Here event4 does not happen, so C2 holds.
- Sequence B: 3 → 4 → 2 → 1. Here event4 does happen, so C2 does not hold.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because both sequences are permitted by the rules, C2 is not guaranteed; it can be true in some executions and false in others. Therefore C2 is not entailed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (Event3 happens) AND (Event4 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. So ""Event3 happens"" is true.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (one of them must occur).
- If event2 happens then event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.
- If event4 happens then event2 must happen (and then event1 must happen, and then nothing else).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Sequence A (choose event2 after event3): event3 → event2 → event1 → stop. Here event4 does not happen, so C1 holds and C2 is true in this run.
- Sequence B (choose event4 after event3): event3 → event4 → event2 → event1 → stop. Here event4 does happen, so C1 is false and C2 is false in this run.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because there are allowed sequences where event4 does happen, C1 is not guaranteed. C2 is not entailed by the premises (it can be true in some sequences but is not necessarily true in all). Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and Event4 does not happen"" (i.e., Event3 ∧ ¬Event4).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:

- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (exclusive? not stated, but at least one of them must occur next).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event4, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences starting from event3:
- Option A: After event3 → event2 → event1. This satisfies all constraints and in this run event4 does not happen, so C2 holds in this branch.
- Option B: After event3 → event4 → event2 → event1. This also satisfies all constraints, but here event4 does happen, so C1 (¬Event4) is false and thus C2 is false in this branch.

Step 4 — conclusion about truth of C2:
- Because there is at least one allowed continuation where event4 does happen, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. The hypothesis is not entailed (it is only possible in some branches, not in all).

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 happens or event1 happens.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen (at least at the start).
- The other lines constrain what can happen after events, but they do not negate the fact that event1 already happened.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is ""event3 or event1 happens."" Because event1 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since event1 happened and C1 is true, C2 is true.

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (Event3 happens) OR (Event1 happens).
- C2 = (Event1 happens) AND C1.

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- Initially, Event1 happened — so ""Event1 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because Event1 happened (so the OR condition is satisfied).
- C2 is true because both parts hold: Event1 happens (given) and C1 holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""

Step 2 — facts from context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- C1 is a disjunction (event3 or event1). Since event1 is true, C1 is true regardless of event3.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires event1 to be true (it is) and C1 to hold (it does). Therefore C2 is true.

True"

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event4 happens or C1 holds.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions and initial fact:
- Initially, event2 happened. So C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is already satisfied.
- Also, the rule ""After event2, event4 must happen"" implies that because event2 happened, event4 will happen.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- C2 is ""event4 happens or C1 holds"". We already have C1 true (and in fact event4 happens too), so C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First identify the claims:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event4 happens or C1 holds.

From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 has already occurred, so C1 is true (event2 eventually happens — already did).

Since C1 is true, the disjunction in C2 (""Event4 happens or C1 holds"") is true regardless of whether Event4 occurs. (As a side note, the rules also force Event4 to occur after the initial Event2, but that isn't needed to decide C2.)

Final answer: True
---
What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event4 happens or C1 holds.""
We must decide whether C2 is true given the initial facts and rules.

Examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 has happened (given).
- Rule A: After event2, event4 must happen.
- Rule B: After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- Rule C: After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- Rule D: After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Trace the sequence and consequences
1. Since event2 has already happened initially, C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true immediately.
2. From Rule A, because event2 happened, event4 must happen next. So event4 will occur.
3. Therefore C2 (""event4 happens or C1 holds"") is true regardless: C1 already holds, and event4 will happen as well.

Conclusion
C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. whenever event3 occurs, event1 must occur in the next state)

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen. (so event1 is possible but not forced)
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample
- Start: initially event1.
- By the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"", the next event is event3.
- From event3 we may choose event4 (allowed by ""after event3, either event1 or event4 must happen"").
- If we choose event4 next, then event1 does not happen in that next state, so C1 is false in that case.
- Thus the implication ""if event3 happens then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed.

Conclusion
C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the constraints.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C2 asserts: whenever event3 occurs, event1 will occur in the following state.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. (So from the initial state the next state has event3.)
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen. (So when event3 occurs, the next state may be event1 OR may be event4.)
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- (Also: after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen — not needed here.)

Step 3 — produce a counterexample
- From the initial event1, the next state must be event3 (by the rule after event1).
- When event3 happens, the rules allow the next state to be event4 instead of event1.
- If the next state is event4, then C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false for that occurrence of event3.
- Therefore C2 (that event3 implies C1) is not guaranteed by the rules.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Let's reason step by step.

- ""After X, Y must happen"" means: if event X occurs at some state, then in the next state one of the listed events must occur.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. whenever event3 occurs, event1 must occur in the next state.

From the premises: ""After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen."" That allows the next state after event3 to be event4 instead of event1. So C2 would require event1 always follows event3, but the premises permit an alternative (event4).

Counterexample trace:
- state0: event1 (given initially).
- state1: event3 (required after event1).
- state2: event4 (allowed after event3).

At state1 event3 happens, but state2 is event4, so event1 does not happen in the next state — C1 fails in that case. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- The rules are temporal: ""After X, ... must happen"" — so the hypothesis C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is claiming that event2 must occur following event1.
- From the rules: after event1 either event2 or event4 must happen. So event2 is not guaranteed; event4 can occur instead.
- Starting from the initial event2, one possible continuation is: event1 (allowed after the initial event2), then event4 (choose the event4 option after event1), then event3 (choose event3 after event4), then event4 (forced after event3), and repeat event3↔event4 forever. In this run, event1 occurs but event2 never occurs afterward.
- Thus C1 is not guaranteed, so C1 is false. C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is equivalent to C1 here, so C2 is also false.
---

---
Step 1 — what C2 says
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- Logically, C2 is equivalent to C1 (p -> (p -> q) is equivalent to p -> q), so it suffices to test C1: does event1 necessarily lead to event2?

Step 2 — examine the rules
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen (so event2 is not guaranteed immediately).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen (so 3 and 4 can cycle).
- Initially event2 happened (so event1 can be reached afterwards via event2 -> event1).

Step 3 — counterexample trace showing C1 can fail
Construct a possible sequence allowed by the rules:
- Initially: event2 (given).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event4 (allowed instead of event2).
- From event4 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 must go to event4, and from event4 choose event3 again, etc.

In this trace, event1 occurred but no event2 occurs afterward (the system can loop between event3 and event4 forever). So ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed.

Conclusion
- C1 is not necessarily true, and therefore C2 (equivalent to C1) is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is (C1) OR (event2). C1 is ""event1 does not happen"".
- For C2 to be false both disjuncts must be false: event1 must occur and event2 must not occur.
- From the context: initially event3 happened. After event3, event1 or event4 may happen.
- Choose event1 next, and then choose event4 (after event1, event4 is allowed). Sequence: event3 -> event1 -> event4.
- This sequence contains event1 and contains no event2, so C1 is false and event2 is false, making C2 false.

Thus C2 is not necessarily true; it can be false. Final: False.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens (i.e., ""Event1 does not happen OR Event2 happens"").

We ask whether C2 must be true given the context.

From the context:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event4, no events can happen.

Construct a valid sequence that falsifies C2: choose event1 after the initial event3, then choose event3, then choose event4 to end:
- event3 (initial) -> event1 -> event3 -> event4 (end)

In this sequence:
- Event1 does happen, so C1 is false.
- Event2 never happens.

Thus C2 = (C1 or event2) is false in this sequence. Because a valid execution exists that makes C2 false, C2 is not guaranteed true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. From event3 the next event must be event1 or event4.
- If we choose event4 next, the sequence ends; event1 does not occur (C1 true), so C2 = (C1 or event2) is true in that branch.
- But if we choose event1 next, then event1 does occur (C1 false). After event1 we may choose event3, and from event3 again choose event1, and so on—so there is a valid infinite sequence alternating event1 and event3 where event2 never occurs.
- In that sequence C1 is false and event2 does not happen, so C2 is false there.
- Because there exists an allowed sequence that makes C2 false, C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore the correct answer is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- The rules require that after event1, event4 must happen, and that after event4 no further events can occur. They do not forbid other events occurring between event1 and the eventual event4.
- There is also a rule that after event3, event4 must happen; this is compatible with event3 occurring before event4.
- Therefore a valid sequence is: event1 (initial) → event3 → event4 → stop. This sequence satisfies all constraints:
  - event4 does occur after event1,
  - after event3 event4 occurs,
  - and after event4 nothing else happens.
- Because such a sequence exists in which event3 happens, the claim C1 (""event3 does not happen"") does not always hold. Thus C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- C2 asserts that ""event3 does not happen"" in every possible execution.
- The rules allow a run: event1 (initial) → event3 → event4 → stop.
  - After event1, event4 does happen later (rule satisfied).
  - After event3, event4 must happen (rule satisfied).
  - After event4 no further events occur (rule satisfied).
- This run includes event3, so ""event3 does not happen"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 says C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") always holds — i.e., event3 can never occur in any permitted sequence.

Step 2 — restate the rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen (event4 must occur sometime after event1).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (only relevant if event2 occurs).
- After event3, event4 must happen (if event3 occurs, event4 must occur afterwards).

Step 3 — check if event3 can occur without violating rules:
- Start: event1 has happened.
- A possible valid sequence is: event1 → event3 → event4.
  - After event1, event4 does happen (after event3), satisfying that rule.
  - After event3, event4 happens, satisfying that rule.
  - After event4 no further events occur, satisfying the terminal rule.
  - The rule about event2 is irrelevant here.
- This sequence shows event3 can occur while all constraints remain satisfied.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is not guaranteed, because a valid sequence exists where event3 does happen.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event1 either event2 or event3 must happen. Choose event3.
- After event3, event1 must happen, so sequence is event1 → event3 → event1.
- After that event1 can be followed by event2, and after event2 event4 may occur.
- Sequence: event1, event3, event1, event2, event4 is valid and contains both event3 and event4, so C1 can hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event1 happened.
- After event1 you may choose event3. So sequence: 1, 3.
- After event3, event1 must happen. Now: 1, 3, 1.
- After that event1 you can choose event2. Now: 1, 3, 1, 2.
- After event2 you may choose event4. Now: 1, 3, 1, 2, 4. After event4 nothing else happens.

This valid sequence contains both event3 and event4, so C1 can hold. C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 can be true, C2 is not true. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C2 is the negation of C1. C1 = ""Event3 happens and Event4 happens."" So C2 = ""It is not the case that both Event3 and Event4 happen.""

Step 2 — check the rules and whether both events can occur:
- Start: event1 happened.
- From event1 the next is either event2 or event3.
- From event2 the next can be event1, event3, or event4.
- From event3 the next must be event1.
- After event4 nothing else can happen.

Step 3 — exhibit a valid sequence that makes C1 true:
- One valid sequence is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4.
  - 1 (initial)
  - 1 -> 2 (allowed)
  - 2 -> 3 (allowed)
  - 3 -> 1 (required)
  - 1 -> 2 (allowed)
  - 2 -> 4 (allowed)
  - 4 ends the sequence.
- This sequence includes both event3 and event4, so C1 can hold.

Conclusion:
- Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the context where both Event3 and Event4 happen, C1 can be true. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: Event4 happens or C1 holds.

We ask whether C2 must be true given the context.

Examine the rules and trace a possible sequence:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3 we may choose event1 (the rules say after event3 either event1 or event4 must happen).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2 we may choose event1 (the rules say after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen).

So there is a valid infinite sequence: 3 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ...
In this sequence:
- Event4 never happens.
- Event1 does happen, but it is never followed (ever) by event3, so C1 is false in this sequence.

Thus we have a model consistent with the context where neither event4 happens nor C1 holds. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — understand the claim
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens"" (i.e. every occurrence of event1 is followed eventually by event3).
- C2: ""event4 happens or C1 holds"" (a disjunction: either event4 occurs somewhere, or the implication in C1 is true for all occurrences).

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the next step must be either event1 or event4.
- From event1 the next step must be event2.
- From event2 the next step must be either event1 or event3.
- So choices are nondeterministic at the indicated points.

Step 3 — exhibit a counterexample run that falsifies C2
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose from event3 → event1.
- From event1 → event2 (forced).
- From event2 choose → event1.
- Repeat the cycle: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... indefinitely.

In this run:
- event4 never happens (we always avoid taking the branch to event3 from event2 and avoid the branch to event4 from event3).
- event1 does happen, but in this run no event3 ever occurs after those event1 occurrences, so C1 is false.

Thus both disjuncts of C2 are false in this possible evolution, so C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: Event4 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- We are told ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 is true somewhere in the run (at the start).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- C1 says: whenever event1 happens, event3 happens. Since event3 already happened initially, the consequent (event3 happens) is already true in the run. Therefore the implication C1 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""event4 happens or C1 holds."" We have just shown C1 holds, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means there are no further events after that initial event2 — there is no transition that produces another event.
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event4 happens"". C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., that in the state after the initial one, event2 or event4 happens).
- Because no events can occur after event2, in the next state neither event2 nor event4 happens.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 (event2 or event4) is true in the initial state.
- But the rules say: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means there is no next event/state after the initial state.
- Since there is no next state in which either event2 or event4 occurs, C1 does not hold in the next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret: C1 is the proposition ""event2 happens or event4 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 is true in the next state.

Step 2 — use the rules: Initially event2 happened. The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means that from the initial state there are no events in the next state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state: since neither event2 nor event4 can occur after event2, C1 is false in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds. So C2 is true iff Event3 happens OR Event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- Rule: After event4, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace events:
- From the initial event4, event3 must happen (directly by the rule). Therefore Event3 happens.

Step 4 — conclude:
- Since Event3 happens, C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds. (Equivalently: Event3 happens OR Event2 does not happen.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen. So event3 will occur (at least once) because event4 occurred initially.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event3 follows.)
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen. (But that does not prevent event3 from having occurred.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (Irrelevant here unless event1 occurs.)

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- From the initial event4, event3 must happen. Therefore Event3 happens is guaranteed.
- Because Event3 happens, the disjunction in C2 (""Event3 happens or Event2 does not happen"") is already satisfied regardless of whether Event2 later occurs.
- Even if Event2 were to occur later, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" would ensure event3 anyway. So C2 is satisfied in all possible cases.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds (i.e., Event3 happens OR Event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen. (So event3 will occur.)
- Other rules (after event3 → either event2 or event4; after event2 → event3; after event1 → either event2 or event3) only affect later possibilities but do not prevent event3 already required after event4.

Step 3 — conclude:
- From the initial event4 and the rule ""after event4, event3 must happen,"" event3 does happen.
- Therefore the disjunction ""Event3 happens OR Event2 does not happen"" is true (because Event3 happens).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — restate the given rules:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (repeated)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Start: event3 (given).
- From event3 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we must go to event2.
- From event2 we must go to event1.
- This creates an infinite loop ... -> event1 -> event2 -> event1 -> event2 -> ... with no rule forcing event3 to occur again.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 (""event3 always happens"") would require event3 to occur at every (or arbitrarily many/future) points in every allowed sequence. The rules do not force event3 to occur after the initial occurrence, and there exists a valid infinite trace where event3 does not recur.
- Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (we must decide whether C2 is True or False)

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (duplicate rule repeated)

Step 3 — reason about possible traces
- From the initial event3 we are forced to have either event1 or event4 next.
- Both choices lead to event2, and event2 forces event1, and event1 forces event2, so the trace thereafter will cycle between event1 and event2 (or follow that required sequence).
- Nothing in the rules requires event3 to occur again after the initial occurrence. There is no rule that forces event3 to always recur or hold at every point.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 always happens"") does not hold.
- So C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false.

Interpretation of C1: ""Event3 always happens."" The context explicitly says ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means in every allowed execution/trace, event3 has occurred (it is given as an initial event).

Examine the constraints and possible continuations:
- Start: event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- If event1 happens → event2 must happen → event1 must happen → event2 must happen … (an event1/event2 cycle).
- If event4 happens → event2 must happen → event1 must happen → event2 … (again leads into the event1/event2 cycle).
In every possible continuation event3 has already occurred (it was initial); nothing in the rules removes or contradicts that.

Therefore C1 is true (event3 does happen), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event4 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""Event4 happens"".
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. event1 → event4.

Now use the transition rules (with initial event2):
- Initially: 2.
- After 2 must come 3, so sequence begins 2 → 3.
- After 3 can come 1 or 2. If we choose 1, we get 2 → 3 → 1.
- After 1 can come 2, 3, or 4. If we choose 2, we get 2 → 3 → 1 → 2.
- From that 2 we must go to 3 again, then we can choose 1 again, producing the cycle 1 → 2 → 3 → 1.

This yields a valid infinite behavior where event1 occurs (e.g. at 2 → 3 → 1) but event4 never occurs (we repeatedly choose the transitions 1→2, 2→3, 3→1). Thus event1 can happen without event4 happening, so the implication event1 → event4 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event4 happens or event4 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event4 happens"".
- C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"", i.e. ""If event1 happens then event4 happens"" (event1 → event4).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2.
- After event2 → event3 (forced).
- After event3 → either event1 or event2.
- After event1 → either event2, event3, or event4.
- After event4 → event2.

Step 3 — find a counterexample trace
Start: event2 → event3 → choose event1. After event1, choose event2 (not event4). Then event2 → event3 → choose event1 again, and repeat. This produces traces where event1 does occur, yet event4 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence where event1 happens but event4 never happens, C2 (event1 → event4) does not follow from the context.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 is equivalent to ""Event4 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same literal).
- C2 claims: if Event1 happens, then Event4 happens.
- From the rules:
  - Initially Event2 happens.
  - After Event2 → Event3 must happen.
  - After Event3 → either Event1 or Event2.
  - After Event1 → either Event2, Event3, or Event4.
  - After Event4 → Event2.
- A counterexample sequence that satisfies all constraints but has Event1 occur without Event4 ever happening:
  initial: Event2 → Event3 → Event1 → Event2 → Event3 → Event1 → ... (repeat).
  This obeys all ""after"" rules and contains Event1 but never Event4.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens.
- From event1, event3 must happen.
- From event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen next.
- If from event3 we choose event1, the same obligations repeat (event1 → event3 → event1 → ...). This infinite cycle satisfies all rules without ever producing event2 or event4.
- Thus it is possible that neither event2 nor event4 happens, but it is also possible that one of them happens in other valid sequences. C1 (event4 or event2) is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not necessarily true; it cannot be asserted as true — so the correct answer is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens. After event1, event3 must happen, so event3 occurs.
- After event3, one of event1, event2, or event4 must happen. It is allowed that event1 happens again.
- If we always choose event1 after event3, the sequence cycles event1 → event3 → event1 → ... and neither event2 nor event4 ever needs to occur.
- Therefore ""event4 or event2 happens"" (C1) is not necessarily true, and its negation C2 is not entailed by the premises. Hence C2 is False.
---
False.

Reasoning: Initially E1 happens, so by ""after E1, event3 must happen"" we get E3. After E3 one of {E1, E2, E4} must occur. It is consistent to choose E1 repeatedly, producing the cycle E1 → E3 → E1 → E3 … and never having E2 or E4. Thus C1 (E4 or E2) is not forced, but it is also not ruled out (one could instead pick E2 or E4 after some E3). Therefore C2 (neither E2 nor E4 happens) is not entailed by the premises, so the statement ""C2 is True"" is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens"" (i.e., (not Event4) OR Event4).

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- The context states: ""Initially, event4 happened."" So event4 does happen (at least initially).
- Other transition rules are irrelevant to the truth of C2 because C2 only references whether event4 happens or not.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2:
- Given the context, C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is the disjunction (C1) OR (event4 happens). Since event4 does happen, the second disjunct is true, so the whole disjunction C2 is true.
- (Note also that logically (not P) or P is a tautology, so C2 would be true in any case.)

True

- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" (i.e., (not Event4) OR Event4)

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event4 does not happen OR Event4 happens.""
- Since ""Event4 happens"" is true (from the initial event4), the disjunction is true regardless of C1.

Final answer:
True

- We must evaluate C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" C1 is ""Event4 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The context states that initially event4 happened. So event4 does happen (at least once).
- Therefore C1 (""event4 does not happen"") is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is (not event4) OR (event4). Since event4 does happen, the disjunction is true.
- (Independently, (not E4) ∨ E4 is a tautology, so it is always true.)

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is true.

1) Understand conditions:
- Start: event4 happens.
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: event4 must happen.
- After event3: no further events.

2) C1 says: whenever event4 happens, event1 happens (so event4→event1; event3 after event4 is forbidden if C1 holds).
3) Assume C1 holds. From the initial event4, event1 must follow. After that, the rule allows either event2 or event4. Choose event4. By C1 that event4 must be followed by event1 again. This yields an infinite alternation event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... in which event2 never occurs.

Since under C1 there is a valid sequence where event2 never happens, C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is not guaranteed. Therefore the correct answer is:

False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happens.
- Assume C1 holds: whenever event4 happens it is followed by event1. That rules out the event4→event3 option.
- From event1 the rules allow either event2 or event4 next.
- A valid run that respects the rules and C1 is: event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... forever (always choose event4 after event1). This run never produces event2.
- Since there exists a permitted execution with C1 in which event2 does not occur, C1 does not imply event2. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- C1 says: whenever event4 happens it is followed by event1. Starting from the initial event4, C1 forces event1.
- After event1 the rules allow either event2 or event4. Under C1 you may choose event4 (which by C1 leads back to event1).
- This yields an infinite loop event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... that never produces event2.
- Because there is at least one valid sequence (model) where C1 holds but event2 never happens, C1 does not imply event2. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: C1 simplifies to ""event3 happens."" The context does not force event3 — for example, the sequence event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 ... is allowed and never includes event3. But other allowed sequences do include event3. So C1 is not guaranteed, and its negation C2 is not entailed either. Therefore C2 is not true.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 simplifies to ""Event3 happens"" (event3 or event3 is just event3).
- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- It is possible to choose event2 after event1, and then choose event1 after event2 (since after event2 one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen). This yields an allowed cycle event1 → event2 → event1 → ... that never produces event3.
- Because there exists an allowed execution that avoids event3, C1 is not guaranteed. But C1 could also occur in other allowed executions (e.g., choose event3 after event1).
- Therefore the statement ""C1 does not hold"" is not universally true given the context. Hence C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which is equivalent to simply ""Event3 happens"".
- From the context we only know: start at event1, and possible next events are given by the non-deterministic rules 1->{2,3,4}, 2->{1,3,4}, 3->{4}, 4->{2,3}.
- Event3 can occur (for example 1 -> 3 -> 4 ...). So C1 is possible.
- But event3 is not forced: there is a valid infinite trace avoiding event3, e.g. 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... never visits event3. Thus C1 is not entailed.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. event3 does not happen). That is also not entailed by the context (event3 may happen in some traces). Therefore C2 is not true.

So C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (a property of a given state: its immediate successor has event4)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists some future state where C1 is true)

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen → in s1 event3.
- After event3, event4 must happen → in s2 event4.
- After event4, no other events can happen (s2 is terminal).
- (After event1 no other events can happen — irrelevant since event1 never occurs.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- s0: event2.
- s1: event3 (required after s0).
- s2: event4 (required after s1).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- At s0, C1 is false (next state s1 has event3, not event4).
- At s1, C1 is true because the next state s2 has event4.
- Therefore there exists a future state (s1) where C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future state, C1 is true (there is a state whose immediate successor has event4).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 has occurred.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so the next step after the initial one will be event3).
- After event3, event4 must happen (so the step after the one with event3 will be event4).
- After event4, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Time 0: event2 has happened (initial).
- Time 1 (next state): event3 happens (by the rule after event2).
- Time 2 (next next state): event4 happens (by the rule after event3).

At time 1, the ""next state"" (time 2) has event4, so C1 is true at time 1. Therefore there exists a future state (time 1) at which C1 holds.

Conclusion:
C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (C1 is a property that can be true at some particular state.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (There exists a future state at which C1 is true.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace states
- Initially (state0) event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event3 must happen."" So in state1 event3 occurs.
- ""After event3, event4 must happen."" So in state2 event4 occurs.
- After event4 no further events happen; event1 never occurs in this trace.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- At state0, the next state (state1) has event3, not event4, so C1 is false at state0.
- At state1, the next state (state2) has event4, so C1 is true at state1.
- Therefore there is a future state (state1) where C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is equivalent to just ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 says: if event3 happens, then event2 happens.
- From the rules: start with event4. After 4 you may choose 3 (4 → 3). After 3 you may choose 1 (3 → 1). After 1 you may choose 4 (1 → 4). After 4 you may choose 3 again, and so on.
- This yields a valid infinite trace 4, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, ... in which event3 occurs but event2 never occurs.
- Since there is a consistent sequence where event3 happens and event2 does not, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.

- The rules give transitions: 4 -> {2,3}, 3 -> {1,4}, 1 -> {2,4}, 2 -> {1,4}, and initially event4 happened.
- There is a possible sequence that contains event3 but never contains event2: choose 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... (the cycle 4-3-1 repeats indefinitely and avoids event2).
- Thus event3 can occur without event2 ever happening, so ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" means: whenever event3 occurs, event2 occurs (somewhere).

Step 2 — examine the rules and find a counterexample if possible:
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4 you may choose event3 (since 4 -> 2 or 3).
- From event3 you may choose event1 (since 3 -> 1 or 4).
- From event1 you may choose event4 (since 1 -> 2 or 4).
This yields the repeating sequence: 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... which never includes event2 but does include event3.

Step 3 — conclude:
Because there is a valid sequence where event3 happens and event2 never happens, the implication ""if event3 happens then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
First identify and simplify the hypothesis:

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to just ""Event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" therefore simplifies to ""Event2 happens or Event2 happens"", i.e. again ""Event2 happens"".

From the context, the initial event that happened is event2, so ""Event2 happens"" is true. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" (which is just Event2 happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" (so C2 is ""Event2 or Event2"", i.e. Event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So Event2 does happen.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since Event2 happens, C2 (which is equivalent to Event2) is true.

Final answer: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify question:
- C1 says: ""Event4 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 says: ""C1 does not hold.""
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions and trace:
- Initially, event4 happened. So event4 occurs (satisfies the first part of C1).
- After event4, one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen. So it is allowable for event1 to happen next.
- Therefore there exists a valid sequence (for example: event4 → event1) in which both event4 and event1 occur, so C1 can hold.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Since C1 can hold, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened, so event4 is true.
- The rule ""After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen"" allows event1 to happen next.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence where event4 happens and then event1 happens, so C1 can hold.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 is possible, C2 is not true.
---
False

Reasoning:
- The context states event4 happens initially.
- After event4, event1 is one of the allowed next events, so a valid sequence is event4 → event1.
- Therefore C1 (event4 happens and event1 happens) can hold.
- Since C1 can be true, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true."

Sample responses:
The hypothesis C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event4 happens and event2 happens.""

Step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event4 must happen → event4 occurs.
- After event4, event1 must happen → event1 occurs.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. If we choose event2, then event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen (and the process continues).

Thus there exists a valid sequence (event3 → event4 → event1 → event2 → ...) in which both event4 and event2 occur, so C1 can hold. Because C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, and C1 can indeed hold, C2 is not true.

Answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens, so event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After that event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. We can choose event2.
- Choosing event2 makes event2 happen; after event2, event1 must happen again (cycles are allowed).
- Thus there is a valid sequence where both event4 and event2 happen, so C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
---
You ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happens.
- From event3, event4 must happen → event4 occurs.
- From event4, event1 must happen → event1 occurs.
- From event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. Choose event2 → event2 occurs.
- From event2, event1 must happen (and the sequence can continue).

This trace (3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 1 ...) satisfies all constraints and makes both event4 and event2 happen, so C1 holds in at least one valid execution. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine given facts:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- C1 is: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens.""

Step 3 — reason:
- If we assume C1 holds (i.e., event3 → event1) and we already have event3 (given), then by modus ponens we can deduce event1.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds (i.e. if event3 → event1), then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- Other rules allow cycles (event2 → event3, event1 → (event2 or event4), event4 → event1).

Step 3 — check C1:
- C1 (event3 → event1) is not entailed by the context, because from event3 the system could choose event2 and loop (so event1 is not guaranteed). So C1 is false/not guaranteed.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a conditional: assume C1 holds. Given that assumption and the fact that event3 did happen initially, by modus ponens we get event1. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" follows from the context. So C2 is entailed (true).

Answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Identify given facts: initially event3 happened.
- C1 states: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a universal claim; it may be false relative to the given rules (because after event3 one could instead have event2), but we treat it as a hypothetical antecedent in C2.
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" That is, assuming the antecedent C1 is true, does event1 follow?
- Since event3 actually happened initially, and C1 says event3 implies event1, from C1 plus the initial event3 we can conclude event1 happens.
- Therefore the conditional C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""Event3 happens or event3 happens,"" which is equivalent to simply ""Event3 happens.""
- C2 asserts the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event3 does not happen.""
- From the context: initially event2 happens, and after event2 either event1, event3, or event4 must happen. So it is allowed for event3 to happen next.
- Example valid sequence: event2 → event3 → event1 (after event3, event1 is allowed; after event1 no further events). This sequence includes event3, so C1 holds in that execution.
- Since there exists a valid sequence where event3 happens, C2 (""event3 does not happen"") is not true in general.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which is equivalent to simply ""Event3 happens"".
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""Event3 does not happen"".
3. From the context: the sequence starts with event2, and after event2 either event1, event3, or event4 must happen. So event3 is a possible (allowed) next event.
4. Because event3 can occur (for example: event2 → event3 → event1), we cannot conclude that ""Event3 does not happen"" is true in all cases.
5. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""Event3 happens"".
- C2 is the negation of C1, i.e. ""Event3 does not happen"".
- From the context: after the initial event2, one allowed choice is event1; after event1 no further events occur. So the sequence event2 → event1 is allowed and in that sequence event3 does not happen (so C2 would be true in that particular run).
- However, event3 is also a permitted choice after event2, so there are allowed sequences where event3 does happen. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the premises (it is not true in all possible sequences).

Since C2 is not necessarily entailed by the given conditions, the correct answer is False."

Votes: {'True': 1, 'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 has occurred, so ""event3 happens"" is already satisfied.
- But C2 also requires C1: ""event4 eventually happens"".
- From event3 the next event can be either event1 or event4. If we always choose event1 instead of event4, and after event1 always choose event3, we get the infinite sequence: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... which never produces event4.
- Because there is a valid behavior that never reaches event4, event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen, so C1 need not hold. Therefore C2 (C1 and event3) is not necessarily true.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""event4 eventually happens, and event3 happens"") is forced by the given rules starting from the initial event3.

Examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.

To show C2 is true you would need event4 to inevitably occur at some future point (C1) and event3 to occur (it already has initially). To show C2 is false it suffices to exhibit a valid infinite sequence (consistent with the rules) in which event4 never occurs.

Counterexample sequence (valid choices at each step):
- Start at event3 (given).
- Choose event1 (allowed after 3).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed after 1).
- From that event3 again choose event1, then event3, etc.

This yields the infinite trace: 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, ... which never includes event4 but always respects the rules. Thus event4 need not eventually happen (C1 is not guaranteed), so C2 (which requires C1) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""Event4 eventually happens"" AND ""event3 happens"") follows from the scenario.

1) Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event3 happens.

2) Initial condition and rules:
- Initially event3 happened (so ""event3 happens"" is already true).
- Transitions: 1 -> {2,3}; 2 -> {1,4}; 3 -> {1,4}; 4 -> {1,2}.

3) Can event4 be avoided forever?
Yes. From the initial 3, choose the non-4 option each time:
- 3 -> 1 (choose 1 instead of 4)
- 1 -> 2 (choose 2 instead of 3)
- 2 -> 1 (choose 1 instead of 4)
and repeat 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 ... forever. This infinite trace never reaches event4.

Therefore event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen (C1 does not hold in all possible executions). Although event3 did happen initially, the conjunction C2 requires event4 to eventually happen as well; since it need not, C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in all possible evolutions, event3 never happens).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace possibilities:
- From the initial event4, if the next event is event3, then event3 occurs (C1 violated).
- If instead the next event is event2, the rule “after event2, event3 must happen” forces event3 to occur afterward (C1 violated again).

Thus in every allowed continuation, event3 occurs. C1 is false, so C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all possible event sequences following the rules, Event3 never happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (this choice appears twice but is the same requirement).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- (Other rules about what follows event3 or event1 are irrelevant once we know whether event3 can be avoided.)

Step 3 — trace possibilities from the initial state
- From the initial event4, there are two possibilities:
  1. event3 happens next → C1 is immediately false.
  2. event2 happens next → but after event2, event3 must happen → C1 is false.

In both possible continuations from the initial event4, event3 inevitably occurs.

Conclusion
- C1 cannot hold in any allowed execution, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in all possible event sequences, Event3 never happens).

Examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
(Other rules: after event3 → event1 or event4; after event1 → event2 or event3 or event4 — not needed for this conclusion.)

Trace possible next steps from the initial event4:
- If after event4 we pick event3, then event3 has happened (contradicts C1).
- If after event4 we pick event2, then by the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" we get event3 next (so event3 still happens, contradicting C1).

Thus in every allowed continuation from the initial event4, event3 inevitably occurs (at latest on the second step). Therefore C1 is false, and C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

False"

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- The context gives transition rules based on the last event. Initially event2 happened.
- From ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen,"" the immediate next state (after the initial state) can only have event1 or event3 — not both.
- To get event4 you must first have event3 and then (in the following step) choose event4 (""After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen""), so event4 cannot occur in the same next state that follows the initial event2.
- Therefore the next state cannot simultaneously have event3 and event4, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""event3 happens and event4 happens"" (both in the same state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediately next state both event3 and event4 occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (so the next state is either event1 or event3, not both).
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen — but that applies after a state where event3 happened (i.e., in the state following the one with event3).
- After event4, event1 must happen (irrelevant here).
- Duplicate rules don't change anything.

Step 3 — reason about possible next states
- From the initial event2, the next state can be event1 or event3.
- To satisfy C1 in the next state we would need both event3 and event4 in that same next state. The rules never allow two different events to happen simultaneously in one state, and event4 can only occur after a state with event3 (i.e., in the state after the state with event3), not in the same next state.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event4 happens"" (both in the same state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate next state both event3 and event4 are true.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions (allowed transitions):
- Initially: event2.
- From event2 → next is event1 or event3.
- From event1 → next is event2 or event3.
- From event3 → next is event2 or event4.
- From event4 → next is event1.
(Repeated lines do not change these possibilities.)

Step 3 — Trace from the initial state:
- From the initial event2, the next state can be either event1 or event3.
- In this next state exactly one event holds (either event1 or event3). There is no rule that allows event3 and event4 to occur simultaneously in the same state.
- If the next state is event3, event4 can only occur in the following state (after that), not in the immediate next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 (both event3 and event4 in the same state) cannot hold in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens (event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (so equivalently: event1 happens, since if event1 happens C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- (Other rules: after event1 → event2 or event3; after event4 → event1 or event2 — these don't prevent event1 from occurring.)

Step 3 — trace possibilities from the initial event3:
- If after event3 we get event1 → event1 has happened.
- If after event3 we get event2 → then by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will happen next.

In every possible continuation from the given facts, event1 occurs. Therefore C1 is satisfied (since event1 occurs, making event2 ∨ event1 true) and event1 indeed happens, so C2 holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: event2 or event1.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens. So C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (since if event1 happens, C1 is satisfied).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event4 never appears from the initial state).

Step 3 — trace possibilities from the initial state:
- If after event3 we get event1, then event1 happens (C2 true).
- If after event3 we get event2, then the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 next (so event1 happens, C2 true).

In both possible continuations from the initial event3, event1 inevitably occurs. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2 = C1 holds AND event1 happens — equivalently, C2 just requires event1 happens (since event1 implies C1).

Examine the constraints and trace possibilities:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - If event1 happens immediately, then event1 occurs and C2 is satisfied.
  - If event2 happens instead, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur afterward, so again event1 occurs and C2 is satisfied.

Other rules (after event1 either event2 or event3; after event4 ...) do not prevent event1 from occurring.

Conclusion:
- In every allowed sequence starting from the given initial condition, event1 will occur, so C1 holds and event1 happens.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked:
- C2 asserts: (event2 happens and event4 happens) AND (event3 happens). We must determine whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Given conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event3 will occur).
- After event3, event4 must happen (so event4 will occur).
- After event4, event1 must happen, and after event1 event2 must happen — forming a cycle, but the key chain is 2 → 3 → 4.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- event2 has happened (given).
- Therefore event3 must happen (by the rule after event2).
- Therefore event4 must happen (by the rule after event3).

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:
- C1 (event2 and event4) holds because event2 happened and event4 follows.
- event3 also holds.
- Thus C2 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: event2 happens, event4 happens, and event3 happens (since C2 = C1 and event3, and C1 = event2 and event4).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
(There are also rules after event4→event1 and after event1→event2, giving a cycle.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur.
- Because event3 occurs, ""after event3, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur.
- Thus event2, event3, and event4 all happen.

Conclusion:
- C2 (which requires events 2, 3, and 4) is True.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules say: after event4, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 will happen (at least once) after the initial event4.
- After event1, event4 must happen, and then event1 again, etc., so we get a loop of event4 ↔ event1. Event3 is not forced by any rule, so C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") does not necessarily hold.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Even though C1 can be false, event1 does happen (as shown), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First, what is being asked:
- C2 = (C1) OR (event1 happens), where C1 = ""event3 eventually happens"".
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the initial facts and the ""after"" rules.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.

Trace the forced sequence from the initial state:
- At the start event4 has occurred.
- The rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen next.
- Then ""after event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 again, and this alternation (event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 ...) continues indefinitely.
- Event3 is never required by these rules, so C1 (event3 eventually happens) is not guaranteed.
- However, event1 does happen (indeed it must, immediately after the initial event4).

Therefore C2 = (C1) OR (event1 happens) is true because event1 does happen. Final answer: True.
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event3 eventually happens OR event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the disjunction: either C1 (event3 eventually happens) holds, or event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 has happened.
- Rules (relevant ones):
  - After event4, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, event4 must happen.
  - (Other rules involve event2 and event3 but do not force event3 to ever occur.)

Step 3 — trace allowed sequences
- From the initial event4, the rule “after event4, event1 must happen” requires that event1 happens (eventually).
- Once event1 happens, the rule “after event1, event4 must happen” requires event4 again, and then event1 again, etc. So there is a forced alternation event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 ….
- Nowhere is event3 forced; it may never occur, but that does not matter for C2.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Because event1 is necessarily going to happen (it must happen after the initial event4), the disjunction C2 (event3 eventually OR event1 happens) is satisfied regardless of whether event3 ever occurs.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is true given the rules and the initial event.

- C1 is ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- From the context: initially event1 happened. After event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4}. That means event3 may happen next, but it is not guaranteed (the choice could be event2 or event4).
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (it can be false if the next event is event2 or event4).
- C2 is simply the disjunction ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" which, in effect, asserts that event3 happens next. Since event3 next is not guaranteed by the rules, C2 is not guaranteed either.
- A counterexample: choose next = event2 (allowed). Then event3 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false and C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (i.e., immediately after the initial state)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" (so C2 is true iff event3 occurs either in the next state or at some (unspecified) time)

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial state:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event can be event2, event3, or event4.

Step 3 — produce a valid trace that violates C2:
- From event1, choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2, choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ...
This infinite trace follows all given rules and never contains event3. In particular, event3 does not happen in the next state (so C1 is false) and event3 never happens at all (so the second disjunct is false).

Conclusion:
- C2 is not guaranteed by the given information. Therefore: False.
---
False

Reason: From the initial event1, the next event could be event2 (the rule after event1 allows event2, event3, or event4). Take the path:
event1 -> event2 -> event1 -> event2 -> ...
This respects all given rules and never produces event3. On that path C1 (""event3 happens in the next state"") is false (the next state is event2), and ""event3 happens"" is also false (it never occurs). Hence the disjunction C2 is not guaranteed, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 claims: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2 claims: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the relevant condition:
- The context says: ""After event2, either event1, or event3 must happen."" That means immediately after event2, the next state must be event1 or event3; it cannot be event2.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 asserts the next state is event2, which contradicts the rule that after event2 the next state must be event1 or event3. Therefore C1 is impossible (false).
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and event4). Since C1 is false, C2 must also be false regardless of whether event4 could occur.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires event4 in the next state and also event2 in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen."" (i.e. the immediate next state following event2 must be event1 or event3.)

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- Since initially event2 happened, the immediate next state must be either event1 or event3.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur in the immediate next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold (event2 in the next state). Because C1 is false, C2 is false regardless of whether event4 could occur later.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds.""

Examine the context step by step:
- Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" forces the next state s1 to be either event1 or event3. It does not force event2 to occur in s1.
- Therefore C1 (event2 in the next state) is not guaranteed by the rules.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and additionally that event4 happens. Even though event4 could possibly occur later (for example if s1 is event1 then s2 could be event4), C2 depends on C1 being true as well — and C1 is not entailed.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens or (Event4 happens and Event1 happens).""

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 does happen.
- (For completeness: after event2, either event3 or event4 must happen; if event3 occurs then after it event4 must happen, so event4 also occurs. Thus both event1 and event4 will occur as well.)

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since event2 happens (entailed by ""after event1, event2 must happen""), the disjunction in C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" implies event2 happens.
- C2 is ""event2 happens or (event4 and event1)"". Since event2 happens, C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: event4 happens and event1 happens.
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the rules.

Step 2 — apply the rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
  - If event4 happens directly, event4 occurs.
  - If event3 happens, then by “after event3, event4 must happen,” event4 still occurs.
So in all cases event4 happens as well.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- event1 happened initially and event4 must happen, so C1 is true.
- event2 also happens (from event1 → event2), so C2 (event2 OR C1) is true regardless.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"", i.e. in every valid event sequence both event2 and event4 occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event4.
- After event1, the next event must be either event2, event3, or event4.
- After event3, no further events can occur.
- After event4, the next event must be event2.

Step 3 — find a counterexample sequence
- Start: event2 (given).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3, the sequence ends.

This valid sequence contains event2 but does not contain event4, so C1 does not hold in this sequence.

Conclusion
- Since there is a valid sequence where C1 fails, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution, both event2 and event4 occur.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, one of event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — find a counterexample execution
Consider this valid execution:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Next: choose event1 (allowed after event2).
- Next: choose event3 (allowed after event1).
- Then stop (after event3 no further events are allowed).

This trace respects all constraints but never contains event4. C1 (both event2 and event4 happen) is false in this execution, so C1 does not hold in all executions.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C2 says ""always (Event2 happens and Event4 happens)"".
- Event2 does happen initially, so Event2 is not the issue.
- From Event2 the rules allow either Event1 or Event4 to occur next.
- If we choose Event1, then from Event1 we may choose Event3 (rules allow Event2, Event3, or Event4 after Event1).
- After Event3 no further events can happen, so the run Event2 → Event1 → Event3 is a valid sequence and contains no Event4.
- That run violates C1, so C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. From event3, the next event can be either event1 or event2.
- If the next state is event1, then event4 is not true in that state, so ""Event4 always happens"" (C1) is already false there.
- If the next state is event2, the system forces alternation 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 …, so some states are event2 and thus event4 does not hold at every state.
- In no possible next state does it hold that event4 occurs at every subsequent state. Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---

---
Step 1 — interpret the statements
- Initially event3 happened.
- Rules:
  - After event4, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, event4 must happen.
  - After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
  - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., from a given state, in every future state event4 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the state immediately after the initial state, C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine possible next states
From the initial event3, the next state must be either event1 or event2.

- If the next state is event2: by the rules, after event2 must come event4, and then after event4 must come event2, so the system alternates between event2 and event4. But in the state where event2 occurs, event4 is not occurring, so ""event4 always happens"" is false at that next state.
- If the next state is event1: after event1 either event2 or event4 happens. If it goes to event2 (possible), we are in the same alternating situation as above, so there exist future states where event4 does not hold. Hence ""event4 always happens"" is false in that next state as well. Even if the immediate successor after event1 is event4, later states include event2, so ""always event4"" still fails.

Step 3 — conclusion
There are reachable next states (e.g., next = event2) where C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 means:
- C1 is ""event4 eventually happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. eventually (eventually event4).
- In temporal logic eventually(eventually p) = eventually p, so C2 is equivalent to C1. So it suffices to determine whether event4 must eventually happen.

Step 2 — use the constraints:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event1 must happen (so at some finite future point event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event4, event2 must happen; after event2, event4 must happen. Any occurrence of event2 or event4 forces a strictly later occurrence of the other, and so on.

Step 3 — eliminate possibility of event4:
- If event4 (or event2) ever occurs at some finite time, it forces an infinite alternating chain of event2 and event4 occurrences (each requires a later occurrence of the other).
- But event1 must occur at some finite time after the initial event3, and after event1 no events can happen. So there cannot be an infinite chain of events before event1. Therefore neither event2 nor event4 can occur before the required event1.
- They cannot occur after event1 either (no events allowed after event1). So event4 can never occur.

Conclusion:
- C1 (event4 eventually happens) is false, thus C2 is also false.

False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. ""eventually (event4 eventually happens)"". (In temporal logic this is equivalent to ""event4 eventually happens"".)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event1 must happen (so sometime after the initial event3, event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- The rules about event2 and event4 (after 4 → 2 must happen; after 2 → 4 must happen) only apply if 2 or 4 actually occur — they do not force 2 or 4 to occur by themselves.

Step 3 — trace and reasoning
- Because event3 occurs initially, event1 is required to occur later.
- Once event1 occurs, no further events can occur, so any event4 would have to occur before event1.
- Nothing in the conditions forces event4 to occur before event1; it's perfectly allowed for event1 to occur immediately after event3, with no event4 ever happening.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen, so C1 is not necessarily true.
- Therefore C2 (which is equivalent to C1) is also not entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 says: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., both events occur).
- C2 says: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there will be some point at which both event2 and event1 have happened.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So an occurrence of event2 is terminal — it prevents any further events.)
- The other rules (after event1 → event4, after event4 → event2 or event3, after event3 → event2 or event4) only matter if event1, event3, or event4 ever occur; none force event1 to occur initially.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Since event2 has already happened initially and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" no events can occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- There is no statement that event1 also happened initially. So we cannot conclude that both event2 and event1 have occurred at any time.

Conclusion
- C1 cannot be guaranteed to ever hold, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means: at some point (now or later) both event2 and event1 have occurred.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the constraints.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That forbids any event occurring after the (initial) event2.
- Other rules (what follows event1, event4, event3) are irrelevant if event1 cannot occur.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event2 already happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- There is no indication event1 happened before the initial state; the initial fact only asserts event2 happened.
- Therefore it is impossible for both event2 and event1 to hold at any time in the future (or be made to hold), so C1 cannot eventually hold.

Final answer
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 has happened.
- One rule says: after event2, no other events can happen. That blocks any future occurrence of event1.
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to have happened. Event2 already has, but event1 cannot happen after the initial event2.
- Nothing in the context says event1 also happened initially. Therefore C1 cannot become true at any time.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" — i.e. at some future time there is a state whose next state contains event4.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So at time 0 event2 holds.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes the state where event2 occurs terminal: no future state can contain any event (including event4).
- Other rules (after event4 → event2; after event3 → event1 or event2; after event1 → no other events) cannot be used because we are already in an initial event2 state and no further events can occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Starting from the initial state with event2, there are no possible event transitions to a state where event4 occurs. Therefore there is no time t such that the next state of t contains event4.

Conclusion
- C1 cannot ever become true at any time, so ""eventually C1 holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at some state's immediate successor).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future state, C1 is true — equivalently, event4 occurs at some time).

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (event2 occurs at the start).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — once event2 has occurred, no further events can ever occur in any later state.
- Other rules (after event4 → event2; after event1 → no events; after event3 → either event1 or event2) are irrelevant here because event2 already occurred initially and that forbids any subsequent events.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and that forbids any further events, event4 can never occur in any future state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires event4 to occur at some time. Since no events can occur after the initial event2, event4 cannot ever occur. Therefore C2 is false.

- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after some current state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point there will be a state whose next state has event4).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Therefore, once event2 has occurred (and it has occurred initially), no events can occur in any subsequent state.
- Other rules (after event4 → event2, after event1 → no other events, after event3 → event1 or event2) cannot introduce events after the initial event2 because no events can happen after event2.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event4 can never occur in any future state (nor in the immediate next state).
- Thus C1 never holds at any point, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 states
- C2 is the conjunction: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens).
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — check C1
- From the rules: event4 -> event2, event2 -> event3, and event3 -> event1.
- Chaining these gives event4 -> event2 -> event3 -> event1, so event4 -> event1.
- Therefore C1 is true (entailed by the context).

Step 3 — does event2 necessarily happen?
- We start with event1 (given).
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- If event4 occurs then event2 will follow (so event2 can happen).
- But it is also possible that after event1 the system always chooses event3 (e.g. sequence: event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> ...). In that case event4 and hence event2 never occur.
- Thus event2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Conclusion
- C1 is true, but event2 is not guaranteed, so the conjunction C2 is not entailed.
Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: event4 -> event1.
- C2: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens).

We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given context.

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event1 is true.
- event3 -> event1 (after event3, event1 must happen).
- event1 -> (event3 OR event4) (after event1, at least one of event3 or event4 must happen).
- event4 -> event2.
- event2 -> event3.

Step 3 — check C1:
- If event4 happens, then by event4 -> event2 and event2 -> event3 and event3 -> event1, we get event4 -> event1. So C1 is entailed. C1 is True.

Step 4 — check event2:
- From the initial event1, the rule event1 -> (event3 or event4) allows two choices.
  - If we choose event4, then event2 follows (so event2 happens in that branch).
  - But we may instead always choose event3 after each event1 (event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> ...). In that run event2 never occurs.
- Thus event2 is not guaranteed by the context (it is possible but not necessary).

Conclusion:
- C1 is true, but event2 is not guaranteed, so the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the rules:

- event3 -> event1 (after event3, event1 must happen).
- event1 -> (event3 or event4) (after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen).
- event4 -> event2.
- event2 -> event3.

Step 3 — check C1:
- If event4 happens, then by event4 -> event2 and event2 -> event3 and event3 -> event1, event1 will indeed happen. So C1 is entailed (true).

Step 4 — check whether event2 happens (needed for C2):
- From the initial event1, the rule event1 -> (event3 or event4) allows two possible continuations. If we choose event4 then event2 will follow, but we are free to choose event3 instead. For example, the trace initial event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> ... never produces event2. Thus event2 is not guaranteed (it is possible but not necessary).

Conclusion:
- C1 is true, but event2 does not necessarily happen, so the conjunction C2 is not entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 occurs.
- But after event3, event1 must occur (e3 -> e1). There is no transition e3 -> e3.
- Therefore it is impossible that from some point onward every step is event3 (i.e. impossible that ""event3 always happens"" ever holds).
- C2 asserts that eventually C1 (event3 always happens) holds. Since C1 can never hold, C2 is false.
---
First identify the meaning:

- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — interpreted as the invariant G(event3): at every step/timepoint the current event is event3.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — interpreted as F G(event3): there is some future time after which at every step event3 holds.

Examine the conditions and their consequences:

1. Initially event3 occurred. So at time 0 we had event3.
2. But the rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces the next event to be event1. So at time 1 the event is event1, which is not event3. Therefore C1 (every step is event3) is already false at time 1.
3. After event1 the system must choose either event3 or event4 next. Either choice yields a non-event3 step (if it chooses event4) or yields event3 followed (by rule 2) necessarily by an event1 afterwards. In particular, whenever event3 occurs, the next step must be event1, so you cannot have two consecutive event3 steps.
4. Because after any event3 an event1 is forced, it is impossible to reach a point after which every subsequent step is event3. There is no suffix of the run consisting only of event3 events.

Therefore C1 can never hold at all times, and C1 cannot eventually become permanently true. So C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""event3 always happens"" — i.e. from some time onward every event is event3.
- From the rules: after any event3, event1 must happen. So a 3 is always followed by a 1; two consecutive 3s cannot occur.
- Therefore you cannot reach a point after which every event is 3 (there will always be a 1 following any 3).
- Hence C1 can never hold eventually, so C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event3 happens) OR (event4 happens).
- C2 = C1 holds AND event1 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the context rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen → so event3 does happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen → event2 and event3 enforce each other (they occur).
- After event1, event4 must happen, and after event4, event1 must happen → event1 and event4 form a separate pair that only trigger each other if one of them occurs, but nothing in the context forces either to start.

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Because event2 happened initially, event3 must happen, so event3 does occur. Therefore C1 is true (event3 occurs).
- C2 requires event1 to happen as well. Nothing in the given rules forces event1 (or event4) to occur since the 1↔4 cycle is not initiated by any other event. Thus event1 does not necessarily happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 is true, but event1 does not follow from the context, so C2 is not true.

False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens).
- C1 is: event3 happens OR event4 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so starting from the initial event2, event3 will occur).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so 2 and 3 force each other to occur repeatedly).
- After event1, event4 must happen, and after event4, event1 must happen (1 and 4 form a separate mutual requirement, but neither is triggered by 2 or 3).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- From the initial event2, event3 must occur, and then event2 must occur again, etc. Thus event3 does happen (so C1 is true via event3).
- There is no rule forcing event1 (or event4) to ever occur, because the 1↔4 cycle is never triggered by 2 or 3.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- C1 holds (because event3 happens), but event1 does not necessarily happen. Therefore the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Initially event2 happened (given).
2. Rule: after event2, event3 must happen. Therefore event3 will happen at some later point.
3. Rule: after event3, event2 must happen. That yields further occurrences of event2 (possibly repeatedly), but importantly it does not force event1 or event4.
4. Thus event3 does happen, so C1 (""event3 or event4"") is true.
5. C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"". C1 does hold, but there is no rule or given fact that forces event1 to occur (event1 and event4 only force each other if one of them occurs, but neither is ever triggered by the given facts or rules).
6. Therefore event1 is not guaranteed, so C2 is not satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event4 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event4 eventually happens"") is true given the constraints.

Step 1 — identify the question
- C2 asserts that Event4 happens (and hence C1). We must decide if Event4 must happen given the rules and the initial event.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice).
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen (choice).
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — produce a valid trace that avoids Event4
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1, choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3, event1 must happen (rule).
- After that event1, again choose event3.
- Repeat: ... event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 ... indefinitely.

This infinite trace respects all rules and never produces event2 or event4. Therefore Event4 does not necessarily (i.e., is not forced to) happen.

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event4 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed (there exists a valid execution where it never happens).
- Hence C2 (which requires Event4 happens) is not true in general.

Final answer: False
---
You are asked whether C2 (""Event4 happens and C1 holds"") follows from the given constraints.

Interpretation and key points
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- From event1, either event2 or event3 must occur next (choice non-deterministic).
- From event2, either event3 or event4 must occur next.
- From event3, event1 must occur next.
- From event4, event3 must occur next.
- C1 is ""Event4 eventually happens."" C2 is ""Event4 happens and C1 holds"" (so C2 is equivalent to ""Event4 happens"").

Counterexample showing C2 is not guaranteed
- Start: event1 (given).
- From event1 choose event3. Then from event3 we must go to event1. From that event1 again choose event3, and so on.
- This yields the infinite sequence 1,3,1,3,1,3,... which satisfies all constraints but never includes event4.

Conclusion
Because there is a valid sequence of events consistent with the constraints in which event4 never occurs, C1 is not guaranteed, and therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds."" (which is equivalent to “Event4 happens” for our purposes)
We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen (so 3 → 1).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so 1 → {2 or 3}).
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen (so 2 → {3 or 4}).
- After event4, event3 must happen (so 4 → 3).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One possible infinite sequence: 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → … (choose 3 each time after 1). This never produces event4, so C1 is not guaranteed.
- Another possible sequence that produces event4: 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 1 … (choose 2 after 1, and then 4 after 2). So event4 can occur, but it is not forced.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a valid sequence starting from the initial condition that never reaches event4 (1 → 3 → 1 → …), event4 is not guaranteed to happen. Therefore C1 is not necessarily true, and C2 (which requires event4 to happen) is not necessarily true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: event2 happens and event4 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event3 happens (i.e., event2 and event4 happen, and event3 also happens).

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- From the initial event4, either event1 or event2 must occur next.
  - If event1 occurs, then event2 must follow (so event2 happens).
  - If event2 occurs directly, event2 happens.
- Thus event4 (initial) and event2 must both occur in every valid sequence — so C1 is always true.
- After event2, the next event may be either event3 or event4. It is allowed to choose event4. That yields a valid infinite sequence with no event3, e.g.:
  4 (initial) → 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → ...
  This sequence satisfies all rules but never includes event3.

Identify hypothesis: C2 = (C1 holds and event3 happens). C1 = (event2 happens and event4 happens).

Examine conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.

Reasoning:
- From initial event4, either event2 happens directly or event1 happens and then forces event2. So event2 will inevitably happen and event4 did happen initially, hence C1 is necessarily true.
- After event2, the next event can be event3 or event4. It is possible to choose event4 repeatedly (event4 -> event2 -> event4 -> ...), so event3 is not forced to occur.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed by the premises (event3 may never happen), so the hypothesis is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- C2 asserts: event4 and event2 both happen (C1), and event3 also happens. We must check whether this can occur given the transition rules.

Step 2 — Translate the rules
- Start: event4 happened.
- From 4 → next must be 1 or 2.
- From 1 → next must be 2.
- From 2 → next must be 3 or 4.
- From 3 → next must be 1, 2, or 4.

Step 3 — Find a valid sequence that satisfies C2
- Start with the initial event4 (given).
- From 4 take the transition to 2 (allowed). Now 4 and 2 have both occurred (C1 true).
- From 2 take the transition to 3 (allowed). Now event3 has occurred as well.

This sequence (4 → 2 → 3) respects all given rules and satisfies C2.

- The hypothesis: C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. eventually it will become true that event3 happens).

- Constraints: start at event1. From 1 the next event must be 2, 3, or 4. From 2 the next must be 4. From 4 the next must be 1. From 3 the next must be 1 or 2.

- Build a valid trace that never contains event3: 1 (initial) → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → ... This cycle 1,2,4 repeats forever and respects all given constraints but never includes event3.

- In that trace C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") is false, so C2 (""eventually C1"") is also false (there is no time at which C1 becomes true in that run).

Therefore C2 is False.
---
First identify the statements:
- C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future step event3 occurs).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = Eventually(C1) = Eventually(Eventually(event3)). (This is equivalent to Eventually(event3).)

Now examine the transition rules and construct a run that avoids event3 forever:
- Start: event1 happens.
- From event1 you may choose event2.
- After event2 you must have event4.
- After event4 you must have event1.
- Repeat the choice event1 → event2 → event4 → event1 → ...

This infinite trace 1,2,4,1,2,4,... never contains event3. So C1 (event3 eventually happens) is not guaranteed, and therefore C2 (that C1 will eventually hold) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — semantically, “eventually (eventually event3)”. This is equivalent to “eventually event3” (eventually∘eventually = eventually), so C2 is logically the same claim as C1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1: must follow with event2 or event3 or event4.
- After event2: must follow with event4.
- After event4: must follow with event1.
- After event3: must follow with event1 or event2.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample run
- Start: 1
- Choose 2 next (allowed after 1): 1 → 2
- After 2 must do 4: 1 → 2 → 4
- After 4 must do 1: 1 → 2 → 4 → 1
- Repeat the same choices indefinitely: 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → ...
This infinite trace obeys all given rules and never contains event3.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid run with no event3, ""event3 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. So C1 is not necessarily true, and therefore C2 is not true.

Sample responses:
First, simplify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" is therefore ""Event3 happens AND Event1 happens"".

Now trace from the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Consider the branch where event4 → event3. Event3 is terminal (no further events), so Event1 never happens in this branch. That makes C2 false in this possible run.

Although there are other runs where both Event1 and Event3 can occur (e.g. event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → event3), C2 is not guaranteed (it fails in the branch event4 → event3).

Therefore C2 is not entailed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" is equivalent to ""Event3 happens AND Event1 happens"" (both must occur).

Step 2 — examine the context / rules
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen (so event1 implies another event4 later).

Step 3 — check whether C2 must hold
- One possible sequence: event4 → event3. That satisfies ""after event4, event3"" and then stops (no further events). In this sequence event1 does not occur, so C2 is false in that model.
- Another possible sequence: event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → event3, in which both event1 and event3 do occur (so C2 can be true in some models).

Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the context where event3 occurs but event1 does not (so C2 is not guaranteed), C2 is not entailed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (A or A ≡ A).
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" — i.e. both Event3 and Event1 happen.

Step 2 — Examine the context and constraints
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen (so event1 leads back to event4, allowing further events).

Step 3 — Reason about possible sequences
- One possible sequence: event4 → event3. Because event3 is terminal, no event1 can occur afterward. In that branch Event3 occurs but Event1 does not, so C2 is false there.
- Another possible sequence: event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → ... and eventually event3 could occur later. In that branch both Event1 and Event3 can occur, making C2 true in that particular run.

Step 4 — Conclusion about entailment
The context allows both possibilities (a path with Event3 and no Event1, and a path with both Event1 and Event3). The hypothesis C2 (""Event3 happens and Event1 happens"") is not guaranteed by the context (it is not entailed). Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at every step from that point onward).
- From the initial state event4 happened; the next event can be 1, 2, or 3.
- To make C2 true, C1 must hold in that next state no matter which allowed next event occurs.
- Take the next state where event1 occurs (allowed after event4). From event1 the possible next events are 2 or 4, so event3 does not necessarily happen afterwards — C1 fails in that next state.
- Therefore C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- The hypothesis C1 (""Event3 always happens"") would require event3 to occur in every future state on every possible trace.
- From the rules: after event4 (initial), we could go to event1. From event1 we may go to event2 (or event4). From event2 we may go to event1 (or event4) — so we can choose the sequence event4 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... forever, never taking event3.
- That provides a valid trace in which event3 never happens, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; since there is a next-state trace (e.g. next = event1) from which we can still avoid event3 forever, C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens. The next state must be one of event1, event2, or event3.
- C2 claims that in the next state C1 (""event3 always happens"") holds. For C2 to be true, whichever next state occurs must guarantee that event3 holds at all future states.
- If the next state is event1, the allowed successors are event2 or event4, so event3 is not guaranteed thereafter (C1 fails).
- If the next state is event2 or event3, their successors also include non-event3 options (so C1 would still fail).
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens).
- C1 is: ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible continuation/trace).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about C1:
- Because after event1 we can have event2, event3, or event4, event4 is not guaranteed: there are allowed traces where event2 (or event3) occurs instead of event4.
- Therefore ""event4 always happens"" is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires C1 to hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- Also, even if one tried to force C1 true (i.e., require event4 in every trace), that would preclude event2 happening in any trace (because after event1 exactly one of the three happens and they are terminal), so C1 and ""event2 happens"" cannot both hold.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the context: event1 occurred, and then exactly one of event2, event3, or event4 must occur. After any of those (2, 3, or 4) no further events can occur.
- Therefore event4 is not guaranteed; event2 or event3 could instead follow event1. So C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false.
- C2 asserts C1 holds and event2 happens. Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 asserts both C1 holds and event2 happens.
- C1 says ""Event4 always happens.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Same for event3 and event4 (each is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possibilities:
- From event1 exactly one of {event2, event3, event4} will occur next, and then no further events can occur.
- Therefore event4 does not always happen (event2 or event3 could occur instead). So C1 is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to be true, C2 cannot be true. Also event2 and event4 cannot both occur because each is terminal after event1.

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event2 or event2"", which is equivalent to ""event2"". The context states ""Initially, event2 happened"", so C1 holds.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"", so C2 requires event3 to have happened in addition to event2.
- The context gives no statement that event3 happens, nor any rule that forces event3 to occur. All other rules only constrain what must happen after various events, they do not imply event3 occurs.
Therefore C2 cannot be concluded from the context, so C2 is False.

- Initially, event2 happened. So Event2 is true, hence C1 is true.
- There are rules about what must happen after various events (e.g. after event2 → event1 or event4; after event4 → event1; after event1 → event2; after event3 → event2 or event4), but there is no statement that event3 actually occurs.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires event3 to have happened in addition to C1. The context gives no evidence that event3 occurs, and none of the rules force event3 to occur. Therefore we cannot conclude event3 happened.

False

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event2 or event2"", which is just ""event2"". The context explicitly says ""Initially, event2 happened"", so C1 is True.
- C2 requires C1 and that event3 happens. The context gives a rule about what must happen after event3, but it never states that event3 actually occurs. Therefore we cannot conclude that event3 happens.

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened (at time t0).
- The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces the next state (t1) to have event1.

- At t1 we have event1, which is neither event2 nor event3, so C1 is false at t1.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What the hypothesis asks:
   - C2 is the statement ""Event3 happens OR C1 holds"".
   - C1 is ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e. event4 occurs in every possible continuation / in all runs).
   - We must decide whether, given the constraints, C2 is necessarily true.

2. Examine the constraints:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1 the next event must be 2, 3, or 4.
   - After event2 the next event must be 1 or 4.
   - After event3 the next event must be 1 or 2.
   - After event4 no further events can happen (terminal).

3. Show C1 is not guaranteed:
   - There are allowed runs that never contain event4, for example 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... repeats forever. So ""Event4 always happens"" is false (not entailed).

4. Show C2 is not guaranteed:
   - C2 would require that in every model either event3 occurs somewhere or event4 always occurs.
   - But there is a valid run with no event3 and no guarantee of event4, e.g. 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... repeating. This run contains no event3, and because the 1→2 loop avoids 4, event4 is not forced to occur in every run.
   - Thus neither disjunct holds in that valid scenario, so C2 is not entailed.

Therefore C2 is False.

- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds.""
- C1 states: ""Event4 always happens."" (read as: event4 is inevitable/in every valid continuation).
- We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed by the given rules (i.e., whether in every permitted execution C2 is true).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1 one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event2 one of {event1, event4} must happen.
- After event3 one of {event1, event2} must happen.
- After event4 no further events can happen.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample run
- Start: event1 (given).
- Choose event2 (allowed after event1).
- After event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... indefinitely.
This infinite run is allowed by the rules, contains no event3, and never reaches event4.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In that run, event3 does not happen, and event4 does not inevitably happen (so C1 is false).
- Therefore C2 (""event3 happens or C1 holds"") is not guaranteed by the rules.

False"

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""Event4 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — restate C1/C2:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: Event4 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So C1 is false (event1 does happen).
- Therefore C2 reduces to: Event4 happens.

Step 3 — show a valid trace that avoids event4:
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1 choose event3.
- After event3 do event2 (forced).
- After event2 choose event1.
- Repeat: after that event1 choose event3, then event2, then event1, ...  

This infinite loop (event1 → event3 → event2 → event1 → ...) respects all rules and never includes event4. So event4 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is not logically entailed by the context. Final answer: False.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: Event4 happens or C1 holds (i.e. Event4 happens OR Event1 does not happen).

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So C1 is false (it contradicts the given initial fact).
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4 → event1 must happen.

Since C1 is false, C2 reduces to “Event4 happens.”

Can we conclude Event4 must happen? No. There is a valid sequence that avoids event4 entirely:
- Start: event1 (given).
- Choose event3 after event1 (allowed).
- Then event2 (forced).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat the same choices indefinitely: event1 → event3 → event2 → event1 → ... 

This sequence satisfies all rules but never includes event4, so “Event4 happens” is not guaranteed. With C1 false and Event4 not forced, C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C2 is ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"".
- From the context, event1 happens initially, so C1 is false at the start.
- Therefore for C2 to be guaranteed true, event4 would have to necessarily occur at some point.
- But there is a valid infinite sequence that never contains event4: choose event3 after each event1. That gives 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → ... . All transitions are allowed (after 1 choose 3; after 3 comes 2; after 2 choose 1), and this avoids event4 forever.
- Since event4 is not forced in every possible sequence and C1 is false, C2 is not entailed.

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 asks:
- C1 says “Event4 always happens” (i.e., at every state/event occurrence).
- C2 asks whether C1 is true in the next state (the state immediately after the initial one).

Step 2 — use the given conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen → next state is event4.
- After event4, event1 must happen → then event1.
- After that event1 → event4, and so on.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- The system must alternate 1,4,1,4,... forever. Event4 occurs every other state, not at every state.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 at the next state:
- The next state is an event4 state, but from that state the very next state will be event1, where event4 does not occur. So “Event4 always happens” is false at the next state.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 occurs.
- Rule: After event1, event4 must happen → the next state is event4.
- Rule: After event4, event1 must happen → the following state is event1.
- Thus the system cycles: event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ...
- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") would mean event4 holds in every state, which is false because event1 occurs in alternate states.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (the next state is event4). But from that next state the very next step is event1, so event4 does not hold in every future state there either.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" means event4 holds at every state (a global/always property).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" asks whether, in the immediate successor of the initial state, the property C1 (event4 everywhere) is true.

Step 2 — examine the constraints
- Initially: event1 holds in the initial state.
- After event1 → event4 must hold in the next state.
- After event4 → event1 must hold in the next state.
- (Other rules: after event2 → event1 or event3; after event3 → event2 — these don't intervene on the 1↔4 loop given initial event1.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Initial state: event1.
- Next state: by after event1 → event4, so event4 holds.
- Following that: after event4 → event1, so the subsequent state has event1 again.
- Thus states alternate ... → event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event4 always happens"") is false in the initial state because some states (those where event1 holds) do not have event4.
- C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state (the state where event4 holds). But from that next state the successor state has event1 (no event4), so event4 does not hold at every future state there either. Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 occurs. From event3 we may choose either event1 or event2.
- To show C2 is not guaranteed, exhibit a valid infinite sequence that never produces event2. Choose event1 after event3, then event4 after event1, then event1 after event4, then event4 after event1, and so on:
  3 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 ...
- This sequence respects all the given ""after"" rules and never contains event2. Therefore ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is false along this sequence, and so there is no time at which C1 becomes true; hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also false in the system.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Transitions (from the context) form the graph:
  - 3 -> {1, 2}
  - 1 -> {2, 4}
  - 2 -> {1, 4}
  - 4 -> {1, 3}

- Starting at event3, choose the branch 3 -> 1 (this is allowed).
- From 1 choose the branch 1 -> 4 (allowed).
- From 4 choose 4 -> 1, and keep repeating 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 ... forever.

This infinite execution never visits event2, so ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed — C1 is false. C2 is the temporal nesting ""eventually (event2 eventually happens)""; in linear temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1. Since C1 is false (there exists a trace avoiding event2 forever), C2 is also false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e. at some future point event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point it becomes true that event2 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine transitions
- From 3 → {1,2}
- From 1 → {2,4}
- From 2 → {1,4}
- From 4 → {1,3}

Step 3 — construct a counterexample path
Start at 3, choose 1 (allowed). From 1 choose 4 (allowed). From 4 choose 1 (allowed). Repeat 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... forever. This infinite path contains no event2. Hence C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false at the initial state because there exists a possible future with no event2.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
Since C1 is false and there is a path that never reaches a state where event2 is inevitable, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false. (Also note F(F p) ≡ F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1.)

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to just ""Event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" therefore means ""Event2 always holds"" (i.e., event2 happens at every relevant point).

2. Use the context constraints:
- Initially event1 happened (so at that time event2 did not happen).
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.

3. Show C2 is not forced by the context:
- From the initial event1 we get event4, and after that the chosen next event could be event1 again. That yields a possible infinite trace: event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → … which never contains event2 at those times.
- In particular, at the initial time event2 does not hold, so ""event2 always holds"" is already false.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state.

Examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen (so the next state is either event3 or event4).
- The other rules constrain what must happen after those events, but they don't forbid event3 right after event1.

Trace possibilities for the next state:
- If after event1 the system chooses event3, then event3 does happen in the next state, so C1 (event3 does not happen) is false in that next state.
- If instead it chooses event4, C1 would hold in the next state. But because the rules allow either option, C1 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion:
- Since there is a possible next-state (event3) where C1 is false, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not necessarily true. Therefore the correct answer is:

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules say: after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen. So the next state is either event3 or event4.
- C2 asserts that ""event3 does not happen in the next state"" (i.e., C1 holds in the next state).
- That assertion is not guaranteed: the next state could be event3. If the next state is event3, C2 is false; if the next state is event4, C2 is true.
- Because the rules allow both possibilities, C2 is not necessarily true.

Therefore C2 is False (not entailed).
---
We start from: initially event1 happened. From event1 the next event must be either event3 or event4.

C1 says ""Event3 does not happen.""  
C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the next state event3 does not happen.

But from event1 the next event could be event3 (or event4). So there is a possible next state where event3 does happen. Therefore ""event3 does not happen"" is not guaranteed in the next state. A concrete counterexample: choose next = event3, which violates C1 in the next state.

You ask whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 = ""Event2 happens and Event4 happens"", and the rules plus initial condition are given.

Interpretation: C2 claims that in every possible future (starting from the initial event2), both event2 and event4 occur (at some times).

Examine the rules and construct a valid counterexample sequence that obeys all constraints but never contains event4:

- Start: event2 (given).
- After event2, we may choose event1 (allowed).
- After event1, choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3, choose event2 (allowed).
Repeat: 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ... .

Every step satisfies the ""after X, either Y or Z"" constraints, and this infinite sequence never includes event4. Event2 does occur (initially and repeatedly), but event4 does not. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed in all runs, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

- Hypothesis C1 states: ""Event2 happens and event4 happens."" C2 says C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible future following the rules, both event2 and event4 occur).
- Initial condition: event2 has happened.
- Transition rules:
  - After event2: either event1 or event3.
  - After event1: either event3 or event4.
  - After event3: either event1 or event2.
  - After event4: either event2 or event3.
- We need to check whether event4 must occur in all possible sequences (event2 already happens initially).
- Construct a valid sequence that avoids event4: start at event2 (given), choose event1 next (allowed), then choose event3 (allowed after event1), then choose event2 (allowed after event3). This yields the cycle 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ... which never includes event4.
- Because there exists a valid sequence in which event4 never occurs, C1 does not hold in all possible futures. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 always holds"", where C1 = ""Event2 happens and Event4 happens"".
- Initially Event2 has already happened, so the only question is whether Event4 must inevitably occur on every possible continuation.
- From the transition rules: after Event2 we can go to Event1 or Event3; after Event1 we can go to Event3 or Event4; after Event3 we can go to Event1 or Event2.
- Consider the valid run that avoids Event4: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... . This obeys all rules (after 2 goes to 1, after 1 goes to 3, after 3 goes to 1, etc.) and never produces Event4.
- In that run Event2 did happen (initially) but Event4 never happens, so C1 does not hold on that run. Therefore C1 does not hold in all possible executions.
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initial state s0: event4 holds.
- From event4 the rule allows either event1 or event2 next. Choose event1 in s1 (this is allowed).
- After event1 the rule forces event4 in s2.
- After event4 again choose event1 in s3, then event4 in s4, and so on.

This infinite trace s0:4, s1:1, s2:4, s3:1, ... never contains event2, so C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") never holds at any point in that trace. Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is not guaranteed by the context, so C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- What the hypothesis asks: C1 is ""Event2 happens in the next state."" C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., that at some future point there is a transition whose next event is event2. Interpreted as a system property that must hold (i.e., inevitability of some future state where event2 occurs).

- System rules:
  - Initially event4.
  - After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - After event1, event4 must happen.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - (After event3 → {2,4}, but event3 never occurs from the start.)

- Trace a possible run that never produces event2: start at event4, choose event1 (allowed). From event1 you must go to event4, and again you may choose event1, and so on:
  4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → ...
  This infinite loop is consistent with all rules and never contains event2.

- Because there exists a valid infinite behavior with no occurrence of event2, the claim that ""event2 eventually happens"" (C2) is not guaranteed by the system. Therefore C2 is False.
---
We want to know whether ""C2: C1 eventually holds"" is true given the rules. Interpret C1 as ""in the next state, Event2 occurs"", and C2 as ""there is some future state at which C1 is true"".

Given the rules:
- Initially Event4.
- After Event4, the next event is either Event1 or Event2.
- After Event1, the next event is Event4.
- After Event2, the next event is Event1.
- After Event3 (irrelevant here), next is Event2 or Event4.

From the initial Event4 you can immediately go to Event2 (so C1 would hold right away), but you can also choose Event1. If you choose Event1, you get:
Event4 -> Event1 -> Event4 -> Event1 -> Event4 -> ... ,
i.e. an infinite loop alternating Event4 and Event1 by always choosing Event1 when at Event4. In that run Event2 never occurs, so there is never a state whose next state is Event2; thus C1 never holds on that run.

Because there exists a valid run where C1 never becomes true, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed. Therefore the statement C2 is False.

False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (somewhere in the future).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, it is true that event1 will eventually happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and possible next states:
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- From event2 the rules say: next must be either event1 or event3.
  - If the next event is event1, then C1 is true in that successor (event1 has occurred).
  - If the next event is event3, then no other events can happen (event3 is terminal), so from that successor event1 will never happen — C1 is false there.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Because one possible immediate successor (the one where event3 occurs) makes C1 false, C1 does not hold in every next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
First, clarify the statements:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (somewhere in the future).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the immediate successor state, event1 will eventually happen.

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

So the immediate next state after the initial one can be either:
- event1 — then C1 holds (event1 already occurred), or
- event3 — and since no events can happen after event3, event1 will never occur, so C1 fails.

Because there is a possible next state (the one where event3 occurs) in which C1 is false, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Hypotheses:  
  C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens.""  
  C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = ""From the next state, Event1 eventually happens.""

- Initial condition: initially event2 happened. After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.

- Counterexample path: choose the allowed next event = event3. After event3, no other events can happen (terminal). Thus if event3 happens next, Event1 never happens.

- Conclusion: because there exists an allowed next-state execution (event3) where Event1 does not eventually occur, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C2 (""Event1 eventually happens"" AND ""event4 happens"") is true given the rules.

Step 1 — what C2 requires:
- C1: event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 holds AND event4 happens. So both event1 must eventually occur and event4 must occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules and start state:
- Initially, event3 has happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen. So event4 will occur (immediately after the initial event3).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so 2 → 3 → 4 …).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would be terminal).
- No rule allows any event to be followed by event1, and nothing forces event1 to ever occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state:
- From the initial event3 we get event4 (3 → 4).
- From 4 we get either 2 or 3. If 2, then 2 → 3 → 4 → …; if 3, then 3 → 4 → ….
- The system cycles among 3,4 (and possibly 2), but there is no transition or enabling rule that ever produces event1.

Conclusion:
- event4 does happen (so that part of C2 would be true), but event1 can never occur under the given rules, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 AND event4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- The rules force: after event3 → event4 must happen. So event4 will happen after the initial event3.
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 must happen. Both choices lead back to event3 (if 3 happens directly) or to event3 via event2 (since after event2 → event3). Thus the system can cycle 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ...
- Nowhere in the rules is event1 required to occur; it is only constrained that if event1 happens then nothing can happen afterwards. Therefore event1 may never occur.
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed. Since C1 can be false while event4 still occurs, the conjunction C2 (C1 and event4 happens) is not guaranteed.

A concrete valid trace that falsifies C2: 3,4,3,4,3,... (never event1). Hence C2 is False.
---
We ask whether C2 (""Event1 eventually happens"" AND ""event4 happens"") is true given the rules.

1. Start: initially event3 has happened.
2. From ""After event3, event4 must happen"" we conclude event4 does happen (immediately after the initial event3).
3. From ""After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen"" the next event is 2 or 3.
   - If event2 happens, then ""After event2, event3 must happen"", and then after that event4 must happen again — this yields a (2→3→4) loop.
   - If event3 happens, then after it event4 must happen again — yielding a (3→4) loop.
   In either case the system cycles among {2,3,4}.
4. There is no rule that allows event1 to occur after any of the reachable events (3,4,2), and event1 did not occur initially. Therefore event1 cannot ever occur in any possible continuation from the given initial state.
5. Thus C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is false. Although event4 does happen, the conjunction C2 (C1 and event4) is false because C1 is false.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurs. The rule ""After event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur sometime after that.
- The rule ""After event3, no other events can happen"" means the sequence can end once event3 happens.
- Nothing requires event2 to ever happen. A valid execution is: event1 (initial) → event3 (required) and then stop. This satisfies all constraints but does not include event2.
- C1 (event2 and event3 happen) therefore does not hold in every possible execution, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3 no other events can happen, so one valid sequence is: event1 → event3 (and then stop).
- That sequence contains event3 but not event2, so ""Event2 happens and event3 happens"" (C1) does not hold in that sequence.
- Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 = ""Event2 happens and event3 happens.""

Step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happens.
- Rule: after event1, event3 must happen (so event3 will occur at some point after the initial event1).
- Rule: after event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- There is no rule forcing event2 to occur after event1 (it is optional), only that if event2 occurs then it must be followed by event1 or event4, etc.

A counterexample trace that satisfies all constraints but does not satisfy C1 is:
- event1 → event3 (then stop).
This respects ""initially event1"", ""after event1 event3 must happen"", and ""after event3 no other events can happen"", but event2 never happens. Thus C1 does not hold in that trace.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.”
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” i.e. in the immediate successor state after the initial state, it is true that event1 will eventually happen.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- From event2 the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- From event3 the next event must be event4.
- From event4 the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- From event1 no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible runs from the initial state
- From the initial event2, one possible next event is event1. In that case event1 has happened immediately, so C1 holds in the next state.
- But from event2 the other allowed next event is event3. If we choose event3, then must go to event4, and from event4 we can choose event3 again. By always choosing event3 after event4 we get the infinite loop: event2 → event3 → event4 → event3 → event4 → ... In that run event1 never occurs, so C1 is false in that successor.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because there is a permitted next-state choice (event3) from the initial state that leads to a run where event1 never occurs, it is not guaranteed that C1 holds in the next state. C2 is therefore not true.

Final answer:
False
---
We want to decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true given the constraints.

1) What C2 says: In the next state (i.e. immediately after the initial state), C1 must hold. C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens"" — so C2 requires that from the next state, event1 is guaranteed to occur at some future point.

2) Relevant constraints:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Examine possible next-state continuations:
- From the initial event2, the next event could be event1 — then event1 has happened and C1 would hold.
- But the next event could instead be event3. From event3 we must go to event4, and from event4 we may go to event3 again. Thus there is a possible infinite loop 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... that never includes event1.

Because there exists a valid continuation from the next state that never reaches event1, event1 is not guaranteed to eventually happen from the next state. Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False

You ask whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true given the rules. C1 says ""Event1 eventually happens.""

- After event3, event4 must happen.

- From event2 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 must go to event4.
- From event4 choose event3 (allowed).
- Repeat 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 ... forever.

This infinite loop contains no event1, so from the next state (e.g. the state where event3 has just happened) it is possible that event1 never occurs. Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

- After event1: next is event2 or event3 or event4 (choice).
- After event3: next is event1 or event2 (choice).
- After event4: next is event1 or event2 or event3 (choice).

C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is not guaranteed from the initial event2, because event3 is an allowed alternative. C2 (""C1 always holds"") asserts that every next state is event1 in all cases, but the rules allow other events (e.g., event3 after event2, or event2 after event1), so C1 does not hold in all possible transitions.

Therefore C2 is False. 

False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 states: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- From the context, the initial event is event2. After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- That means the next state could be event3 (not necessarily event1). Hence C1 is not guaranteed to hold.
- Since there exists a possible next state (event3) where C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is true at the start because event3 happened initially.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") means that from every reachable state, event3 is guaranteed to occur at some future point.
- From event3 we must go to event4. From event4 we may choose event1. From event1 we may choose event2. From event2 we may choose event4. This yields the cycle: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... 
- That infinite cycle contains no event3 after the initial event3, so from the state at event4 (and later states in the cycle) it is possible that event3 never occurs again.
- Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to eventually happen from every state, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C2 says: ""Always, it is true that eventually event3 happens"" (i.e. from every point in time, a future event3 is guaranteed).

Step 2 — extract the transition rules (from the context)
- initial: event3 has happened.
- 1 -> {2, 3}
- 2 -> {3, 4}
- 3 -> {4}
- 4 -> {1, 2, 3}

(Several rules were repeated but these are the distinct transitions.)

Step 3 — look for a counterexample path that avoids event3 forever after some point
- Start at the initial event3, then follow allowed choices:
  3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ...
- Each step is allowed by the rules:
  3 must go to 4; 4 may go to 1; 1 may go to 2; 2 may go to 4; and repeat.
- This infinite trace contains no further event3 after the initial occurrence.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists an allowed infinite execution after which event3 never occurs again, it is not true that ""from every point in time, event3 will eventually happen.""
- Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the claims
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (True at the start because event3 already happened initially.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting this as the temporal property ""always (eventually event3)"" — i.e. from every reachable state, event3 is guaranteed to occur at some future time (equivalently: no matter where you are, you cannot avoid event3 forever).

Step 2 — list the transition rules (from the last event to the next)
- From event1 → {event2, event3}
- From event2 → {event3, event4}
- From event3 → event4
- From event4 → {event1, event2, event3}
Start: event3 occurred initially, so next must be event4.

Step 3 — exhibit a behavior that avoids event3 forever after the initial occurrence
After the initial event3 we must go to event4. From event4 choose event1. From event1 choose event2. From event2 choose event4. This yields the cycle:
3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → ...
This infinite trace never visits event3 after the initial event3. Thus there exists a reachable state (for example state = last event = 4) from which some executions avoid event3 forever.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists an execution (indeed an infinite cycle 4→1→2→4→...) that avoids event3 forever, the property ""always eventually event3"" does not hold.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" 
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That is, at some future point there is a state whose next state has Event2 (equivalently: Event2 occurs at some future step).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially Event1 has happened.
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event4 must happen (choice).
- After Event4, Event3 must happen.
- After Event3, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After Event2, one of Event1, Event3, or Event4 must happen (not needed further here).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- If after the initial Event1 we pick Event2 next, then C1 is true immediately and C2 holds on that run.
- But if after Event1 we pick Event4 next, then Event3 must follow, and after Event3 nothing else can happen. This run is: Event1 -> Event4 -> Event3 (terminal). In this run Event2 never occurs, so C1 never becomes true and C2 does not hold.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid execution (Event1 → Event4 → Event3) in which Event2 never occurs, C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. the immediate next event is event2).
- C2 says: ""Eventually there is a state at which C1 holds"" — equivalently, event2 occurs at least once later (if event2 occurs at some step, then there is a previous state whose next event is event2).
- From the rules: 1 -> {2,4}, 2 -> {1,3,4}, 4 -> {3}, and 3 is terminal.
- Starting from the initial event1, one possible allowed trace is: 1 then 4 then 3 (since after 1 you may pick 4, after 4 you must pick 3, then stop).
- In that trace event2 never occurs, so C1 never holds at any state; hence C2 does not necessarily hold.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate successor state contains event2).
- C2 says: ""Eventually C1 holds"" (there is some future state whose next state has event2).

From the rules:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.

Two possible continuations from the initial state:
1. event1 → event2. Then C1 holds immediately, so C2 is satisfied on this path.
2. event1 → event4. After event4, event3 must happen, and after event3 no further events can happen. The sequence is event1 → event4 → event3, and there is no state whose next state has event2. So on this valid trace C1 never holds and therefore C2 does not hold.

Because there exists a valid trace where C2 fails, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. Hence C2 is False."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 says: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.

Find a counterexample sequence consistent with the rules where event1 occurs but event2 does not occur afterward:
- Start: event2 (initial).
- After event2 choose event1 (allowed).
- After event1 choose event4 (allowed).
- After event4 nothing else can happen.

Sequence: event2, event1, event4. Here event1 happened, and no event2 occurs after it. That violates C1. Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---

---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" means: in any execution, whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs (somewhere in that execution).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" asks whether C1 is true in all executions allowed by the context.

Step 2 — Examine the context
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So every allowed execution begins with event2.
- The other rules constrain what can follow, but they do not remove the initial event2.

Step 3 — Reasoning about C1
- In every allowed execution event2 has occurred (at the start).
- Thus in any execution where event1 occurs, event2 is already present (it happened initially).
- Therefore the implication ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is satisfied in every execution.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in all executions, so C2 is True.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"") is true given the constraints.

Step-by-step:

- Constraints (paraphrased):
  - Initially event3.
  - After event1 → either event2 or event3.
  - After event2 → event3.
  - After event3 → either event1 or event4.
  - After event4 → event3.

- Hypothesis:
  - C1: event1 happens in the next state (i.e., from the initial event3 we go to event1).
  - C2: If C1 holds, then event4 happens (i.e., event4 must occur at some point thereafter).

Construct a valid trace consistent with the rules where C1 holds but event4 never occurs:
- Start: event3 (initial).
- Next (C1): event1.
- From event1: choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2: must go to event3.
- From event3: choose event1 again (allowed).
Repeat the cycle event1 → event2 → event3 → event1 → ... indefinitely, always choosing event1 after event3 and thus never choosing event4.

This infinite trace is permitted by the given rules, so event4 is not forced to happen even when C1 holds. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"") is necessarily true given the transition rules and the initial event3.

Step 2 — Understand the rules
- Initial: event3 has happened.
- After event1 → next is either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → next is event3.
- After event3 → next is either event1 or event4.
- After event4 → next is event3.

Step 3 — Assume C1 (the next state is event1) and examine consequences
- Start: t0 = event3 (given). C1 says t1 = event1.
- From event1 at t1, t2 must be either event2 or event3.
  - If t2 = event2 → then t3 = event3 → from that event3 at t3 you may choose event4 at t4, but you also may choose event1 at t4.
  - If t2 = event3 → then t3 may be event1 again (since event3 → event1 or event4). So you can loop: ... event1, event3, event1, event3, ... indefinitely.

Step 4 — Conclude whether event4 must happen
- Because there exists a valid infinite trace starting from t0 = event3 and t1 = event1 that forever alternates event1 and event3 (never producing event4), event4 is not guaranteed to occur when C1 holds.
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" (i.e., whenever the next state is event1, event4 will occur later)

Step 2 — Use the rules:
- Initial state: event3 happened.
- From event3: next must be event1 or event4.
- From event1: next must be event2 or event3.
- From event2: next must be event3.
- From event4: next must be event3.

Step 3 — Check whether event4 must occur whenever event1 occurs:
- If C1 holds (next state is event1), one possible continuation is: 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... (always choosing 3 -> 1), which never produces event4.
- Because there exists a valid continuation after event1 that never reaches event4, event4 is not guaranteed whenever event1 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So every execution starts with event2.
- There is a rule: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That forces event1 to occur after any occurrence of event2 (including the initial one).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since the initial event2 happens in every execution and after event2 event1 must happen, every execution will contain both event2 and event1. Thus C1 holds in every allowed execution.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., both events occur at some point).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — we must check whether in every possible sequence consistent with the given rules, both event2 and event1 occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 already occurs in every possible run (at the start).
- After event2, event1 must happen. That is a mandatory requirement: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur (eventually/next, depending on interpretation).
- The other rules (about what must follow event3, event4, event1) only constrain what can happen after those events; they do not prevent event1 from occurring after the initial event2.

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Because event2 happens initially and ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will necessarily occur in every allowed sequence.
- Therefore in every sequence both event2 and event1 occur, so C1 holds in all sequences.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has already happened, so the ""event2 happens"" part of C1 is satisfied.
- From event2 the rules say the next event must be either event1 or event4.
  - If event1 happens next, C1 is satisfied.
  - If event4 happens next, then after event4 either event1 or event3 must happen.
    - If event1 happens after event4, C1 is satisfied.
    - If event3 happens after event4, then after event3 event1 must happen, so event1 still occurs.
- Thus in every possible continuation from the initial event2, event1 will inevitably occur (within a finite number of steps). Since event2 already occurred and event1 will always occur, C1 holds in every run.

Therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 has happened, so ""event2 happens"" is already satisfied.
- From event2 the rules require either event1 or event4 next.
  - If event1 happens directly, then both event2 and event1 have occurred.
  - If event4 happens, then from event4 either event1 or event3 must happen.
    - If event1 happens from event4, again both have occurred.
    - If event3 happens from event4, the rule from event3 forces event1 to happen next, so event1 still occurs.
- In every possible branch (choices nondeterministic), event1 inevitably occurs after the initial event2.

Therefore in all possible executions C1 (event2 happens and event1 happens) holds, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., both occur at some times).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible allowed sequence from the initial state, both event2 and event1 occur).

Step 2 — examine conditions / transitions:
- Initially event2 has happened (so event2 already occurs).
- After event2 → either event1 or event4.
- After event4 → either event1 or event3.
- After event3 → event1 (must).
- After event1 → event2 or event3 (not needed here).

Step 3 — trace possibilities from the initial event2:
- From the initial event2, one branch goes directly to event1 (so event1 happens).
- The other branch goes to event4; from event4 either to event1 (event1 happens) or to event3, and from event3 event1 must happen. Thus every branch leads to event1 within at most two steps.

Since event2 already happened initially and every possible continuation forces event1 to happen, C1 holds in every possible sequence. Therefore C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 is ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen (this is stated twice, so it's unconditional and mandatory).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen — irrelevant unless event4 occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about the implication:
- Because the rules say unconditionally ""after event3, event2 must happen,"" any occurrence of event3 guarantees a subsequent event2.
- Therefore whenever event3 happens, event2 happens — exactly the content of C2 (since C1 just asserts event2 happens).

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says simply ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction repeats the same fact).
- C2 says ""if event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event3 happens then event2 happens.
- From the context: initially event3 happened, and the rules include ""after event3, event2 must happen"" (stated twice). That enforces that whenever event3 occurs, an event2 follows.
- Therefore whenever event3 happens, event2 does happen, so C1 holds. Hence C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is just the assertion that event2 happens.
- C2 is ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., if event3 happens then event2 happens.
- From the context: ""Initially, event3 happened."" and the rule ""After event3, event2 must happen."" (stated twice).
- Therefore event3 occurs and forces event2 to occur afterward, so C1 holds.
- Hence the implication in C2 is satisfied."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point the statement ""event3 eventually happens"" will be true).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Trace possible sequences starting from the initial event1:
- From initial event1 ⇒ event4 must occur next.
- After that event4 ⇒ choose event1 again (allowed). Then event4 must follow, then event1, etc. This yields the infinite sequence 1,4,1,4,1,4,... in which event3 never occurs.
- Alternatively, after event4 one could choose event2 and then get the infinite cycle 1,4,2,4,2,4,... again with no event3.

Because there exist valid behaviors (above cycles) in which event3 never happens, C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed. Since C1 need not hold, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" (F event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F (F event3)), i.e. ""eventually it will be true that event3 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transition rules:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace reachable events from the initial state:
- Start at event1 (given).
- From event1 → event4 (must).
- From event4 → either event1 or event2.
- From event2 → event4 and then again → (event1 or event2).
So the system can only visit events in the set {event1, event4, event2}, cycling among those. There is no rule that produces event3, and event3 was not the initial event. Therefore event3 can never occur.

Step 4 — conclude about the hypotheses:
- C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") is false.
- Hence C2 (""eventually C1"") is also false (if C1 never becomes true, it cannot later become true).

Final answer: False
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C2 is true. C2 asserts ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""event3 eventually happens"".

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

We can construct a valid infinite trace that satisfies all constraints but never produces event3:
- Start with event1 (given).
- By the rule after event1, do event4.
- After event4 choose event1 again (allowed by the rule ""after event4, either event1 or event2"").
- Repeat the cycle event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ...

This trace satisfies every requirement:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- Every event1 is followed by event4.
- Every event4 is followed by event1 (so the ""either event1 or event2"" requirement is satisfied by event1).
- event2 and event3 never occur, but there is no rule forcing them to occur.

Thus event3 does not necessarily eventually happen (C1 is not guaranteed). Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also not guaranteed. (Note: in temporal logic F F p is equivalent to F p, so C2 would be equivalent to C1 anyway.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 never happens).
The question: Is C2 true or false?

Step 2 — inspect the conditions and trace events:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur next (or at least eventually).
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore once event2 occurs, event1 must occur thereafter.

Thus starting from the initial event4, the required sequence includes event2 and then event1. So Event1 does eventually happen, so C1 is true.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
You're asking whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true given the rules. C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 has happened.
- From ""After event4, event2 must happen"" we get that event2 occurs next (or at least eventually).
- From ""After event2, event1 must happen"" we get that event1 occurs after that.
- Therefore event1 does eventually happen, so C1 is true.

C2 asserts the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False

- Hypotheses: C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 does not eventually happen).

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:

- Hypothesis: C1 says ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" C2 says ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every allowed sequence of events C1 is true).
- From the context: initially event1 happened (given). So event1 happens in every possible sequence.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur after that initial event1 in every sequence.
- Therefore in every allowed sequence both event1 and event2 occur (event1 initially, event2 thereafter). That means C1 holds in all models.
- Hence C2 (“C1 always holds”) is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially, event1 happened (given). So event1 occurs.
- There is a rule ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Therefore event2 must occur (after the initial event1).
- Thus both event1 and event2 occur in every allowed sequence that starts from the given initial state, so C1 holds.
- Because the initial fact and the rules force those occurrences in all models, C1 always holds; therefore C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:
- The hypothesis C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- The scenario states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has already occurred.
- The rules include ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Since event1 did happen initially, event2 must occur (in every valid continuation).
- Therefore both event1 and event2 occur in every possible execution starting from the given initial condition, so C1 holds in all cases.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds; given the above, that assertion is true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the claims
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens"" (there exists a future occurrence of event4).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" i.e. from every reachable state, event4 will eventually occur (in temporal logic: G F event4).

Step 2 — Use the given rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen → so C1 is true in the initial state.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — Find a counterexample to C2
- From the start: event3 → event4 (forced). After that, choose the branch event4 → event2 (allowed).
- After event2, no further events can happen, so from the state after event2, event4 will not happen in the future. Thus ""event4 eventually happens"" is false at that state.

Conclusion
Because there is a reachable state (after event2) from which event4 will never occur, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initial condition: event3 has happened.
- Rule: after event3, event4 must happen. So starting from the initial state, event4 will occur — C1 holds for the initial state.
- Rule: after event4, either event1 or event2 must happen. If event2 happens, the rule “after event2, no other events can happen” makes the run terminate.
- C2 says “C1 always holds,” i.e. in every reachable state it is true that event4 will eventually happen in the future. Consider the reachable state reached after the sequence: event3 → event4 → event2. In that state no further events can occur, so event4 will not occur in the future from that state; therefore “event4 eventually happens” is false at that state.
- Because there exists a reachable state where C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 eventually happens (in the run).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible valid run/event sequence, event4 eventually happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. (So every valid run starts with event3.)
- After event3, event4 must happen. (So whenever event3 has occurred, event4 must occur subsequently.)
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen. (Gives what may follow event4.)
- After event1, event4 must happen. (If event1 occurs it forces another event4 later.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs, the run stops there.)

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Because the run starts with event3 and ""after event3, event4 must happen"", event4 is forced to occur in every valid run (it must happen sometime after the initial event3).
- Therefore C1 holds in every valid run.
- Since C1 holds in all possible runs (given the initial condition and constraints), C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened, so ""event1 happens"" is true.
- The rules say: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen in the next state. That forbids event4 in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""event4 happens in the next state"") cannot hold.
- C2 requires both event1 and C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (i.e. Event1 happens and Event4 happens in the next state)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true now).
- The rule ""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"" (given twice, but redundant) means the immediate next state after event1 can only be event2 or event3 — not event4.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- From the rule after event1, event4 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is false as well (even though event1 did happen initially).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds (so: Event1 happens now and Event4 happens next).

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (this rule appears twice but is the same constraint).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- Because event1 happens, the rule “after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen” forces the next event to be event2 or event3.
- Therefore event4 cannot happen in the next state immediately after event1.
- That makes C1 false in any situation where event1 occurs immediately before the next state.
- Since C2 requires both event1 and that event4 happens next, C2 cannot be satisfied.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is true or false given the context rules.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen. So the only event that actually occurs is event4; event1, event2, event3 cannot occur after the initial event4.
- Other rules: after event1 → event4; after event2 → no further events; after event3 → event1 or event2. (These are irrelevant once event4 has already occurred and no further events can occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
C1: ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens."" In every timeline consistent with the context, event2 never happens (because the initial event4 stops all further events). An implication with a never-true antecedent is vacuously true, so C1 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" We just established C1 does hold. But event3 does not happen in the actual timeline (no events can occur after the initial event4). So the antecedent of C2 is true while its consequent is false; therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and C1
- Context facts:
  - Initially event4 happened.
  - After event4 no other events can happen (so once event4 has occurred the run is over).
  - After event1, event4 must happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
  - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens.""
  - In every allowed run event4 has already happened initially, and no events can occur after it. So there is no allowed run in which event2 occurs without event4 having occurred (indeed event2 cannot occur at all).
  - Thus C1 is true (vacuously/necessarily true under the given context).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that from C1 being true it follows that event3 happens.
- Nothing in the context forces event3 to occur; in fact, because event4 already happened initially and blocks any further events, event3 cannot occur in any allowed run.
- So C1 can hold (and does), while event3 does not happen. Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens.""
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens.""

We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen. So once event4 occurred (and it did initially), no further events (including event1, event2, event3) can occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 would be terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (but those cannot occur because event4 already happened).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- C1 says ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens."" In the actual scenario no event2 can ever happen (event4 already happened and prevents further events), so the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is false. A material implication with a false antecedent is true, so C1 holds (vacuously) in this scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires that if C1 holds then event3 happens. We have C1 holding (vacuously), so C2 would require event3 to actually happen.
- But event3 cannot happen because event4 happened initially and prevents any further events.
- Therefore the consequent of C2 is false while its antecedent (C1) is true, so C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., at every point/event occurrence, event4 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point from then on, event4 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible execution(s)
- The initial required sequence is event2 → event3.
- After event3 the run terminates; no further events (so no event4 occurs at any time in this run).
- There is no way to reach event1 or event4 from the initial event2 because the mandatory event3 follows and then the run ends.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event4 always happens"") is false in this execution (event4 never occurs).
- Therefore C2 (""event4 eventually always happens"") cannot become true (there is no future point from which event4 holds always).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" (i.e., event4 occurs — in the run described — rather than never.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future point C1 becomes true — equivalently, there will be a time from which event4 always happens.)

Step 2 — what the conditions force
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- The rules about event1 and event4 do not apply because event1 did not occur initially.

Step 3 — trace and consequences
- The only possible sequence given the initial condition and constraints is: event2 → event3, then stop. Event4 never occurs in this run.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false (event4 does not happen).
- C2 is false: there is no later point at which ""event4 always happens"" becomes true, because the run ends after event3 and event4 never occurs.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event2, event3 must occur.
- After event3, no further events can occur (terminal).
- Thus the only possible run is event2 → event3 and then stop; event4 never occurs.
- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false in that run.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") would require some future point after which event4 always occurs, but no such point exists because the run terminates without event4.
Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., at the immediate next step from the current state.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, C1 is true — equivalently, event1 happens in the state after the next one.)

Step 2 — interpret the constraints
- Initially event2 happened (so the current state follows an occurrence of event2).
- After event2, event4 must happen. Thus the immediate next state must have event4.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So states will alternate 2 ↔ 4 indefinitely.
- After event1 (or event3), no other events can happen (they are terminal), but nothing forces event1 or event3 to occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence from the current state
- From the current state (which follows event2), the next state must be event4 (by the ""after event2, event4 must happen"" rule).
- Therefore the next state is not event1; C1 is false.
- In that next state (which is event4), the following state must be event2 (by ""after event4, event2 must happen""), so event1 still does not occur there. Thus C1 is also false when evaluated in the next state.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., one step from now.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the next state, C1 is true — equivalently, Event1 happens two steps from now.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace possible events
- Initially event2 happened (current state = event2).
- After event2, event4 must happen (so the next state must be event4).
- After event4, event2 must happen (so two steps from now is event2).
- Events 1 and 3 are terminal (after them no further events), but neither is forced anywhere in this sequence.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event1 in the next state) is false because the next state must be event4.
- C2 (event1 in two steps) is also false because two steps from now must be event2, not event1.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., the immediate next event is event1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the next state, C1 is true — equivalently, event1 happens two steps from now.

Step 2 — apply the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event4 must happen → the immediate next event after the initial state is event4.
- After event4, event2 must happen → the event after that (two steps from the initial) is event2.
- (Events 1 and 3 are terminal when they occur, but they are not forced here.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event1 is the immediate next event) is false, because the next event must be event4.
- C2 asserts event1 happens two steps from now. Two steps from the initial event2 is event2 (because of the required 2 ↔ 4 alternation), not event1. So C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens).
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (i.e. event3 → event3).

Step 2 — Examine conditions
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice each time).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences from the start
- From initially event4 → event3 (forced) → event1 (forced).
- From event1 you can either:
  a) go to event2, ending the sequence (event2 happens), or
  b) go to event3, which forces event1 again, and you face the same choice again (possibly looping forever between event1 and event3).

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and event2
- C1 is trivially true (p → p).
- Event2 may happen in some branches (if after some visit to event1 you choose event2), but it is not guaranteed: you can always choose event3 forever and never reach event2.

Conclusion
- Because event2 is not compelled by the rules (it is possible but not necessary), C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens) is not entailed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (holds trivially).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" So C2 requires event2 to occur (C1 is already true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace possible sequences
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event3 must happen → sequence begins: 4 → 3.
- After event3, event1 must happen → 4 → 3 → 1.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen:
  - If event2 happens next, sequence is 4 → 3 → 1 → 2 and then stops (after event2 no other events can happen). In this branch event2 does happen.
  - If event3 happens next, we get 4 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 ... (a loop of 3 and 1) and event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because there is an allowed execution where event2 never happens (the 3↔1 loop), the context does not force event2 to occur in all cases. Therefore C2 (which requires event2) is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) so C1 is always true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" So C2 is equivalent here to ""event2 happens"" (since C1 is true).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (a nondeterministic choice).
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminates).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the start: event4 → event3 → event1.
- After that event1 can lead to event2 (and then stop) or to event3.
- If one always chooses event3 after event1, the sequence can be event4 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... forever, never producing event2.
- That infinite execution satisfies all given rules and never contains event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 is not guaranteed to occur (there is a valid execution without it).
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the rules as constraints on the next event:
   - Initially event1 occurs.
   - After event1 the next event must be event2.
   - After event2 the next event must be either event1 or event4.
   - After event4 the next event must be event2.
   - After event3 the next event must be event2 (but event3 is never forced to occur).

2. Start from the initial event1:
   - Step0: event1 (given).
   - Step1: must be event2 (by ""after event1 → event2"").
   - Step2: after that event2 → next is either event1 or event4.

3. Two possible continuations from every occurrence of event2:
   - If event2 → event1, then next is again event2 (so the pattern becomes …,1,2,1,2,…).
   - If event2 → event4, then event4 → event2, giving the pattern …,2,4,2,4,2,…

   In every case event2 appears every other step, never twice in a row.

4. Therefore it is impossible for event2 to hold at every time step from some point onward (i.e., you can never reach a state where ""event2 always happens"" holds permanently), because the rules forbid consecutive event2 events.

5. So C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false, and hence C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") is also false.

Final: False.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event1 happens initially.
- Rules (interpreted as immediate next-step obligations):
  - After event1 → event2 must happen next.
  - After event2 → either event1 or event4 must happen next.
  - After event4 → event2 must happen next.
  - After event3 → event2 must happen next (event3 never forced here).

- From the initial event1 we get event2 next. From that event2 we must go to either event1 or event4. In either case the next step is not event2 (it is event1 or event4), and then the following step is event2 again. So valid traces alternate: ...1 → 2 → 1 → 2... or ...1 → 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → 2... — event2 appears repeatedly but never at every consecutive step.

- C1 (""Event2 always happens"", i.e. at every time point) is false because there are mandatory steps (event1 or event4) where event2 does not hold.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. from some point onward event2 holds at every time) is therefore false as well: after any event2 the rules force a different event next, so you cannot reach a suffix of the run where every step is event2.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step by step):

1. Initially event1 happened.
2. The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" therefore forces event2 to happen (so event2 will occur at least once).
3. Whenever event2 happens, the rule ""After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen"" forces one of event1 or event4 next.
4. Both of those then force event2 again: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event4, event2 must happen"".
5. So once event2 occurs, the system is trapped in a cycle that forces event2 to occur again and again (event2 → (event1 or event4) → event2 → ...). Thus event2 will keep occurring indefinitely.
6. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is therefore true from the start (event2 recurs forever). Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true (it already holds immediately).

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happens.
- The rules state that after event1, no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal; there is no next state or successor where further events occur.
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is already false in the initial state because event1 occurred but event2 did not.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. But there is no next state to evaluate C1 in, so C2 cannot be true.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- Initially event1 happened. But the context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" so there is no event after that initial event1 (event2 does not happen then). Thus C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state. Because no events can occur after the initial event1, in the next state event1 does not occur. An implication ""If event1 happens then event2 happens"" is vacuously true whenever event1 does not occur. Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (a state formula.)
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (the next-state modality applied to C1.)

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - Explicit rule: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So there is no successor state after the initial state.

3. Evaluate C2 under standard ""next"" semantics:
   - C2 claims that there is a next state and that C1 is true there.
   - But there is no next state (because event1 forbids any following events), so the ""next"" state does not exist.
   - Under standard temporal semantics, ""X φ"" (φ in the next state) is false if there is no next state. Therefore C2 is false.

(Also note: C1 is already false in the initial state because event1 occurs there while event2 does not, but that is extra — the crucial point is there is no next state, so C2 is false.)"

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

1. Identify hypothesis: C2 asserts both (a) C1 — ""Event4 eventually happens"" — and (b) ""event1 happens.""
2. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 will happen at some point.
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 and event2 can alternate indefinitely).
   - The rules involving event3 and event4 are only triggered if event3 or event4 occur; they do not force event3 or event4 to occur.
3. Conclusion:
   - Event1 is guaranteed to happen (so the second conjunct of C2 is true).
   - Event4 is not forced by any rule and is not implied by the given facts, so C1 (""Event4 eventually happens"") does not necessarily hold.
   - Therefore the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initially event2 happened (given).
2. The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" implies event1 will (eventually) happen because event2 has already occurred.
3. C1 states ""Event4 eventually happens"" — the hypothesis assumes C1 holds.
4. Therefore, with C1 true and event1 established from step 2, the conjunction C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens) is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
First identify what's asked: we must decide whether C2 (""Event4 eventually happens"" AND ""event1 happens"") is entailed by the context.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur (triggered by the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen, so event1 and event2 will alternate indefinitely.
- There is no rule that causes event4 to occur (nothing implies or forces event4).

Trace consequences:
- Event1 is guaranteed (because initial event2 → event1).
- Event4 is not guaranteed or implied by any given rule; it may or may not ever happen.

Therefore C1 (""Event4 eventually happens"") is not supported by the context, so the conjunction C2 is not supported.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, the initial event is event3. After event3 one of event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- C2 asserts: if C1 holds, then event2 happens. So we must check whether in every timeline consistent with the given rules and with C1 true, event2 necessarily occurs.
- C1 says: if event4 happens, then event1 happens. That can be satisfied by a timeline where event1 occurs before event4.
- A concrete timeline consistent with the rules and with C1 true is: event3 → event1 → event4. This is allowed because after event3 we can have event1, and after event1 we can have event4. Event4 is terminal, and C1 is satisfied because event1 did happen when event4 happens.
- In that timeline event2 never occurs. Hence there exists a model where C1 holds but event2 does not.
- Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed, so C2 is False.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

1) Identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event4 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.
We must check whether every model (every allowed event sequence) that satisfies the context and in which C1 is true also contains event2. If not, C2 is false.

2) Use the context to build a counterexample
- Context allows the sequence: event3 (initial) → event1 → event4 (then stop).
  - After event3 one of {event1,event2,event4} must happen — we pick event1.
  - After event1 one of {event2,event4} must happen — we pick event4.
  - After event4 no further events can happen — terminal.
- In this sequence: event4 does occur, and event1 also occurs (earlier). So C1 is true in this model.
- But event2 never occurs in this model.

3) Conclusion
Because there is a valid model (consistent with the context) where C1 is true but event2 does not occur, the implication C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context rules. Formally, C2 is false only if there is a possible sequence (model) consistent with the context in which C1 is true but event2 does not occur.

Step 2 — restate the context rules (as transitions)
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1, one of {event2, event4} must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event4} must happen.
- After event4, no further events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — unpack C1
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens."" This requires that in any sequence where event4 occurs, event1 also occurs (it could be before event4).

Step 4 — produce a counterexample sequence
- Consider the sequence: 3 -> 1 -> 4.
  - This follows the rules: after 3 we pick event1; after 1 we pick event4; after 4 we stop.
  - In this sequence event4 occurs, and event1 also occurs, so C1 is true in this sequence.
  - Event2 never occurs in this sequence.

Step 5 — conclude about C2
- We have a model where C1 is true but event2 does not happen, so the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is false (it fails in this model).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happened (given).
- The rule ""After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen"" means the next event is one of {1,2,4}.
  - If event1 happens immediately, then both event3 and event1 have happened.
  - If event2 happens, the rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen afterward.
  - If event4 happens, the rule ""After event4, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen afterward.
- In every possible branch after the initial event3, event1 will occur (either immediately or forced later). Since event3 already occurred, both event3 and event1 occur in every allowed execution.

Therefore C1 (event3 happens and event1 happens) holds in all executions, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the rules.

1) Identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event3 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible future/execution, C1 is true).

2) Given conditions:
- Initially event3 happened (so event3 is true).
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must occur.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- After event1, event4 must occur.
- After event4, event1 must occur.

3) Reasoning over all branches from the initial event3:
- If after event3 we get event1, then event1 occurs immediately.
- If after event3 we get event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must occur"" forces event1 to occur next.
- If after event3 we get event4, the rule ""after event4, event1 must occur"" forces event1 to occur next.
Thus in every possible branch following the initial event3, event1 will occur (possibly after one intermediate event). The additional cycle event1 -> event4 -> event1 simply ensures event1 recurs, but is not needed for the inevitability.

4) Conclusion:
Because event3 did happen initially and event1 is forced to occur in every possible continuation, C1 holds in all executions. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the conditions.

1) Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event1 happens."" (i.e., both events occur in a run)
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — interpreted as: in every possible execution consistent with the rules, C1 is true.

2) Examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened (so event3 occurs in every execution).
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.

3) Reason about possible executions:
- From the initial event3, the next event must be one of {1,2,4}.
  - If it is event1, then event1 occurs.
  - If it is event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur next.
  - If it is event4, the rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur next.
- Therefore, in every possible execution starting from the initial event3, event1 will occur (indeed, after the first or second step it must occur). Since event3 happened initially, both event3 and event1 occur in every execution.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and Event4 eventually happens"" (i.e., Event2 ∧ C1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (So at least one of event2 or event3 follows event1.)
- If event2 happens, then event3 must happen afterwards.
- If event3 happens, then event4 must happen afterwards.
- After event4 nothing else can happen (event4 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- One possible sequence: event1 → event2 → event3 → event4. This satisfies all constraints and makes C2 true.
- Another possible sequence: event1 → event3 → event4. This also satisfies all constraints (because after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen, here event3 does) but in this sequence event2 does not happen. C1 (event4 eventually happens) holds, but the conjunct ""event2 happens"" fails.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the premises in which event2 does not occur, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — conditions summary:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Branch A: event1 → event2 → event3 → event4 (ends).
- Branch B: event1 → event3 → event4 (ends).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event4 eventually happens): true, because both branches lead to event3 and then event4.
- C2 requires both (a) event2 happens and (b) C1 holds. Although C1 holds, event2 is not guaranteed (Branch B skips event2). Thus C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 says: ""Event2 happens and Event4 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:

- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- If event2 happens, then event3 must happen afterwards.
- If event3 happens, then event4 must happen afterwards.
- After event4 nothing else can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences after event1:
- Path A: event1 → event3 → event4. (Allowed by ""after event1 either event2 or event3""; event3 forces event4; terminal.)
  - Here Event4 happens, but Event2 does not.
- Path B: event1 → event2 → event3 → event4. (event2 forces event3, which forces event4; terminal.)
  - Here Event2 and Event4 both happen.

Step 4 — conclude:
- Event4 (C1) happens in every possible path, so C1 is true.
- Event2 does not happen in all possible paths (see Path A), so ""Event2 happens and Event4 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. So the immediate next state must be either the state where event2 happens or the state where event4 happens.
- C1 is the proposition ""if event2 happens, then event3 happens."" In a state where event2 happens, event3 does not also happen in that same state, so C1 is false there (antecedent true, consequent false).
- Because one possible next state (the event2-next state) makes C1 false, C1 does not hold in the next state overall.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial: event3 happened.
- From event3, the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" That requires that whenever event2 occurs, it is followed by event3.
- But after event2 the system allows event1, event3, or event4. So there is a possible continuation event2 → event1 (i.e. event2 can be followed by event1, not event3). That makes C1 false in any state where event2 can occur and be followed by event1.
- Consider the next state after the initial event3:
  - If the next state is event4, C1 would be vacuously true there (event2 cannot occur from event4).
  - If the next state is event2, C1 is false (because event2 might be followed by event1 instead of event3).
- Since the next state after event3 can be event2, and in that case C1 does not hold, the claim ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The next state after the initial event3 must be either event2 or event4.
- C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" That requires that whenever event2 occurs, event3 necessarily occurs.
- But the rules say: after event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen — event3 is only one possible successor, not guaranteed. In particular, after event2 it could be event1 (or event4) instead of event3.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to hold in a state where event2 occurs. Since the next state could be one where event2 happens and C1 would then fail, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 says ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" (equivalently: event2 happens).
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution from the initial situation, event2 must occur.

Step 2 — restate the rules
- Initially: event1 has happened.
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- After event2: event1 must happen.
- After event3: event1 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen (and then event1 must follow after that).

Step 3 — trace possible executions
- From the initial event1, the system may choose event3. Sequence: 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... . This infinite execution satisfies all rules (after each 1 we choose 3, after each 3 we return to 1) and never contains event2.
- Also from 1 we could choose 4, giving 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → ... which also can continue without ever choosing event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exist valid executions (e.g. repeating 1→3) in which event2 never occurs, C1 does not hold on all executions. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is simply ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction ""event2 and event2"" is equivalent to event2).
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. in every possible execution/trace C1 holds (event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must occur.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- After event3, event1 must occur.
- After event4, event3 must occur.

Step 3 — find a counterexample trace
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1 choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3, event1 must occur.
- Repeat: after event1 choose event3 again, etc.

This yields an infinite trace 1,3,1,3,1,3,... in which event2 never occurs. Thus C1 does not hold in that execution, so C1 is not true in all executions.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1 says ""Event2 happens"" (the repetition is redundant).
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"", i.e. event2 must hold in every possible future situation.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen (non‑deterministic choice).
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- From the initial event1 we are free to choose event3 (because after event1 either 2, 3, or 4 must happen).
- If we choose event3, then event1 must happen next (by rule).
- From that event1 we can again choose event3, and so on.
- This yields an infinite execution: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → … in which event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- Because there exists a valid execution where event2 never happens, it is not true that ""event2 always holds.""

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4, the rules require that the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- Therefore the next state can contain event2 or event3, but not event4 or event1.
- C1 requires both event4 and event1 to happen together; that cannot hold in the next state.
- So C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event1 happens"" (both hold).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the current one, both event4 and event1 must be true.

Step 2 — relevant conditions from the context
- Initially event4 happened (current state: event4).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen next (so the next state from event4 is restricted to event2 or event3).
- The other rules (after 1 → 2 or 4; after 2 → 3 or 4; after 3 → 1 or 4) do not allow event1 or event4 to occur immediately after the initial event4 — only event2 or event3 can.

Step 3 — reasoning about C2
- Since from the current state (event4) the next state must be either event2 or event3, the next state cannot simultaneously contain event4 and event1.
- Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event1 happens"" (both occur in the same state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state both event4 and event1 occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules and the initial state:
- Initially event4 happened (call this state s0).
- After event4, the next event must be either event2 or event3 (so s1 ∈ {event2, event3}).

Step 3 — check whether C1 can hold in the next state:
- C1 requires both event4 and event1 to hold in s1. But s1 cannot be event4 (rules forbid event4 immediately after event4) and cannot be event1 (event1 only can appear after event3, i.e., one step after a state that is event3).
- Therefore s1 cannot satisfy ""event4 and event1"".

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 = (C1 holds) or (event1 happens).
- Since C1 = (event2 happens AND event1 happens), C2 simplifies to event1 happens (because (A AND B) OR B ≡ B).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Because event4 happened initially and that requires event1 to happen afterward, event1 does indeed happen. Therefore C2 is True.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event2 happens) AND (event1 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens). Logical simplification: C2 ≡ event1 happens (because A OR (A AND B) ≡ A).

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- Rule: After event4, event1 must happen. That forces event1 to happen.
- Other rules (after event1 → either event3 or event4; after event3 → nothing; after event2 → event4) do not prevent event1 from happening.

Step 3 — Conclusion:
- Since event1 must happen, C2 (which is equivalent to “event1 happens”) is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" So C2 is true iff either (a) C1 is true (event2 and event1 both happen) or (b) event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event1 must happen. (So event1 follows the initial event4 — event1 happens.)
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- From the first two rules, event1 necessarily happens (because event4 happened initially and that forces event1).
- Event2 is not required by any rule; it may or may not occur in some possible sequence, so C1 (which requires event2 and event1) is not guaranteed.
- However, C2 only needs event1 to hold (the second disjunct), and event1 does hold.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We must decide whether ""eventually it becomes true that event3 always happens"" (C2) follows from the rules.

For C1 (""event3 always happens"") to hold at some time t, the event at t and at every later time must be event3. But the rules say: after event3 the next event must be either event2 or event4 — it cannot be event3. So you cannot have two consecutive event3 occurrences, hence you cannot have event3 at every time from some point onward. Therefore C1 can never hold at any time, so ""C1 eventually holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 says ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step the event is 3).
- C2 says ""Eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., from some time onward, every event is 3).
- Look at the transition rules: after event3 the next event must be either event2 or event4. There is no transition 3 -> 3.
- If C1 were to hold from some time t onward, then the event at time t would be 3 and the event at time t+1 would also have to be 3. That requires a 3 -> 3 transition, which does not exist.
- Therefore it is impossible for there to be a suffix of the execution where every event is 3. So C1 can never hold, and hence C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") means from some moment onward every event is event3. For C2 to be true we would need that eventually the system reaches a point after which only event3 occurs.
- From the transition rules, after event3 the next event must be 2 or 4 (there is no self-loop 3 -> 3). So it is impossible to have every future event equal to 3; C1 can never hold at any point.
- Concretely, starting from the initial event2 we can choose the trace 2 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... which avoids event3 forever. This shows there is no inevitability of reaching a suffix of all-3 events.
Therefore C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: (event4 → event1) — ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens"" (a property about a single state).
- C2: X(C1) — ""C1 holds in the next state.""
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event4 happened (so in the initial state event4 is true and event1 is false).
- After event4, no other events can happen (so there is a next state but it has no events occurring).
- The other rules (after event1 → one of event2/event3/event4, after event2 → nothing, after event3 → event4) don’t get exercised because event1 never occurs in the initial run.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Timeline: initial state: event4 happened (only event). Next state: no events happen (the system is terminal/no events enabled).
- Evaluate C1 in the next state: C1 is the implication ""if event4 happens, then event1 happens."" In the next state event4 does not happen, so the antecedent is false, hence the implication is true (vacuously true) in that next state.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is true in the next state, so C2 (X(C1)) is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event4 happens and no other events can happen afterward.
- C1 is the proposition ""if event4 happens, then event1 happens."" In the initial state C1 is false (event4 happened but event1 did not).
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state. The next state exists but, by the rules, no events occur there, so ""event4 happens"" is false in that next state.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true, so ""if event4 happens then event1 happens"" is vacuously true in the next state.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must decide True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen (there is no successor state after the initial state).
- The other rules (after event1 ...) are irrelevant because event1 never occurs in the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- In the initial state event4 happens but event1 does not (no further events occur). So C1 (""if event4 then event1"") is false in the initial state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"")
- There is no next state (after event4 no further events/transitions). A claim that something holds ""in the next state"" cannot be true when no next state exists. Therefore C2 is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""If event3 eventually happens then event1 happens"") follows from the given conditions.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

From ""initially event4"" and ""after event4, either event2 or event3 must happen"" we have two possible valid sequences:

1) event4 → event3. Here event3 does happen, and because event3 is terminal no other events (including event1) occur. This is a valid run where C1 holds but event1 does not happen.

2) event4 → event2 → event3. Again event3 happens while event1 never occurred.

Either sequence is consistent with the rules and provides a counterexample to C2 (C1 can hold without event1 happening). Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Goal: evaluate C2: ""If C1 holds (event3 eventually happens), then event1 happens.""

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules allow, after event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- One valid sequence is: event4 → event3. This satisfies the rule ""after event4, either event2 or event3"" and then ""after event3, no other events can happen.""
- In that sequence event3 does happen (so C1 holds) but event1 never happened.
- Therefore C1 can be true while event1 is false, so the implication ""if C1 then event1"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C2 asks:
C2 states: ""If event3 eventually happens (C1), then event1 happens."" We must decide whether that implication always holds under the given rules.

Step 2 — given rules (summary):
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine possible sequences:
- Sequence A: event4 → event3. This is allowed (after event4, event3 may happen). Here event3 does happen, but event1 never occurred.
- Sequence B: event4 → event2 → event3. This is also allowed (after event4 event2 may happen; after event2 event3 must happen). Again event3 occurs without event1.

Both sequences satisfy C1 (event3 happens) but do not include event1. Therefore C1 can hold while event1 does not happen.

C2 is False."

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every valid sequence, Event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event3 happened.
- After Event3, Event4 must happen.
- After Event4, Event1 must happen.
- After Event1, no other events can happen.
- (After Event2, Event4 must happen — irrelevant unless Event2 occurs.)

Step 3 — Trace the required sequence:
- Since Event3 happened initially, Event4 must occur.
- Once Event4 occurs, Event1 must occur.
- Therefore Event1 will occur in every valid sequence consistent with the constraints.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in all valid sequences.
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 says: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2 says: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., it is always true that Event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs in the given start).

Step 3 — trace the required sequence:
- Since event3 has happened, event4 must happen.
- Once event4 happens, event1 must happen.
- Therefore event1 will happen (it is forced by the chain starting from the initial event3).

Step 4 — conclusion about the hypothesis:
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false because event1 must happen.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all executions, Event1 never happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen (so event4 will occur).
- After event4, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after event4).
- After event1, no other events can happen (this only stops further events but doesn't prevent event1).
- After event2, event4 must happen (irrelevant here).

Step 3 — trace the forced sequence:
- event3 occurred → therefore event4 must occur → therefore event1 must occur.

Thus event1 does happen in the required sequence, so C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" — a property about a single step from some state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state at which the next state has event4.

Examine the rules (with states as a sequence of single events):
- Initial event is event3.
- From event3 the next event must be event2 or event4.
- From event4 the next event must be event1 (then terminal).
- From event2 the next event must be event1 or event3.
- From event1 no further events can happen (terminal).

Trace possible runs from the initial event3:
- One run: event3 → event4 → event1 (terminal). Here C1 holds at the initial state (the next state is event4), so C2 holds on this run.
- Another run: event3 → event2 → event1 (terminal). Here no state has its next state = event4, so C1 never holds on this run.
- Another run: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ... forever, alternating event2 and event3. Here event4 never occurs, so C1 never holds.

Because there exist valid runs consistent with the rules in which event4 never appears as the next state, C1 does not inevitably occur at some future point. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
First, clarify the statements:

- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e., at some state, the immediate next event is event4.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future point there is a state whose next event is event4.)

Now examine the conditions and trace possible runs:

- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3 the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- After event2 the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event1 no further events can happen (terminates).
- After event4 the next event must be event1 (so event4 is followed by event1).

We can build a valid sequence that avoids event4 entirely: choose event2 after the initial event3, and then choose event1 after event2. Sequence: event3 → event2 → event1 and then stop. In that run there is never a state whose next event is event4, so C1 never holds and therefore C2 does not hold on that run.

Since C2 is not guaranteed by the conditions (there exists a valid run where C2 is false), C2 is False.
---
We ask whether ""C1 eventually holds"" is guaranteed by the rules.

Summary of rules:
- Initially event3.
- After event3: either event2 or event4.
- After event2: either event1 or event3.
- After event1: no further events (termination).
- After event4: event1 (and then termination).

Counterexample trace showing C2 can fail:
- Start with event3 (given).
- From event3 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event3 (allowed).
- Repeat: 3,2,3,2,3,2,... forever.

This infinite trace obeys all constraints and never produces event4, so C1 (event4 happens in the next state) never becomes true at any point. Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Step-by-step:
- C1 asserts that event2 occurs in every possible run.
- The context says ""Initially, event4 happened"" and ""After event4, no other events can happen.""
- That gives a valid run consisting only of the initial event4 and then termination; in that run event2 does not occur.
- Because there exists a valid run where event2 does not happen, C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False. C1 states: ""Event2 always happens."" So C2 asserts that event2 always happens.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules say: ""After event4, no other events can happen."" So the run stops immediately after the initial event4.
- Therefore there is at least one valid execution (the initial one) in which event2 does not occur at all.
- That means C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., it is always true that Event2 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
(Other rules about what follows event1, event2, and event3 are irrelevant if no events can follow event4.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s)
- Starting state: event4 has happened.
- Because after event4 no other events can happen, the run ends immediately with only event4 having occurred.
- In this run Event2 does not occur.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false (we have a valid run where Event2 does not happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2 happened.
- After event2, event4 must happen. So next is event4.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So we return to event2.
- That yields an unavoidable infinite 2 ↔ 4 cycle (2,4,2,4,...).
- No rule allows leaving that cycle to reach event1 (the only ways to get to event1 are after event3, or if it happened initially, neither of which holds).
- Therefore event1 does not always happen (C1 is false), so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" So C2 is claiming that Event1 always happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- 4 -> 2 (after event4, event2 must happen)
- 2 -> 4 (after event2, event4 must happen)
- 1 -> (2 or 3 or 4)
- 3 -> (1 or 2)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the start
- We start at event2. By 2 -> 4, the next event must be 4.
- From 4, by 4 -> 2, the next event must be 2.
- So the system is forced into an alternating 2,4,2,4,... loop.
- No rule allows any other event (1 or 3) to occur after 2 or after 4, so neither event1 nor event3 can ever appear starting from the initial event2.

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- Event1 does not always happen (in fact it never happens in the required evolution from the given start).
- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 is ""Event1 always happens.""

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- From the rules: after event2, event4 must happen; after event4, event2 must happen. Those are mandatory, so starting from event2 the system is forced into the infinite alternation 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ...
- There is no rule that allows a transition from event2 or event4 to event1 (or to event3). The only rules mentioning event1 are what must follow if event1 or event3 happens, but nothing forces or enables event1 to occur from the current cycle.
- Therefore event1 never occurs in any continuation starting from the given initial condition, so C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in all possible sequences, both event1 and event2 occur).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- Other rules govern what must follow event2, event3, event4, but they never force an event before the initial event1.

Reasoning through sequences:
- Because initially event1 has happened and after event1 no other events can happen, a valid sequence is: event1 occurs and then nothing else.
- In that sequence event2 never happens, so C1 (both event1 and event2 happen) is false in that possible timeline.

Conclusion:
- Since there is a possible (and valid) sequence where C1 does not hold, C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Let's reason step by step.

- Initially, event1 has happened.
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" makes event1 terminal: once event1 has occurred, the sequence ends and no further events can occur.
- C1 requires both event1 and event2 to happen. Given event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- There is no statement that event2 has already happened initially, so there is no way to guarantee event2 occurs in any execution.
- Therefore C1 does not hold (and certainly does not always hold).

Final answer: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret C1/C2:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., one step after the initial state).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" (so C2 requires C1 to be true).

Step 2 — apply the rules from the initial condition:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen next. Therefore the immediate next state must be event1 or event4 — it cannot be event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
- Because the next state after the initial event3 must be event1 or event4, C1 (event2 happens next) is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires C1 to be true. Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event2 can occur later if we pick event4 then event2, that does not make C1 true).

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The initial event is event3.
- From the rule ""after event3, either event1 or event4 must happen,"" the very next state must be event1 or event4. Event2 cannot be the immediate next state.
- C1 asserts ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — that contradicts the rule above, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false (even if event2 might occur later, C1 does not hold).
Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e., immediately after the initial state)
   - C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (so C2 requires C1 to be true)

2. From the context, initially event3 happened. The rule ""After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen"" fixes the next state to be either event1 or event4 — not event2.

3. Therefore, event2 cannot occur in the immediate next state after the initial event3. So C1 is false.

4. Since C2 requires C1 to be true, C2 is false as well.

Hence C2 is False."

Step 1 — interpret:
- Initially event2 happened. ""Next state"" means the immediate event following that initial event2.
- C1 = ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2 = ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" ≡ ""Event1 happens next or Event4 happens next.""

Step 2 — apply the rules:
- The rule ""After event2, either event1, or event4 must happen"" applies directly to the initial event2.

Step 3 — conclude:
- From initial event2, the next event must be either event1 or event4. Therefore the disjunction ""event1 next OR event4 next"" is guaranteed.

- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds (i.e., Event1 happens or Event4 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — apply the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, either event1 or event4 must happen (i.e., in the next state one of those occurs).

Step 3 — conclude:
- From the rule and the initial event2, in the next state either event1 or event4 must hold.
- That exactly matches C2 (Event1 or Event4 next).

Final answer: True

- Rule: after event2, either event1 or event4 must happen next.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is simply “event2 happens” (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 states that C1 always holds (i.e., at every point in the execution, event2 is true).
- But initially event3 happened. At that initial moment event2 does not hold, so C1 is already false at the start.
- Therefore C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the conjunction ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to simply ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution from the given initial condition, Event2 will occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially: event3 has happened.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: event2 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2: event3 must happen (and that repeats).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event3 you must go to either 1 or 4.
  - If you go 3 → 1, then 1 → 2 (so event2 happens).
  - If you go 3 → 4, then 4 → 1 or 4 → 2.
    - If 4 → 1, then 1 → 2 (so event2 happens).
    - If 4 → 2, event2 happens immediately.
- After any occurrence of event2 you go to 3 and the same choices repeat, so event2 will keep occurring forever in every run.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In every possible execution starting from the given initial condition, event2 must occur (indeed, infinitely often). Therefore C1 holds in all executions, so the statement ""C1 always holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3 the rules force either event1 or event4 next.
  - If event1 happens, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2.
  - If event4 happens, the rule ""after event4, either event1 or event2 must happen"":
    - if it chooses event2, event2 occurs immediately;
    - if it chooses event1, then by the rule after event1 event2 must happen next.
- So in every possible branch from the initial event3, event2 will occur (in at most two steps).
- After event2, the system returns to event3 and the same reasoning repeats, so event2 occurs in every execution (indeed infinitely often).

Therefore C1 (event2 happens) holds in all executions, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- The context states: ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means at the initial point in time event3 has already occurred.

Step 3 — Reason about ""eventually"":
- ""Eventually"" is satisfied if the event holds at some point now or in the future. Since event3 already happened initially, C1 is true immediately.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds, so C2 (its negation) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the initial condition
- The context says ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means at the starting point event3 has already occurred.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- If ""eventually happens"" is interpreted in the usual way (true at the current or some future point), then event3 has already happened, so C1 is true.

(If someone insisted ""eventually"" means strictly in the future after the initial point, note there exist execution choices that avoid returning to event3 forever — e.g. event3 → event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → … — so event3 would not be guaranteed in the future. But that does not change that event3 did occur initially.)

Conclusion
- Since C1 is true (event3 has already happened), C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not eventually happen).

- Therefore C1 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event4 always happens.""

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences from the initial event3
- From the initial event3 the next event must be either event1 or event2.
  - If event1 happens next: because event1 is terminal, no further events occur. In this branch, event2 does not happen and event4 does not happen.
  - If event2 happens next: then event3 must happen afterward (by the rule after event2). That returns to a state after event3, which again forces either event1 or event2, etc. In these branches event2 may happen and event4 might or might not occur depending on choices, but they are not forced in every branch.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires that event2 happens and that event4 always happens in all possible sequences.
- The branch where after the initial event3 we choose event1 shows a valid sequence where event2 never happens and event4 never happens.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (it is false that both parts hold in all cases).

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 asserts (Event2 happens) AND (C1 holds). C1 asserts Event4 always happens.

Now examine the conditions and trace possibilities from the initial state:

- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- If event1 happens, then ""no other events can happen"" — the sequence ends there.

Take the allowed sequence: initial event3 → event1. This sequence is consistent with all given rules. In that sequence:
- Event2 does not happen.
- Event4 does not happen.

Therefore C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false (we have a valid run without event4), and thus C2 (which requires C1 and also event2) is false.

Final answer: False
---
You are asking whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context. C1 is ""Event4 always happens.""

Examine the rules and trace possible event sequences:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - If event1 happens next, then ""after event1, no other events can happen."" The sequence stops and event4 does not occur. This is a valid run that violates C1.
  - If event2 happens next, then ""after event2, event3 must happen,"" so you get event3 → event2 → event3 → ... or eventually choose event1 and stop. In these runs event4 is never forced (and may never occur).

Because there is a valid sequence (initial event3 then event1) in which event4 does not happen, C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false. C2 requires C1 to hold, so C2 is false as well.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis: C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., immediately after the initial state).

- From the conditions:
  - Initially event1 occurs.
  - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (next).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (next).
  - After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (next).
  - After event4, event2 must happen (next).

- Consider the possible next-state choices. One allowed next-state is event2. If the next state is event2, the rules force the following state to be event1, and from event1 we can again choose event2, and so on. This yields an infinite loop: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... where event4 never occurs.

- Because there is a reachable next state in which event2 happens but event4 does not (and need not ever occur), the implication ""if event2 happens then event4 happens"" does not hold in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened. After event1 the next state must be either event2 or event3.
- C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens"" (i.e., event2 ⇒ event4, interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs, event4 must follow).
- Consider the next-state possibility where event2 happens immediately. From the rules: event2 → event1 → (either event2 or event3). That permits a run that loops between event2 and event1 indefinitely (always choosing event2 after event1), never reaching event4. So event2 does not guarantee event4.
- Because in that possible next state C1 is false, the claim ""C1 holds in the next state"" (C2) is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- After event1, the next state can be either event2 or event3 (both allowed by the rules).
- C2 asserts that C1 (""if event2 then event4"") holds in the next state.
- If the next state is event2, C1 would require event4 to also happen in that same state. But the rules only require that after event2, event1 must happen — nothing forces event4 to occur. So there is a possible next state (event2) in which C1 is false.
- Because C1 does not hold in all possible next states, C2 is false."

- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state."" C2 = ""Eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., at some future point event1 occurs in the next state).

- Initial condition: event3 happened.

- Constraints:
  - After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
  - After event2, event4 must happen next.
  - After event4, event2 must happen next.
  - (After event1 would force either event2 or event4 next, but that only constrains what follows event1.)

- Trace from the initial state:
  - From event3 the next state is either event2 or event4.
  - If event2 happens, the next state must be event4.
  - If event4 happens, the next state must be event2.
  - Thus once we move from the initial event3, the system is forced into an alternating cycle of event2 and event4 forever.

- Conclusion: There is no transition that allows event1 to ever occur (every possible next state after the initial event3, and after those, is either event2 or event4). Therefore C1 never becomes true, so C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" — i.e. at some time t, event1 occurs in the following state.
- Initially event3 occurs (time 0). The rule ""After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen"" forces time 1 to be either event2 or event4.
- If time 1 = event2, then ""After event2, event4 must happen"" forces time 2 = event4; then ""After event4, event2 must happen"" forces time 3 = event2, and so on, producing an infinite alternation 2,4,2,4,...
- If time 1 = event4 the same alternation follows (4,2,4,2,...).
- In either case, once the system leaves the initial event3 it is forced into the 2–4 loop and no rule allows event1 to occur at any next step. The rule about ""after event1"" only constrains what happens if event1 occurs; it does not force event1 ever to occur.
- Therefore C1 never holds at any time, so ""eventually C1"" (C2) is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (a property about some particular step).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some future point there is a step whose next state has event1.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially event3 occurred.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2, event4 must happen next.
- After event4, event2 must happen next.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state:
- From the initial event3 the next event must be event2 or event4.
- If event2 occurs, the rule forces event4 next, and then event2, and so on: an infinite alternation ...2,4,2,4,...
- If event4 occurs, the rule forces event2 next, and then event4, etc.: again the same infinite alternation.
- None of these allowed transitions ever permit event1 to occur (after 2 or 4 the next is fixed to 4 or 2, not 1; after 3 the choices were 2 or 4, not 1).

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Event1 never occurs in any reachable next state, so C1 never holds at any time, hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 states: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""
- C1 states: ""Event1 always happens.""

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event4 occurred.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: event1 must happen.
- (The rule about event2 is repeated; that does not add new constraints.)

Step 3 — look for a counterexample to ""event1 always happens"":
- From the initial event4, choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2, choose event4 (allowed).
- Repeat: event4 → event2 → event4 → event2 → ...
This infinite loop never requires event1. Therefore there exists a valid sequence in which event1 never happens, so C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires C1 to hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is false (regardless of whether event1 can happen in some runs).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (i.e., C1 ∧ event1).

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: event1 must happen.
(No rule forces event3 to ever occur.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- From the initial event4 we may choose event2 next.
- From event2 we may choose event4 next.
- From event4 we may again choose event2, and so on.
This yields an infinite sequence: event4 → event2 → event4 → event2 → ... in which event1 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclude:
- Because there is a valid sequence where event1 never happens, C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 ∧ event1) is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- If we always choose event2 after event4, and then from event2 choose event4 (both choices allowed), we can form an infinite sequence: event4 → event2 → event4 → event2 → ... never producing event1.
- That sequence is compatible with all given rules, so event1 is not guaranteed to always happen. Therefore C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- C2 asserts C1 holds (event1 always happens) and event1 happens; since C1 is false, C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event4 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason through implications
- Because event4 happened initially and ""after event4 no other events can happen,"" no event can occur after that initial event4.
- C1 asserts that if event4 happens then event3 happens. But since event4 already happens and no events can occur after it, event3 cannot happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event2 to happen. Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false regardless of whether event2 could happen (and in fact event2 cannot occur after the initial event4 either).

Final answer
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Context says initially event4 happened.
- Also: after event4, no other events can happen. So the sequence stops at event4; neither event3 nor event2 can occur afterward (and there is no prior event3 or event2 given).
- C1 is ""if event4 happens, then event3 happens."" The antecedent (event4) is true, but the consequent (event3) is false (no event3 occurs). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event2 to happen. Since C1 is false (and event2 does not occur), C2 is false.
---
Goal: determine whether C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The context states ""Initially, event4 happened.""
- Also: ""After event4, no other events can happen."" Therefore nothing can occur after that initial event4.
- C1 says ""If event4 happens, then event3 happens."" Given the actual sequence, event4 did happen but no other events (including event3) can happen afterward, and there were no prior events (event4 was initial). So event3 does not occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires both C1 to hold and event2 to happen. Event2 does not happen (no events can follow the initial event4), and C1 is already false. So C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event4 occurs at state0.
- From event4, the next state (state1) must be either event1 or event3. So event4 cannot occur in state1; C1 (""event4 happens in the next state"" from state0) is false.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — that is, in state1 it must be true that event4 occurs in state2. This requires that for every allowed choice at state1, state2 be event4.
- But if state1 = event3 (allowed), then by the rule after event3 the next state2 must be event2, not event4 — so C1 is false in that branch.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context (there is a permitted trace making it false). Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially (time 0) event4 happened.
- From event4, at time1 either event1 or event3 must occur.
- C1 is the proposition ""event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time1).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — equivalently, at time1 it is true that event4 happens at time2.
- Consider the two possible time1 cases:
  - If time1 = event3, then at time2 event2 must happen (so event4 at time2 is impossible). Thus C1 is false at time1 in this branch.
  - If time1 = event1, then at time2 either event2 or event4 may happen; event4 is not guaranteed. So C1 is not guaranteed at time1 in this branch either.
- Because there is at least one allowed branch (in fact both branches fail to guarantee) where C1 does not hold at time1, C2 is not entailed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step‑by‑step:

- Let time 0 be the initial state: event4 happened.
- The rule after event4: at time1 either event1 or event3 must happen.

Consider the two possible branches at time1:
1. If time1 = event1, then the rule after event1 allows time2 to be event2 or event4. In this branch, event4 at time2 (which is what C2 asserts) is possible.
2. If time1 = event3, then the rule after event3 requires time2 = event2. In this branch event4 does not occur at time2, so C2 is false.

C2 asserts that in the next state (time1) the statement C1 holds (i.e., that event4 will happen at time2). Because there is a valid branch (time1 = event3) where event4 does not happen at time2, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true. Interpretations:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e. at every point in the future event2 occurs (or equivalently: event2 holds whenever an event happens).
- C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" — i.e. there is some future point from which onward C1 is true.

Use the given rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules involving event2/event3 do not matter once event1 has happened.)

Trace from the start: event4 → (must) event1 → stop (no further events permitted). No occurrence of event2 can ever happen in this trace. Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false in the only possible continuation, and there is no later point from which C1 becomes true. Hence C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 always happens."" C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" (i.e. at some future point, from then on Event2 always happens).
- From the conditions: initially event4 happened. The rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" forces event1 next. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes event1 terminal — no further events occur.
- Therefore no event2 ever occurs in the actual execution (the only possible sequence is event4 → event1 → stop).
- Since Event2 never happens, C1 is false at all times, so it cannot eventually become true. Hence C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event4 occurs.
- Rule: after event4, event1 must happen. So the next event is event1.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen. That ends the sequence (system halts).
- In the actual sequence (event4 → event1) event2 never occurs, so ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Because the system halts after event1 and there is no path that produces event2 thereafter, C1 can never become true at any later time. Hence ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false."

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""Event1 never eventually happens"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens."" C2 = ""Event1 does not eventually happen.""
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event4.
  - If we pick event1 next, event1 does eventually happen (C1 holds).
  - If we pick event4 next, then after event4 event3 must happen, and after that we again must choose event1 or event4. Choosing event4 repeatedly yields the infinite loop ...3,4,3,4,... in which event1 never occurs (C2 holds in that run).
- So there exist executions where event1 occurs and executions where it never occurs.

Conclusion
- C2 is not necessarily true in all executions (it is satisfiable but not entailed). The question asks whether C2 is true given the context — it is not guaranteed, so the correct answer is: False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event1 never happens).

Step 2 — Examine the rules:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences:
- If after the initial event3 we choose event1, then event1 happens and the sequence ends. So C1 can be true.
- Alternatively, after event3 we can choose event4; then by the rule after event4 we get event3, and after that we can again choose event4, etc. Thus the sequence E3, E4, E3, E4, ... can continue forever and avoid event1. So C1 can be false.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- Because there exist executions where event1 happens and executions where it never happens, C1 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed either — it is not entailed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Start: event3 has happened initially.
2. From event3, the rules say either event1 or event4 must happen next.
3. If event1 happens after that event3, then event1 eventually happens (C1 holds). Also event1 is terminal, so that run ends.
4. If event4 happens after event3, the rule “after event4, event3 must happen” forces event3 again, and from that event3 again either event1 or event4 must happen. This allows a run that loops 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... forever, in which event1 never occurs.
5. Therefore there are some allowed executions where event1 eventually happens and some where it never happens.

Conclusion: C1 is not guaranteed but is satisfiable (there exists a run where it holds). C2 asserts “C1 does not hold” (i.e., event1 never happens). Because there is at least one valid run where event1 does happen, C2 is not true.

- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace consequences:
- From the initial event3, event1 must occur next — so C1 is satisfied (event1 does happen).
- From event1 we get event4, and from event4 we get event1 again; this makes a cycle between event1 and event4.
- There is no rule that after event1 (or after event4) event2 must occur. The only rule involving event2 is that if event2 happens then event4 happens; that does not imply event2 ever must happen.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2:
- C2 asserts that event2 follows whenever event1 holds. The context does not force event2 after event1, so C2 is not guaranteed/entailed.

- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen → so event1 does occur next (C1 is true).
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen (so event1 and event4 can cycle).
- After event2, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- From the initial event3 we get event1 (so C1 holds).
- Event1 forces event4, which forces event1, etc.
- Nothing in the rules forces event2 to occur after event1 (or at all). The only rule involving event2 is that event2 → event4, which does not force event2 from any other event.

Conclusion:
- C2 (""if C1 then event2"") is not entailed by the given rules. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether ""If event1 happens in the next state (C1), then event2 happens (C2)"" is entailed by the given conditions.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: if C1 holds then event2 happens.
We must decide whether the context forces C2 to be true.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen. => From the initial state, event1 is forced next (so C1 holds).
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen. => event1 and event4 can alternate.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
There is no rule saying event1 (or any of the other rules) implies event2.

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence
- Start: event3 (given).
- Next: event1 (forced by after event3).
- Next: event4 (forced by after event1).
- Next: event1 (forced by after event4).
This loop can continue forever without event2 ever occurring.

Step 4 — conclusion
Since there is a valid sequence consistent with all rules where C1 holds but event2 never happens, the statement ""if C1 then event2"" is not entailed by the context.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Hypothesis: C2 asserts that C1 (""event1 happens and event4 happens"") always holds (i.e., in every allowed execution both event1 and event4 occur).

- Given rules and initial state:
  - Initially event3 has happened.
  - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - After event1, event3 must happen.
  - After event2, event3 must happen.
  - After event4, no further events can happen.

- From these rules: once the initial event3 has occurred you are forced into a cycle: event3 → (event1 or event2) → event3 → (event1 or event2) → ... . Every occurrence of event3 requires a next event (1 or 2), and every occurrence of 1 or 2 requires a following event3. Thus at every point there is a required next event; there is no point at which you can validly perform event4 without violating a pending obligation.

- Therefore event4 can never validly occur in any execution consistent with the rules (and so there is no execution in which both event1 and event4 happen). C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens and event4 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible valid run, both event1 and event4 occur).

Step 2 — examine rules:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (choice).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample run:
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose after event3 to do event2. Then by the rule, event3 must follow event2. So we can repeat: 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> ...
- In this run event1 never occurs and event4 never occurs.

Since there exists a valid run where C1 is false, C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:
1. Initially event3 happens.
2. After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2.
3. After event1, event3 must happen; after event2, event3 must happen. So any valid sequence alternates: 3 → (1 or 2) → 3 → (1 or 2) → ...
4. There is no rule allowing event4 to follow any event, and event4 is not the initial event. Since no transition produces event4, event4 can never occur in any allowed sequence.
5. C1 requires both event1 and event4 to happen. Because event4 cannot happen, C1 cannot hold, so it certainly does not ""always hold.""

False"

Sample responses:
Let's identify what's being asked:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., from a given state, every future step contains event1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., at the state immediately after the initial one, C1 is true)

Given rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen (irrelevant unless event3 occurs).

Trace possible futures from the initial state (where event2 just occurred):
- From this state the next event can be event1 or event4.
- If you pick event4, then by rules you get event2, and from event2 you can again pick event4. So there is a valid infinite sequence: event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → ... that never contains event1.

Therefore event1 is not guaranteed to occur in all futures from the next state, so C1 does not hold in the next state. Hence C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e. at every future step event1 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. starting at the next state, event1 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the given rules:
- Initially event2.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen (irrelevant here unless 3 occurs).

Step 3 — produce a counterexample:
- From the initial event2, choose event4 next (allowed by the rule ""after event2 either event1 or event4"").
- Then after event4 we must have event2, then again choose event4, etc.
- This yields the infinite sequence 2,4,2,4,2,4,... in which event1 never occurs.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false (there is a valid run with no event1).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpretations:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means on every future step (in all states along a trace) event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means that starting from the state immediately after the initial one, C1 is true (i.e., from that point onward event1 always happens).

2. Use the given rules to build a counterexample trace:
- Initially: event2 happened.
- After event2, the rule allows either event1 or event4.
- Choose event4. After event4, the rule requires event2.
- After that event2 we can again choose event4, then event2, and so on.

Thus one valid infinite trace is: event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → ... This trace never contains event1.

3. Conclusions:
- Because there is a valid trace with no occurrences of event1, C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- In the next state (immediately after the initial event2), the same choices remain, so the same counterexample starting there (choose event4, then event2, etc.) shows C1 does not hold from the next state either. Therefore C2 is false.

Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 asserts that ""C1 always holds."" C1 is the statement ""Event4 happens or Event1 happens."" So C2 claims that at every point in the execution, either Event4 happens at that point or Event1 happens at that point.

Step 2 — restate the context as a forced trace
- Initially Event1 happens (so at the first time point Event1 is true).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so the next event is Event2).
- After Event2, no other events can happen (Event2 is terminal).
- The constraints about Event3 and Event4 do not force Event3 or Event4 to ever occur in this scenario.

Thus a valid (and forced) execution is:
1) time 0: Event1 happens
2) time 1: Event2 happens
3) then stop (no further events)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 on that trace
- At time 0, C1 (""Event4 or Event1"") is true because Event1 happens.
- At time 1, Event2 happens; neither Event1 nor Event4 happen at that time, so C1 is false at time 1.
- Since C1 is not true at every point of the trace, ""C1 always holds"" is false.

Conclusion
C2 is False.

Answer: True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. What the hypothesis asks: C1 is the statement ""Event4 happens or Event1 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible execution/trace consistent with the rules, C1 is true).

2. Use the given conditions:
   - ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means in every execution/event trace Event1 has already occurred.
   - Other rules constrain what can happen later, but none can undo the fact that Event1 happened initially.

3. Therefore in every possible execution at least Event1 has happened, so the disjunction ""Event4 or Event1"" is true in every execution (it may be true because of Event1 even if Event4 never occurs).

4. Conclusion: C1 holds in all executions, so C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event3 happens).
- C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event3 happens). Note C2 simplifies to just (event3 happens) because (A or B) and B = B.

Step 2 — examine the conditions (given rules and initial fact):
- Initially event4 happened.
- event3 -> event4 (if event3 happens then event4 must happen).
- event4 -> event2.
- event2 -> event4.
- event1 -> event4.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- From initial event4 we can infer event2 (by event4 -> event2), and then event4 again (by event2 -> event4). So event4 and event2 hold.
- There is no rule that implies event3 from event4, event2, or event1. Nothing forces event1 or event3 to occur.
- Since event3 is not entailed by the given facts and rules, C2 (which is equivalent to event3) is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C2 means
- C1 is ""event1 or event3"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 holds"", i.e. (event1 ∨ event3) ∧ event3.
- That simplifies to just event3 (because event3 ∧ (event1 ∨ event3) ≡ event3).

Step 2 — what the context implies
- Initially event4 happened.
- Rules:
  - after event4 → event2
  - after event2 → event4
  - after event3 → event4
  - after event1 → event4
- From the initial event4 we must have event2, then event4, then event2, ... — events 4 and 2 occur (possibly repeatedly).
- Nothing in the rules produces or requires event1 or event3 to occur.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Event3 is not entailed by the given facts and rules. It may be possible but is not forced.
- Since C2 is equivalent to event3 and event3 is not guaranteed, C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (event3 happens). Note that C2 is equivalent to just (event3 happens) (because if event3 holds, C1 automatically holds).

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- event3 → event4 (after event3, event4 must happen).
- event4 → event2 (after event4, event2 must happen).
- event2 → event4 (after event2, event4 must happen).
- event1 → event4 (after event1, event4 must happen).

Step 3 — trace what can be derived:
- From the initial event4 and the rules, we can derive event2 (from event4 → event2) and then event4 again (from event2 → event4), producing a loop between event4 and event2.
- There is no rule that produces event3 or event1 from any of the given events. Neither event1 nor event3 is implied by the context.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires event3 to hold. The context does not entail event3, so C2 cannot be concluded as true.

We start with event4 (given). After event4, the rules require either event1 or event2. C1 says event1 does not happen, so the only possible choice after the initial event4 is event2. After event2, the rules require event3. Therefore if C1 holds, event3 must occur. So C2 is True.

Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event3 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the conditions.

Examine the conditions and trace sequences:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- If event1 does not happen (C1), then after event4 the only remaining option is event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal).

Therefore, under C1 (event1 never happens), the sequence is forced: event4 → event2 → event3, so event3 does indeed happen.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: Event1 does not happen (i.e., event1 is excluded).
- C2: If C1 holds, then event3 happens (we must check whether event3 necessarily occurs whenever event1 does not).

Step 2 — use the given rules starting from the initial event:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen. If C1 holds (event1 does not happen), the only option after event4 is event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3 no further events occur (terminal).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""event3 does not happen"" = ¬event3.
- C2 = ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" = event1 ∨ ¬event3.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 is true.
- event4 → event2.
- event2 → (event1 ∨ event3 ∨ event4).
- event1 → (event2 ∨ event3 ∨ event4).
- event3 → (event1 ∨ event2). (given twice, same constraint)

Step 3 — reason about consequences:
- Since event3 is initially true, ¬event3 is false, so C2 reduces to event1.
- From event3 → (event1 ∨ event2), either event1 or event2 must occur. But it is consistent to choose event2 (and not event1).
- If event2 occurs and event1 does not, event2 → (event1 ∨ event3 ∨ event4) is satisfied by event3 (which is true). All other implications are satisfied (implications with false antecedents are vacuously true).

Thus there is a model satisfying all given conditions where event1 is false and ¬event3 is false, so C2 (event1 ∨ ¬event3) is false in that model. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true.

- 3 → (1 ∨ 2)
- 2 → (1 ∨ 3 ∨ 4)
- 4 → 2
(One 3→(1 ∨ 2) rule was repeated; it adds nothing new.)

- Start: 3 (given).
- After 3 choose 2 (allowed by 3 → (1 ∨ 2)).
- After 2 choose 4 (allowed by 2 → (1 ∨ 3 ∨ 4)).
- After 4, rule 4 → 2 forces 2 again.
- Repeat 2 → 4 → 2 indefinitely.

This sequence satisfies all rules and never includes event1. Therefore event1 is not guaranteed to happen.

Conclusion:
C2 is not entailed by the context, so the correct answer is: False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds.
Given the context, initially event3 happened, so C1 is false. Therefore C2 simplifies to: Event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2: either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event4: event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — construct a valid trace with no Event1
- Start: event3 (given).
- From event3 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 must go to event2.
- Repeat event2 → event4 → event2 … indefinitely.

This trace respects all rules and never includes event1. Since C1 is false (event3 did happen) and event1 can be avoided, C2 is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens (some time in the future).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., from the state immediately after the initial one, Event1 will eventually happen on all continuations).

Examine the rules (possible next events):
- Initially: event4 occurred.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: event2 must happen.

Trace possibilities from the initial event4:
- If the next event is event1, then C1 holds on that continuation.
- But if the next event is event2, then from event2 one may choose event4, and from that event4 again choose event2, etc. This yields an infinite sequence:
  event4 (initial) → event2 → event4 → event2 → ...
  which never includes event1.

Because there exists a valid continuation from the next state that never reaches event1, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says “Event1 eventually happens” (i.e., in all possible continuations from a state, event1 will occur at some future point).
- Initially event4 happened. The rules say after event4 the next event must be either event1 or event2.
- C2 asserts that in the next state (one step after the initial event4) C1 holds.
- But if the next state is event2 (allowed), the system can then choose event4 (allowed), then event2, then event4, ad infinitum (2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ...). This infinite loop never produces event1.
- Therefore there is a reachable next state (event2) from which event1 is not inevitable, so C1 does not hold in that next state.

Thus C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 occurs.
- After event4 the next state may be event1 or event2 (nondeterministic choice).
- C2 asserts that ""event1 eventually happens"" holds from that next state for all possible continuations.
- But there is a valid continuation avoiding event1 forever: choose next = event2, then from event2 choose event4, then from event4 choose event2, etc. This yields the infinite trace event4 → event2 → event4 → event2 → ... with no event1.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed in the next state, so C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 says: ""Event3 happens and event4 happens, and event1 happens."" So we must check whether there is a sequence consistent with the rules in which events 4, 1, and 3 all occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event4 occurred.
- After event4, next must be event1 or event2.
- After event1, next must be event2 or event3.
- After event2, next must be event1 or event3.
- After event3, next must be event2 or event4.

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence that satisfies C2:
- Start: event4 (given).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed).
This yields the sequence 4 → 1 → 3, in which event4, event1, and event3 all occur.

Conclusion:
- C2 can be satisfied by a valid sequence, so the hypothesis C2 is True.
---
The hypothesis C2 asserts that event4, event3, and event1 all happen.

From the context: event4 happens initially. After each event there is a nondeterministic choice:
- after event4: event1 or event2
- after event1: event2 or event3
- after event2: event1 or event3
- after event3: event2 or event4

C2 is consistent with the rules (e.g. event4 → event1 → event3), so it is possible. But it is not guaranteed: for example, choose event4 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... and never choose event3, so event3 never happens and C2 fails.

Since C2 does not necessarily follow from the context, the correct answer is:
False
---
You're asking whether C2 (event4 and event3 and event1 all happen) must be true given the context rules.

Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C2 requires event4, event3, and event1 to occur.

Step 2 — relevant rules (summarized):
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — check whether C2 is forced:
- From event4 we may choose event1 or event2. From event1 we may choose event2 (not necessarily event3). From event2 we may choose event1 (not necessarily event3). So there are valid sequences that never produce event3, e.g.:
  event4 -> event1 -> event2 -> event1 -> event2 -> ...
  This sequence respects all ""either/or"" requirements but never produces event3. It does include event4 and event1 but not event3, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

You're asking whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the rules.

Interpretation: C1 is the proposition ""event3 happens or event2 happens"" at the current moment. C2 asserts that this proposition holds at every moment (i.e., it is an invariant).

Step-by-step reasoning
- Initially event4 happened. At that moment neither event2 nor event3 is happening, so C1 is false right away.
- Because C1 fails at the initial moment, it cannot be true at all times.
- (As further support: sequences allowed by the rules include 4 → 3 → 1 → …; at the moment 1 occurs, again neither 2 nor 3 holds, so C1 fails there too.)

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C1 is the statement ""Event3 happens or Event2 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., at every step in every possible execution, either event3 or event2 occurs).
- From the rules we have the allowed transitions: 4 → 3 (only), 3 → {1,2}, 1 → {2,3}, 2 → 4 (only). The system starts with event4 having happened, so the next event must be 3.
- But from 3 we are allowed to take 3 → 1. That yields the prefix 4 → 3 → 1. At the step where event1 happens, neither event2 nor event3 occurs, so C1 is false at that step.
- Because there is a possible execution in which C1 fails, C1 is not always true.

Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 asserts: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.  
- After event1, event4 must happen. (So the immediate next event after event1 is event4.)  
- After event4, no other events can happen. (event4 is terminal.)  
- Other rules (after event2 → event3 or event4; after event3 → event2) are irrelevant unless event2 or event3 occurs, but they cannot override the mandatory after-event1 → event4.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event1 happened initially, the next event must be event4 (by the rule).  
- Therefore the next state contains event4, not event3. Event3 does not happen in the next state.  
- Thus C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false. Event1 did happen, so the first conjunct of C2 is true, but C2 is a conjunction and one conjunct is false.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

Step 1 — what hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event3 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:

- After event1, event4 must happen. (So the immediate next event after event1 is event4.)
- After event4, no other events can happen. (event4 is terminal.)
- The other rules (about event2↔event3) do not override the deterministic ""after event1, event4 must happen.""

Step 3 — trace:
- From the initial event1, the next state must be event4. Therefore event3 cannot happen in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False

False

Reasoning:
- The context states that initially event1 happened.
- It also states: ""After event1, event4 must happen."" So the immediate next event following event1 must be event4.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time t1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — that means: at time t1, C1 is true, i.e., event1 happens at time t2. So C2 asserts that event1 occurs two steps from now (at t2).

Step 2 — apply the conditions and trace states
- Initially (t0) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen. So at t1 we must have event1. Therefore C1 is true.
- Rule: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. So at t2 we must have either event2 or event3 — event1 at t2 is not required (and in a single-event-per-state model it would be excluded).
- If t2 is event2 then by the rule after event2, event1 will happen at t3; if t2 is event3 then by the rule after event3, event1 will happen at t3. In either case event1 occurs at t3, not necessarily at t2.

Step 3 — conclusion about C2
- C2 asserts event1 at t2. That is not guaranteed by the rules (t2 must be event2 or event3). Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the propositions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (From the current time t0, C1 says event1 occurs at t1.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (From t0, C2 says that at t1 the proposition C1 is true — i.e. event1 occurs at t2.)

Step 2 — apply the context rules starting from the initial state
- Initially (t0) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → therefore at t1 event1 must occur. So C1 is true at t0.
- Rule: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen → therefore at t2 the event must be either event2 or event3 (not event1).
- Neither branch at t2 guarantees event1. Thus C1 does not necessarily hold at t1 (i.e., event1 at t2 is not guaranteed).

Conclusion
- C2 (which requires event1 at t2) is not guaranteed. Answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., event1 at time t+1).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = ""in the next state, event1 happens in that state's next state"" = event1 at time t+2.

Step 2 — use the context rules
- Initially event2 happened (time t).
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen ⇒ event1 at time t+1. So C1 is true now.
- Rule: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen ⇒ at time t+2 it must be event2 or event3 (not event1).
- Rules after event2 or event3 both require event1 afterwards, but that would put event1 at time t+3, not t+2.

Conclusion
- C2 asserts event1 at time t+2, but the rules force time t+2 to be event2 or event3, so C2 is false.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" So C2 is true iff either event3 did not happen, or event4 happens (or both).

- Hence C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.

Step 3 — Can event4 happen?
- The context also says: ""After event3, no other events can happen.""
- Since event3 happened initially, no events can occur after it. That prevents event4 from happening.
- Therefore event4 does not happen.

We are asked about C2: ""Event3 does not happen OR event4 happens.""

1. From the context, event3 happened initially.
2. Therefore C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
3. Thus C2 reduces to ""event4 happens.""
4. But the context also says: after event3, no other events can happen. Since event3 already happened initially, no other events (including event4) can happen.
5. So event4 cannot happen, and C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked
- We must determine whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true or false.
- C1 is ""Event3 always happens.""

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened (so every allowed scenario begins with event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (so the sequence ends immediately after that initial event3).
- Other rules (what happens after event1 or event2) are irrelevant because those events cannot occur given the initial event3 and the rule that nothing follows event3.

Step 3 — Reasoning about C1 and C2
- Because every allowed sequence starts with event3 and then stops, event3 occurs in all possible sequences. So C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C2 is the negation of C1. C1 states “Event3 always happens.”
- The facts say “Initially, event3 happened.” That means every possible execution/trace begins with event3.
- Also, after event3 no other events can happen, so every execution is exactly the single event3 (it halts).
- Therefore in every possible execution event3 occurs (indeed it occurs initially), so C1 holds.
- Since C1 is true, C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning (summary): The scenario states ""Initially, event3 happened."" and also that ""after event3, no other events can happen."" That means every possible execution has event3 (it happened initially) and nothing can prevent it. So ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is true, hence ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e., from the current state, event4 occurs one step later).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning that in the next state, C1 is true. Equivalently, from the current state C2 asserts that event4 happens two steps later (event4 at state +2).

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially (state 0), event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state1 must be event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so state2 must be event1).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 would be terminal).
- After event3, one of event1, event2, or event4 must happen (irrelevant unless event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- State0: event1 (given).
- By the rule after event1, State1 must be event2.
- By the rule after event2, State2 must be event1.
- Thus states alternate event1, event2, event1, event2, ... indefinitely.
- No rule forces event4 at any future step, and event4 is not reachable from the mandatory alternation of 1 and 2 (no rule allows substituting event4 for the required events).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 claims event4 will occur at state2 (two steps from the initial state). But state2 must be event1, not event4.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, event4 happens in its next state — equivalently, event4 happens two steps from now)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the immediate next state is event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the state after that is event1).
- After event3, one of event1, event2, or event4 must happen (but event3 never occurs so this rule does not trigger).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 would be terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequence from the initial state:
- State0: event1 (given).
- State1: must be event2 (by rule after event1).
- State2: must be event1 (by rule after event2).
- State3: must be event2, and so on — the system is forced to alternate 1 and 2 forever.

Event4 can only occur after event3, but event3 never occurs in this forced alternation, so event4 never occurs at any future step.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event4 in the next state) is false (the next state is event2).
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state, i.e., event4 two steps from now) is also false (two steps from now is event1; event4 never occurs).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e., in the immediate successor state s1 of the current state s0).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in s1, C1 is true — equivalently, in s2 (the successor of s1) event4 happens. So C2 asserts event4 happens two steps from now.

Step 2 — apply the constraints starting from the initial situation:
- Initially event1 happened (current state s0 = event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen → s1 = event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → s2 = event1.
- This yields the deterministic alternation s0: event1 → s1: event2 → s2: event1 → s3: event2 → …

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event4 in s1) is false because s1 = event2.
- C2 (event4 in s2) is false because s2 = event1.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2 either event1 or event4 must happen. So two possible branches:
  - If event1 happens, then by the rules event3 must happen next, and then after event3 either event1 or event4, etc.
  - If event4 happens, then event3 must happen next, and after that either event1 or event4, etc.
- It is possible to always choose event4 whenever a choice arises, producing the infinite sequence: event2 → event4 → event3 → event4 → event3 → ...
- In that sequence event1 never occurs, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold and event1 to happen, and there exists a valid run where C1 is false (and event1 never happens), C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens,"" C2 is effectively claiming that event1 must (eventually) occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event2 you may choose event1: 2 → 1 (then 1 → 3 → ...). In this branch event1 does happen.
- But from event2 you could instead choose event4: 2 → 4 → 3. From 3 you must choose either 1 or 4.
- If you repeatedly choose 4 after 3, you get the infinite loop 2 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... and event1 never occurs in that run.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid sequence (the 4↔3 loop) in which event1 never happens, event1 is not guaranteed to eventually occur. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, and C2 (which asserts event1 does occur) is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (i.e., event1 eventually happens and event1 happens).

Understand the rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: event3 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.

Trace possible sequences:
- From the initial event2, one possible next event is event1. If event1 is chosen, then event3 must follow, and then again either event1 or event4, etc. In that branch event1 does occur (so C1 would hold in that trace).
- But from event2 the other allowed next event is event4. If event4 is chosen, event3 must follow, and after event3 the choice between event1 or event4 is again unrestricted. It is therefore possible to always choose event4 after each event3, producing a trace: event2, event4, event3, event4, event3, ... in which event1 never occurs.

Conclusion:
- Event1 is not guaranteed to eventually happen in every allowed execution (there exists a valid execution where event1 never happens). Therefore C1 is not necessarily true, and the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds and event4 happens"") is true given the event rules.
- C1 is: ""Event3 always happens."" So C2 says: event3 is inevitable and event4 also happens.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially: event1 has happened.
- From 1 → {2, 3, 4} (one of 2,3,4 must follow).
- From 2 → 4 (2 is followed by 4).
- From 4 → 3 (4 is followed by 3).
- From 3 → {1, 2, 4} (one of 1,2,4 must follow).

Step 3 — reason about event3 (C1)
- From the initial 1:
  - If 1 → 3 directly, event3 occurs.
  - If 1 → 2, then 2 → 4 → 3, so event3 occurs.
  - If 1 → 4, then 4 → 3, so event3 occurs.
- Therefore in every possible continuation from the initial state, event3 will occur (in at most two steps). So C1 is true.

Step 4 — reason about event4 (needed for C2)
- Although event4 occurs on some branches (e.g. 1 → 2 → 4 or 1 → 4), it is not forced in every branch.
- Example branch avoiding 4: 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (always choose 3 after 1 and 1 after 3). This loop never produces event4.
- Thus event4 is not inevitable.

Conclusion
- C1 is true, but event4 need not happen in all executions; therefore C2 (""C1 holds and event4 happens"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
We interpret the rules as “when an event happens, the next event must be one of the listed ones.” Start: event1 has happened.

1) What the hypothesis asks
- C1: event3 always happens (i.e., in every possible execution, event3 will occur).
- C2: C1 holds and event4 happens (i.e., event3 is inevitable and event4 also necessarily happens).

2) Examine the rules (transitions)
- After event1 → next is one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2 → next must be event4.
- After event4 → next must be event3.
- After event3 → next is one of {event1, event2, event4}.

3) Show event3 is inevitable (C1)
- From initial event1:
  - If we pick event3 immediately, event3 occurred.
  - If we pick event4, then rule “after event4 → event3” forces event3 next.
  - If we pick event2, then event2 forces event4, and event4 forces event3.
- So in every possible case starting from event1, within at most two steps event3 will occur. Thus C1 is true.

4) Is event4 inevitable too (so C2 true)?
- No: there are valid executions that avoid event4 forever. Example: choose event3 after event1, then choose event1 after event3, then event3 after that event1, and repeat:
  e1 → e3 → e1 → e3 → e1 → ...
  All choices respect the rules and never produce event4. So event4 is not guaranteed to occur in every execution.

Conclusion: C1 is true but event4 is not inevitable, so C2 (C1 and event4 happens) is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 always happens (i.e., in every possible future sequence, event3 occurs).
- C2: C1 holds and event4 happens (i.e., event3 is inevitable and event4 must also occur).

Step 2 — Understand the rules
- Initially: event1 happened.
- 1 -> {2,3,4} (after 1, one of 2,3,4 must happen)
- 2 -> 4 (after 2, 4 must happen)
- 4 -> 3 (after 4, 3 must happen)
- 3 -> {1,2,4} (after 3, one of 1,2,4 must happen)

Step 3 — Reason about inevitability
- From the initial 1: every immediate choice leads (possibly via forced steps) to event3:
  - 1 -> 3 (directly),
  - 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3,
  - 1 -> 4 -> 3.
  So event3 is unavoidable; C1 holds.
- However, event4 is not unavoidable. There is a valid infinite trace that never contains event4: 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... (after 3 choose 1; after 1 choose 3 repeatedly). This trace respects all rules and never includes event4.

Conclusion
- C1 is true, but C2 (which requires event4 to occur in all traces) is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point, the next state will contain Event4 (equivalently: Event4 occurs at some future time).

Examine the rules and trace possible sequences starting from the initial state:
- Initially: event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so the next state is event2.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
  - If we choose event3: then after event3, event4 must happen, so event4 occurs (C1 can hold at the following step).
  - If we choose event1: then after that event1 forces event2, and after that we can again choose event1, producing an infinite loop event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... in which event4 never occurs.

Because there exists a valid execution that never reaches event4, C2 (""event4 eventually occurs at some future point"") is not guaranteed. Therefore the hypothesis is False. 

False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e. the immediate next state is event4).
- C2 says: ""Eventually C1 holds"" (i.e. at some future point there is a state whose next state is event4).

From the rules:
- Initially: event1.
- event1 -> event2 (must).
- event2 -> either event1 or event3.

From event2 we can always choose event1, producing the infinite loop: event1 -> event2 -> event1 -> event2 -> ... In that run we never take the event2 -> event3 branch, so event3 and thus event4 never occur. Therefore there exists an execution in which C1 never becomes true, so C2 (that C1 eventually holds in all executions) is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at some state, the immediate next event is event4).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state at which C1 is true (i.e., at some point event4 occurs as the next event).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initial: event1 occurs.
- event1 → next must be event2.
- event2 → next is either event1 or event3 (non-deterministic choice).
- event3 → next must be event4.
- event4 → next is either event1 or event3.

Step 3 — trace and reasoning
- From the initial event1, we must go to event2.
- From event2 we can choose event1; then from that event1 we must go to event2 again. Repeating that choice yields the infinite trace:
  event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
  This trace never visits event3 or event4, so C1 never becomes true on that trace.
- Because there exists a valid trace where event4 never occurs, C2 (""event4 eventually occurs as the next event at some point"") is not guaranteed by the rules. (Note: C2 is satisfiable — e.g., if from event2 we choose event3, then event4 will occur next — but satisfiable is different from being necessarily true.)

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We're asked whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true. C1 says ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, either event1, or event2 must happen"" means the next state is either event1 or event2.
- Therefore there is a possible next state where event1 does happen.
- C2 requires that in the next state event1 does not happen in all possibilities. Because a next state exists where event1 does happen, C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.

Conclusion: False
---
Step 1 — meaning of the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate next state after the initial one, event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen (so the immediate next event is either event1 or event2).
- (Other rules: event2 → event3 next, event3 → event1 next, event1 → terminal. Those affect later steps but not the immediate next choice deterministically.)

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- From event4, the next state can be one of two possibilities:
  - Next = event1. Then ""event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false in that next state.
  - Next = event2. Then C1 is true in that next state.
- Because there exists an allowed next state where event1 does happen, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event1 does not happen."" C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state).

- From the context: initially event4 happened. After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen next.

- Case 1: The next state is event1. Then C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false in that next state → C2 is false.

- Case 2: The next state is event2. Then by the rules, after event2 event3 must happen, and after event3 event1 must happen. So event1 will still occur after a short sequence; thus the claim ""event1 does not happen"" is false in that branch as well (and in particular C1 does not hold in the next state).

Because C1 does not hold in the next state (in every allowed continuation), C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" (interpreted as: from any point in the future, event4 will occur again — i.e., event4 occurs repeatedly / always eventually.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., at every point in the execution, it is true that event4 will always happen in the future.)

Step 2 — restate the rules
- Initially: event4 has just happened.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3: event1 must happen.

(Repeated statements are identical and add no new options.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences and show event4 recurs
Start at 4. From 4 the only options are 1 or 3.
- If 4 -> 1, then from 1 we must go to 2 or 4. If 1 -> 4, we are back at 4 immediately. If 1 -> 2, then 2 -> 4 must follow. So any branch after 4 -> 1 returns to 4 within at most two steps.
- If 4 -> 3, then 3 -> 1, and then as above 1 -> (2 or 4) and either way leads to 4 (1->4 immediately or 1->2->4). So any branch after 4 -> 3 returns to 4 within at most three steps.

Thus from any occurrence of event4, the system is forced to reach event4 again in a bounded number of steps. There is no branch that can avoid event4 forever.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 holds: event4 will always happen again (indeed infinitely often) in every execution.
- Because the same reasoning applies at every reachable state (from any state you can show event4 will occur again), C1 is true at every point, so ""C1 always holds"" is also true.

Final answer:
True
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says “Event4 always happens” (i.e., at every step).
- From the rules: we start at event4, but after event4 the next event must be either event1 or event3 — so the very next step can be event1 or event3, not event4.
- For example, a permitted trace is 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 … which contains steps that are not event4.
- Therefore C1 is not true in all states, so the meta-statement C2 (“C1 always holds”) is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. C1 is true in every possible run)

We need to decide whether C2 is True or False given the rules and the initial event4.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (as a directed graph):
- initial: event4 occurred.
- after event4 → either event1 or event3.
- after event1 → either event2 or event4.
- after event2 → event4.
- after event3 → event1.

So edges: 4 → {1,3}; 1 → {2,4}; 2 → {4}; 3 → {1}.

Step 3 — trace and reason about all possible runs:
- From 4 you may go to 1 or 3.
- From 1 you either go directly to 4 or to 2; from 2 you must go to 4. So starting at 1 you always reach 4 within at most two steps.
- From 3 you must go to 1, and from there you reach 4 within at most two more steps.
- Thus from any state reachable after the initial 4, a 4 must occur within at most two steps. There is no choice that can avoid eventually returning to event4.

Therefore event4 occurs in every run (indeed infinitely often). So C1 is true in all runs, and hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the statements:
   - C1: ""Event4 always happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state, Event4 always happens).

2. Use the given rules and initial condition:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal: there are no successor states and no occurrence of any further events (in particular, event4 never occurs after the initial event2).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false already, because at the initial point event4 did not and cannot occur.

4. Evaluate C2:
   - There is no next state (after event2 no events can happen). Therefore there is no successor state in which C1 could hold. Under the natural interpretation here, C2 is not satisfied.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 always happens"" — this claims that in every possible run (from the initial condition) event4 will occur.
- Given initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Rule: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means if event2 has occurred, the run stops there and no further events (including event4) can ever occur.
- Therefore there is a valid run (the initial one) in which event4 never occurs, so C1 is false.
- C2 states that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is already false (there is a run with no event4), C1 cannot become true in the next state — so C2 is false as well.

Final answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen → the run terminates; there is no next state.
- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is not supported: event4 did not occur initially and cannot occur afterward because the run ended.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, but there is no next state, so C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the premises.

1. Hypothesis: C2 = (Event2 happens) OR (C1 = ""Event3 does not happen"").
2. From the context, ""Initially, event3 happened."" So C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
3. Thus C2 reduces to ""Event2 happens.""
4. After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen. But event1 or event4 may be chosen, and both are terminal (""After event1"" and ""After event4"" no other events can happen).
5. Therefore there is a valid sequence where event3 is followed by event1 (or event4), and event2 never happens.

Since event2 is not guaranteed by the premises and C1 is false, C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" i.e. (Event2) OR (not Event3).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. So C1 (not Event3) is false.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence:
- Start: event3 (given).
- After event3 choose event1. Then the sequence is event3 → event1, and it stops (event1 is terminal).
- In this sequence event3 did happen (so C1 is false) and event2 did not happen.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Since there exists a valid sequence where neither event2 happens nor C1 holds, C2 is not guaranteed true.
Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""

From the context:
- Initially event3 happened — so C1 is false.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
  - If event1 happens next, then ""after event1 no other events can happen"" so the run ends with event2 not happening.
  - If event4 happens next, ""after event4 no other events can happen"" so the run ends with event2 not happening.
  - Only in the branch where event2 happens is event2 true.

Because there is an allowed trace (initial event3 → event1) where event3 did happen (C1 false) and event2 does not happen, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens"" (event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state).

Step 2 — Use the given rules from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.

Step 3 — Reason about the next state:
- From initial event2 the next event can be event1 or event3.
- If the next event is event1, then C1 holds in the next state.
- But the next event could instead be event3; event3 does not satisfy ""event2 or event1"".

Since there is a permitted next-event (event3) that makes C1 false in the next state, C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 = ""event2 or event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate next event).
- Initially event2 happened. The rule after event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- If the next event is event1, C1 holds; if it's event3, C1 does not hold.
- Because a next-state of event3 is allowed, C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- From the rule ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"", the next state can be event1 or event3.
- C1 requires the next state to be event1 or event2. If the next state is event1, C1 holds; but if the next state is event3, C1 does not hold.

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a claim about the immediate successor state)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every state, the next state is event1)

Step 2 — examine the conditions (transition rules)
- Initially: event1.
- From event1 → next must be event3 or event4.
- From event3 → next is event1 or event4.
- From event4 → next is event2.
- From event2 → next is event1 or event3.

Step 3 — trace and find a counterexample
- At the initial state event1, the next state must be 3 or 4. In either case the next state is not event1, so C1 is false at the initial state.
- Since C1 fails at the initial state, it cannot “always” hold.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, the next state has event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions / constraints
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen (so next state after that initial event1 is event3 or event4).
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
(Repeated statements are redundant.)

Step 3 — trace from the initial state
- Because initially event1 happened, the rule ""after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen"" forces the next state to be event3 or event4 — not event1. Therefore C1 is false in that initial step.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 asserts C1 holds always, but C1 fails immediately after the initial event1. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible next state event1 occurs.

From the conditions: after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen next. That means the immediate next event after the initial event1 cannot be event1; it must be event3 or event4. For example, the trace event1 → event3 shows a next state where event1 does not happen, so C1 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C2 asserts: (event4 happens) AND (C1 holds), where C1 is “if event4 happens then event1 happens.”
- We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (and it did initially), no subsequent events can occur.
- The other rules (after event2 → one of event1/event3/event4; after event3 → event1; after event4 → event3) only apply if those prior events can occur.

Step 3 — consequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event4 cannot happen in any valid sequence.
- C1 (“if event4 happens then event1 happens”) is true: either vacuously (because event4 never happens) or directly via the chain event4 → event3 → event1.
- But C2 requires both “event4 happens” and C1. The first conjunct (“event4 happens”) is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: If event4 happens then event1 happens.
- C2: Event4 happens and C1 holds.
C2 is true only if (a) event4 actually happens and (b) the implication in C1 is valid.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal.)
- After event4 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → event1 must happen.
(Also: after event2 → one of event1, event3, or event4 must happen — not needed here.)

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, no other events (including event4) can happen at any point.
- If event4 were to happen, the rules force the sequence event4 → event3 → event1, so C1 (event4 → event1) is logically satisfied. But that is conditional on event4 occurring.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (the implication) is true as a logical consequence of the rules.
- However, event4 does not actually occur (it’s blocked by the initial event1 and its terminal rule).
- Therefore C2 (""event4 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

- C2 asserts: (event4 happens) AND (C1 holds, where C1 is ""if event4 happens then event1 happens"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once that initial event1 has occurred, the timeline permits no further events.
- Other rules (after event2 → one of event1/event3/event4; after event3 → event1; after event4 → event3) are irrelevant if no events can occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because the initial event1 has occurred and forbids any subsequent events, event4 cannot occur at any point after the initial event1.
- Therefore the antecedent of C1 (""event4 happens"") is false in all reachable situations; C1 (the implication) is vacuously true.
- But C2 requires event4 to happen. Since event4 cannot happen, C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- Initially event3 occurs.
- The rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 in the next state.
- The rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" then forces event3 in the following state, and the two rules produce an infinite e3 ↔ e2 cycle.
- There is no rule that forces event4 to ever occur; nothing in the given constraints makes event4 happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 requires both event2 and C1. Although event2 does occur next, C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what's asked:
C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event4 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — apply the rules from the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (This forces the next state to be event2.)
- No rule requires or allows event4 to happen immediately after event3; the rule about event4 is only what must happen after event4, not that event4 must occur now.

Step 3 — conclusion:
The next state must be event2, so Event2 happens next (true), but Event4 does not happen next (C1 is false). Therefore C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event4 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds (so C2 requires both Event2 and Event4 in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (This forces the very next event after the initial event3 to be event2.)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From the initial event3, the next event is required to be event2 (no option given).
- That next state therefore contains event2; it does not contain event4.
- The rules then force event3 after that, then event2, and so on (alternating 3 ↔ 2). There is no rule that allows event4 to occur next (or simultaneously with the required event2) in the immediate next state.

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- C1 is false: Event4 does not happen in the next state.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (Event4 in the next state) and event2; since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Step 1 — identify the formulas
- C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens"" (i.e., from the current point, at some future point event3 occurs).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point we will be in a state from which event3 will eventually occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions/transitions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen. So the execution reaches an event4 state and stays there (event4 is a terminal/sink state).
- The other transition rules (what happens after event1, event2, event3) are irrelevant because those states are never reached from the initial event4.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- Since we start at event4 and no further events can occur, event3 never happens. Therefore C1 is false (there is no future point where event3 occurs).
- Because C1 is false at the initial state and will remain false forever (no state from which event3 will eventually occur is ever reached), C2 (""eventually C1"") is also false.

Final answer: False

We want to decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true given the context. Steps:

1. Identify the statements:
   - C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
   - C2: ""Eventually, C1 holds"" — i.e., at some future point it becomes true that event3 will eventually happen.

2. Use the context:
   - Initially, event4 happened.
   - After event4, no other events can happen.

3. Consequence:
   - Since no events can occur after the initial event4, event3 will never occur at any time. Therefore C1 is false (event3 does not eventually happen).

4. Conclusion about C2:
   - C2 asserts that at some future point C1 will hold. But C1 never becomes true (it is false now and will remain false), so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""Eventually, C1 holds"" (i.e., at some future point it will be true that Event3 eventually happens).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen. So once event4 has occurred the system stops and no further events (including event3) can ever occur.

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- Because event4 happens initially and is terminal, event3 never occurs at any time.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is false at all times.
- Consequently there is no future point at which C1 becomes true, so C2 is also false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""event3 happens"" (repeated), and the context says initially event3 happened, so C1 holds.
- To have event4 happen, one possible path is: event3 (initial) -> event2 (must after event3) -> event1 (one allowed option after event2) -> event4 (one allowed option after event1). So event4 is possible.
- However, event4 is not required by the rules (there are choices that avoid it), so ""event4 happens and C1 holds"" is not entailed by the context — it's only one possible outcome, not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event4 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context rules.
- C1 is ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — that just asserts event3 happens (redundantly).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happens. So C1 is satisfied.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So the next event is event2.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (choice).
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen (choice).
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One possible sequence: 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... (always choose 3 after 2). This never produces event4.
- Another possible sequence: 3 → 2 → 1 → 4 (choose 1 after 2, then choose 4 after 1). This sequence does produce event4.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event4 can occur in some allowed sequences, but it is not guaranteed by the rules (there exist valid sequences with no event4).
- The context does not entail that event4 must happen, so C2 (which requires event4) is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event4 happens and C1 holds"") can be true given the rules.

Interpretation:
- C1 is just ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event3 happens"" (it holds initially).
- C2 requires both Event4 happens and Event3 happens.

Rules:
1. Initially Event3 happens. (So C1 is true initially.)
2. After Event3, Event2 must happen.
3. After Event2, either Event1 or Event3 must happen.
4. After Event1, either Event2 or Event4 must happen.
5. After Event4, either Event1 or Event3 must happen.

Construct a valid trace that satisfies C2:
- Start: Event3 (given). => C1 holds.
- After Event3 → Event2 must happen. Sequence: Event3, Event2.
- After Event2 → choose Event1. Sequence: Event3, Event2, Event1.
- After Event1 → choose Event4. Sequence: Event3, Event2, Event1, Event4.

This trace is allowed by the rules and contains both Event3 and Event4, so C2 can be satisfied. Nothing in the rules forbids this choice.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to check whether ""If event3 never happens (C1), then event2 happens (C2)"" is guaranteed by the rules.

Start: event4 happens initially. From the rules (and assuming C1: event3 never occurs), the only allowed next steps are:
- After event4: allowed {1,2,3} but 3 is forbidden by C1, so allowed {1,2}.
- If we try to avoid event2 as well, after event4 we must choose event1.
- After event1: allowed {2,4}. If we forbid event2, we must choose event4.

Thus the sequence 4,1,4,1,... (alternating 4 and 1) is a valid infinite trace that respects all given rules and never contains event3 or event2. This is a counterexample to the claim ""If no event3 then event2 happens.""

Therefore C2 is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether ""If event3 never happens (C1), then event2 must happen (C2).""

From the rules (transitions):
- 4 -> {1,2,3}
- 1 -> {2,4}
- 2 -> {1,4}
- 3 -> {2,4}

Start at 4. If we assume event3 never happens, we can choose the transitions 4 -> 1 and then 1 -> 4 repeatedly. This yields the infinite sequence 4,1,4,1,... which never contains event3 and also never contains event2. Thus C1 can hold while event2 does not happen.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
We need to determine whether ""If event3 never happens then event2 happens"" is forced by the rules.

Rules (from initial event4):
- Initially: event4.
- After 4: next ∈ {1,2,3}.
- After 1: next ∈ {2,4}.
- After 2: next ∈ {1,4}.
- After 3: next ∈ {2,4}.

Assume C1: event3 never happens. Then from any occurrence of 4 the allowed next events reduce to {1,2} (3 forbidden). To refute C2 we must exhibit a valid sequence with no 3 and no 2.

Starting at the initial 4, choose next = 1 (allowed). From 1, choose next = 4 (since 2 is avoided). From that 4 choose 1 again, and so on. The infinite alternating sequence 4,1,4,1,... respects all transition rules, contains no event3, and never contains event2.

Therefore C1 can hold without event2 happening, so ""If C1 holds then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.

   - The other implications (after event2 → event4, after event4 → either event2 or event3, after event3 → event4) are irrelevant if event1 prevents any further events.

2. From ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and the fact event1 already occurred initially, no events besides event1 can ever occur. Therefore event2 does not occur and event4 does not occur.

- C1: If event1 happens, then event4 happens (event1 -> event4).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., the implication event1 -> event4 is false).

Step 2 — Examine the given conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event2 -> event1 (thus event1 does occur).
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen. So event1 -> (event3 or event4).
- After event3, event4 must happen. So event3 -> event4.
- After event4, event1 must happen. So event4 -> event1.

Step 3 — Reason about whether event1 always leads to event4
- If after event1 the choice is event4, then event4 happens directly.
- If after event1 the choice is event3, then event3 occurs and by rule event3 -> event4, so event4 happens anyway.
- Therefore in every possible continuation after event1, event4 will occur.

Goal: decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

What C1 says: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens"" (i.e. event1 => event4).

Examine the rules:
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.

Trace possibilities after event1:
- If event4 happens directly, then event4 occurs (so C1 satisfied).
- If event3 happens, then by the rule ""after event3, event4 must happen"", event4 will occur anyway.

Thus in every possible continuation after event1, event4 occurs (possibly after an intermediate event3). Therefore C1 is true (event1 implies event4). C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False (i.e., whether C1 fails).

Step 2 — Given conditions (and immediate consequences)
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 does happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen (creates a possible loop but doesn't prevent event4).

Step 3 — Trace possibilities after event1
- If after event1 we get event4 directly, then event4 happens.
- If after event1 we get event3, then by the rule ""after event3, event4 must happen,"" event4 still happens.

In both possible branches that follow event1, event4 occurs. Therefore C1 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (relative to the current/initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the next state, event3 happens in its next state (so event3 would have to occur two steps from the initial state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event4 must happen. So the immediate next state must be event4.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (nondeterministically).
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here since event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state:
- Initial: event2.
- Next (must): event4.
- Next after that: either event2 or event3.
  - If event2 occurs there, the sequence continues event2 → event4 → event2 → ...
  - If event3 occurs there, the sequence is event2 → event4 → event3 → event4 → ...

Conclusion:
- C1 (event3 in the next state) is false because the next state after the initial event2 is necessarily event4.
- C2 (that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. event3 occurs two steps from initial) is not guaranteed because after event4 the system may choose event2 instead of event3. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
We evaluate the hypothesis at the initial state.

- Start: S0 (initial): event2 happens.
- Rule ""After event2, event4 must happen"" ⇒ S1: event4.
- C1 is ""event3 happens in the next state"" — evaluated at S0 this means ""event3 happens in S1"". But S1 has event4, so C1 is false at S0.
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — evaluated at S0 this means ""in S1, C1 is true"", i.e. ""event3 happens in S2"". From S1 (event4) the rule says S2 must be either event2 or event3. That choice is not fixed by the constraints, so S2 might be event3 but is not forced to be.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true given the constraints.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Identify the hypothesis:  
  C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state (from now).""  
  C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state."" So C2 asserts that in the next state (call it s1), C1 is true — i.e., event3 happens in the state after that (s2). In short, C2 claims event3 will occur two steps from now.

- Use the conditions starting from the initial state (s0):  
  Initially event2 happened (s0 = event2).  
  After event2, event4 must happen → s1 = event4.

- From s1 = event4, the rule says after event4 either event2 or event3 must happen → s2 ∈ {event2, event3}.

- Therefore s2 is not forced to be event3; it could be event2. C2 asserts that s2 is event3, but that is not guaranteed by the rules.

Because event3 at s2 is only one possible continuation (the other being event2), C2 is not necessarily true. Hence the correct truth value is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event2 happens."" (both events occur in the same execution)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (in every execution consistent with the constraints, both event4 and event2 occur)
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen next.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so event3 leads to event2, which is then terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible executions from the initial state
From event1 the required next choice is:
- If event2 is chosen: event2 happens and is terminal. event4 does not happen.
- If event4 is chosen: event4 happens and is terminal. event2 does not happen.
- If event3 is chosen: event3 happens, then event2 must happen (terminal). event4 does not happen.

There is no possible execution in which both event2 and event4 occur, because each is terminal and once one occurs the other cannot occur later; they are chosen exclusively after event1 (either directly or via event3→event2).

Step 4 — conclusion
C1 (both event4 and event2 occur) does not hold in any execution, so it certainly does not hold in all executions. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Identify hypothesis: C2 asserts that ""C1 always holds"", where C1 is ""Event4 happens and event2 happens"".

Examine conditions:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.

Trace possible sequences:
- event1 → event2. This is allowed (the choice after event1 = event2). After event2 no further events; event4 did not occur. So C1 is false in this run.
- event1 → event3 → event2. Allowed; ends after event2; event4 did not occur. C1 false.
- event1 → event4. Allowed; ends after event4; event2 did not occur. C1 false.

No sequence can include both event2 and event4, because either one (when it occurs) prevents any further events.

Since there exist allowed runs where C1 is false (indeed C1 can never hold), C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event2 happens."" (both occur in the same execution)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" i.e. in every allowed event sequence both event4 and event2 occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen next.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences after event1
- If event2 happens after event1: sequence is e1 → e2 and then stops (no further events). Event4 does not happen.
- If event3 happens after event1: sequence is e1 → e3 → e2 and then stops. Event4 does not happen.
- If event4 happens after event1: sequence is e1 → e4 and then stops. Event2 does not happen.

In none of the possible branches do both event4 and event2 occur together. C1 is therefore impossible in any execution, so it cannot ""always hold.""

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens.""

We must determine whether C2 follows from the given context (i.e., is C2 guaranteed/true).

Step 2 — Examine conditions
- Initially: event3 happened.
- From event3: either event2 or event4 must happen (one of them).
- From event2: event1 must happen.
- From event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- From event1: event4 must happen.

Step 3 — Analyze C1
- C1 is the tautology ""event3 → event3"", which is always true. So C1 holds.

Step 4 — Does event1 necessarily happen?
- If from event3 we pick event2, then event1 must follow (so event1 happens in that branch).
- But from event3 we could pick event4. From event4 we could pick event3 again, and then repeat: 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ...
- That infinite loop (always choosing the branch back to event3) never forces event2, and thus never forces event1.
- Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which event1 never occurs, event1 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion
- C1 holds, but event1 does not necessarily happen given the rules. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed/entailed.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" We must decide whether that follows from the given conditions starting from the initial event3.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (always true). So C1 holds.

Step 3 — does event1 necessarily happen?
- From event3 you must go to either event2 or event4.
  - If you choose event2, then event1 must happen (so event1 occurs on that path).
  - If you choose event4, after event4 you may choose event2 (which forces event1) or event3.
    - If you choose event3 again, you can repeat the choice event3 -> event4 -> event3 -> ... forever, avoiding event2 and thus avoiding event1 indefinitely.

Because there exists a valid sequence (an infinite loop 3↔4) that never leads to event1, event1 is not guaranteed to happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds, but event1 does not necessarily happen, so C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (always true).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires that event1 actually occurs (and C1, which is true).

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3: either event2 or event4 must happen (choice).
- From event2: event1 must happen.
- From event1: event4 must happen.
- From event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- One possible run: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... (here event1 does occur).
- Another possible run: 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> ... (always choose the branch back to 3, never choose event2). In this run event1 never occurs.

Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event1 never happens, event1 is not guaranteed. C1 is true, but C2 requires event1 to hold in all models; it is not entailed by the premises.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true only if C1 is true and event3 happens.

Step 2 — list the constraints
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
Because event4 has already occurred initially and no events may occur after event4, no further events can happen at any later time. That rules out any event occurring after the initial event4.

Consider C1 (event3 and event4 happen). To satisfy C1 we would need event3 to happen at some time. It cannot happen after the initial event4 (forbidden). It cannot have happened before the initial event4 because the situation describes event4 as the initial event (no prior events). If one tried to make them simultaneous, event3 having happened would require event1 to happen afterward (by the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen""), but that is impossible because no events can occur after event4. So event3 cannot happen at all given the constraints, hence C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
C2 requires C1 to hold and event3 to happen. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify what C2 asserts:
- C1: event3 happens and event4 happens.
- C2: event3 happens and C1 holds. So C2 is equivalent to ""event3 happens and event4 happens"" (C2 just repeats C1).

Step 2 — Use the context rules:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen. Therefore no events can occur after that initial event4.
- So any event that did happen must have happened at or before the initial point. With ""initially, event4 happened"" there is no earlier time to place event3, so event3 cannot occur at any time (and cannot occur after event4).

Step 3 — Conclude:
- Since event3 cannot happen while event4 has already happened initially and prevents any further events, C1 is false, and therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happened.
- Rule: after event4, no other events can happen. So once event4 has occurred, the sequence ends — no event3 can occur afterward.
- C1 asserts both event3 and event4 happen. Given the initial terminal event4 and the rule preventing any subsequent events, event3 cannot also happen. So C1 is false.
- C2 asserts event3 happens and C1 holds; since C1 is false (and event3 therefore cannot happen), C2 is also false."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" That is, whenever there is an occurrence of event3, there is (some) occurrence of event1 in the same execution.
- From the context, event1 has happened initially (at the start of every execution).
- All possible executions start with that initial event1, then follow 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> (1 or 2) -> ...
- Therefore any occurrence of event3 in any execution has that initial event1 in its history. So C1 holds.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample to C1
Consider the run where at every choice after event4 we pick event2 (never pick event1). One possible infinite trace:
1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...
- Event3 clearly occurs (multiple times).
- After those later event3 occurrences, event1 does not occur (we never choose the event4->event1 branch).
Thus there are occurrences of event3 that are not followed (or implied) by event1.

Step 4 — conclusion
C1 is not guaranteed by the rules, so ""C1 does not hold"" is true.

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 is true given the context.

Interpretation:
- ""Initially, event4 happened."" means at state s0: event4.
- ""After X, Y must happen"" means in the next state after X occurs, Y must occur.
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" — at s0 this claims s1 has event4.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at s0 this claims that at s1, C1 is true; i.e. at s2 event4 holds. (So C2 asserts event4 at s2.)

Trace using the rules:
- s0: event4 (given).
- After event4, event1 must happen, so s1: event1.
- After event1, event3 must happen, so s2: event3.
- After event3, event1 must happen, so s3: event1, etc.

Conclusions:
- C1 (event4 at s1) is false, because s1 must be event1.
- C2 (event4 at s2) is also false, because s2 must be event3.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (relative to the initial state)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" i.e., in the next state, it is true that event4 happens in the next state (so C2 asserts event4 happens two steps from now).

Examine the conditions and trace the sequence:
- Initially (time 0) event4 happened.
- Rule: After event4, event1 must happen → at time 1: event1.
- Rule: After event1, event3 must happen → at time 2: event3.
- Rule: After event3, event1 must happen → at time 3: event1, and this alternation continues.

Now evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event4 at time 1) is false, because time 1 is event1.
- C2 asserts C1 holds at time 1, i.e. that event4 occurs at time 2. But time 2 is event3, not event4, so C2 is also false.

Final answer: False

1. Let t0 be the initial state. At t0 event4 happened (given).
2. Rule: after event4, event1 must happen. So at t1 (the next state) event1 must hold.
3. C1 asserts: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" — that would mean event4 holds at t1. That is not required by any rule; only event1 is required at t1. So C1 is not guaranteed at t0.
4. C2 asserts: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — equivalently, at t1 it must be true that event4 holds at t2. But at t1 we have event1, and rule: after event1, event3 must happen — so at t2 event3 must hold. Nothing forces event4 at t2. Hence C1 does not hold at t1, so C2 is not true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the formulas mean:
- C1 = ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e. at state1).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — so at state1 it must be true that event4 happens in that state's next state (i.e. event4 at state2). Equivalently, C2 asserts that event4 occurs two steps from the initial state.

Step 2 — follow the rules from the initial state:
- Initially (state0) event3 happened.
- From event3, the next event (state1) must be either event2 or event4.

Consider the two possible branches:
1. If state1 = event4, then from event4 the following event (state2) must be event1 or event3 — so state2 ≠ event4. Thus C2 is false in this branch.
2. If state1 = event2, then from event2 the following event (state2) must be event1 or event4 — so state2 might be event4 but it's not guaranteed. Thus C2 is not guaranteed (could be false) in this branch as well.

Because there is at least one possible continuation (indeed both branches allow C2 to be false or not guaranteed), C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the temporal reading:

- The context gives initial state: event3 just happened.
- The rules are transition constraints:
  - After event1, event2 must happen next.
  - After event2, next is either event1 or event4.
  - After event4, next is either event1 or event3.
  - After event3, next is either event2 or event4.

- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" = X(event4).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X(C1) = XX(event4) (event4 happens two steps from now).

Now trace possible next-two-step sequences from the initial event3:

- If next = event4 (allowed because after event3 it can be event2 or event4), then the state after that must be either event1 or event3 (by the rule for event4). So in this branch the state two steps from now is event1 or event3, not event4 — XX(event4) is false in this branch.

- If next = event2, then the state after that is either event1 or event4 (by the rule for event2). In this branch XX(event4) could be true (if event4 is chosen) but is not guaranteed.

Because there exists a valid path (e.g., event3 → event4 → event1) where XX(event4) is false, C2 is not guaranteed true.

Final answer: False
---
We read C1 as: ""Event4 happens in the next state (t1)"".  
C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. from the current state, at t1 it is true that event4 will happen at t2. So C2 asserts: event4 happens at t2.

Start: at t0 event3 happened. From the rules:
- After event3, at t1 either event2 or event4 must happen.
- If t1 = event2, then at t2 either event1 or event4 must happen (so event4 at t2 is possible but not forced).
- If t1 = event4, then at t2 either event1 or event3 must happen (so event4 at t2 is not forced).

Thus there are possible runs where event4 does not occur at t2 (e.g. t0: event3 → t1: event4 → t2: event1, or t0: event3 → t1: event2 → t2: event1). Therefore C2 (that event4 definitely happens at t2) is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True. C1 says ""Event3 always happens."" So C2 asserts that in every possible future sequence (given the rules and the initial event2), Event3 always occurs.

Transitions:
- From 1 → {2, 3}
- From 2 → {1, 3}
- From 3 → {1, 4}
- From 4 → {1, 3}
Initial event: 2.

Counterexample trace: choose 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... forever. All transitions in this loop are allowed (2→1 and 1→2), and this infinite sequence never includes event3. Thus C1 is false (event3 does not always happen), so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning
1. Interpret rules as nondeterministic transitions:
   - From 1 → {2, 3}
   - From 2 → {1, 3}
   - From 3 → {1, 4}
   - From 4 → {1, 3}
   - Initially: event2 happened.

2. C1 (""Event3 always happens"") means every possible future sequence must contain event3 at every step (or at least cannot avoid event3). To refute it it suffices to exhibit a valid execution that never hits event3.

3. Construct a valid execution avoiding event3:
   - Start at initial event2.
   - From 2 choose event1 (allowed).
   - From 1 choose event2 (allowed).
   - Repeat: 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → … indefinitely.
   This infinite run never includes event3 and respects all transition rules.

4. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the context.

Interpretation:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — i.e. at every step/event, event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. C1 is guaranteed by the rules (it holds in all possible event sequences).

From the rules (transitions):
- initially: event2.
- after event2 → either event1 or event3.
- after event1 → either event2 or event3.
- after event3 → either event1 or event4.
- after event4 → either event1 or event3.

Counterexample sequence that follows the rules but avoids event3 entirely:
- Start at event2 (given).
- Choose event1 next (allowed).
- From event1 choose event2 (allowed).
- Repeat: 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... indefinitely.

This infinite sequence never contains event3, so ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false in at least one permitted behavior. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

- The other rules describe what must follow after events, but they do not negate the fact that event1 already happened initially.

Step 3 — trace/reason:
- Because event1 happened initially, the disjunction in C1 (event1 or event4) is satisfied.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 is true, therefore C2 (which asserts C1 does not hold) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = (event4 happens AND event2 happens).
- C2 = (C1) OR (event1 happens). So C2 asserts ""either (event4 and event2) hold, or event1 holds.""

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen next.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen next.
- After event1, event3 must happen next.
- After event4, event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — exhibit a valid sequence that falsifies C2
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose after event3 → event2.
- After event2 → choose event3.
- After event3 → choose event2.
- Repeat: ... 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ...

This infinite (or arbitrarily long finite) sequence conforms to all given rules: after each 3 we pick 2 (allowed), after each 2 we pick 3 (allowed). In this sequence event1 never occurs and event4 never occurs, so C1 is false (event4 does not happen) and event1 is false. Therefore C2 is false in this allowed scenario.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed by the context; answer: False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- To show whether C2 is necessarily true, we must consider all possible allowed sequences.

Construct a valid sequence that makes C2 false:
- Choose event2 after event3. Now sequence: 3, 2.
- From event2, one allowed next event is event3. Choose event3. Sequence: 3, 2, 3.
- Repeat: from event3 choose event2, from event2 choose event3, etc.

This infinite loop (3,2,3,2,...) is consistent with all given rules and never produces event1 or event4. In that execution:
- C1 (event4 and event2 both happen) is false (event4 never occurs).
- event1 never happens.
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds or event1 happens) is false.

Because there exists a valid execution consistent with the constraints where C2 is false, C2 is not guaranteed true. Hence the correct answer is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (i.e., C1 ∨ event1).
We must determine whether C2 is necessarily true given the rules and the initial event3.

Step 2 — Examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event1 → event3 must happen.
- After event4 → event2 must happen.

Step 3 — Find a legal sequence that tests C2
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose after event3 → event2.
- After event2 → choose event3.
- Repeat: event3 → event2 → event3 → ...
This infinite sequence is allowed by the rules (each step picks an allowed successor) and never includes event1 or event4, though event2 does occur.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2 on that sequence
- C1 requires both event4 and event2. In this sequence event4 never occurs, so C1 is false (even though event2 does occur).
- event1 never occurs in the sequence.
- Therefore C2 (C1 ∨ event1) is false in this valid sequence.

Conclusion
Because there exists a permitted sequence where neither C1 nor event1 ever happens, C2 is not guaranteed and is False.

2. C2 is the negation of C1: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., neither Event1 nor Event4 happens.
3. The context begins with ""Initially, event4 happened."" That means Event4 does happen (at least at the start).
4. Therefore C1 is true (because Event4 happens), so its negation C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen in the next state. So the next state can only contain event1 or event2.
- Event4 can only occur after event1 (and when event4 occurs no further events can happen). Therefore event4 cannot occur immediately after event3 unless event1 occurred first and then one more step passed.
- C1 requires both event4 and event2 to hold in the same (next) state. That is impossible given that the next state can only be event1 or event2, and event4 cannot occur there.

Thus C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- By the rule ""After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen,"" the immediate next state can only contain event1 or event2.
- C1 requires both event4 and event2 to happen in the same state. In the immediate next state after event3, event4 cannot occur (only event1 or event2 can).
- Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event2 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state, both event4 and event2 must hold.

Step 2 — Apply the initial condition and rules:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next. So the next state must be event1 or event2.
- Therefore the next state cannot be event4.
- Also the rules imply a single event occurs per state (choices are exclusive), so the next state cannot simultaneously be event2 and event4.

Step 3 — Conclusion:
- It is impossible for both event4 and event2 to hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the rules
- Start: event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen, so the next event is event1.
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event2 or event4, no further events occur.

Step 2 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (To refute C1 it suffices to exhibit a valid execution where event3 does not keep occurring.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" For C2 to be true in all executions, either C1 must hold in every execution or event4 must happen in every execution.

Step 3 — produce a concrete valid execution that contradicts C2
- Following the rules we can take the sequence: event3 (initial) → event1 → event2. After event2 nothing else happens. This sequence is allowed by the rules.
- In that execution, event3 does not ""always happen"" (it occurs only initially and not thereafter), so C1 is false.
- Also event4 does not occur in this execution.

Because there exists a valid execution where neither C1 holds nor event4 happens, C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---

---
Step 1 — interpret the rules
- Start: event3 has occurred.
- After event3, event1 must occur next.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must occur.
- event2 and event4 are terminating (no further events after them).

Step 2 — exhibit a permitted trace that falsifies the disjunction
Consider the trace: event3 (initial) → event1 → event2. This follows all rules:
- Initial event3 is given.
- After that event3, event1 happens (required).
- After that event1, we choose event2 (allowed).
- After event2 nothing more happens (allowed).

In this trace:
- event4 does not happen.
- event3 does not continue to happen after the initial occurrence (so “event3 always happens” is not satisfied if “always” means guaranteed for all future steps).

Step 3 — conclude about C2
C2 is ""C1 holds or event4 happens"". The trace above makes both disjuncts false (C1 fails and event4 does not occur). Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After any event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- If event3 happens, it is terminal and C1 holds on that run.
- But if after event1 we choose event2, then ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" bringing us back to event1.
- Repeating the choice of event2 after each event1 yields an infinite loop: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... with event3 never occurring.
- Because there exists at least one valid sequence where event3 never happens, C1 is not guaranteed in all runs. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
Let's break it down.

- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
  - If event3 happens, C1 (event3 eventually happens) is satisfied on that run.
  - If event2 happens, then after event2 event1 must happen, and after that again either event2 or event3 must happen.
- Nothing forces eventually choosing event3 instead of repeatedly choosing event2. So there is a possible infinite execution: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... in which event3 never occurs.

C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed on every possible execution, therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" (in a run).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = in every possible allowed run, event3 eventually happens.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (i.e., at least one of those must occur next/afterwards).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., event2 → later event1).
- After event3, no further events can occur (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, no further events can occur (irrelevant here since nothing forces event4).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event1, one allowed choice is to do event3 next — that run has event3 and satisfies C1.
- Another allowed choice is to do event2 next. After event2, a rule requires event1 to happen, and after that event1 again we may choose event2 (again) rather than event3. Repeating this yields an infinite run: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... with no event3 ever occurring. All rules are satisfied on this run.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists an allowed run in which event3 never happens, C1 is not guaranteed in all runs.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — meaning in every possible execution (starting from the initial condition), event3 occurs at some point.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., C1 is true for the system).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible executions
- From the initial event4, one allowed next event is event1. If we choose that, the sequence is: event4 → event1, and then it stops (event1 is terminal). In this execution event3 never occurs.
- Since there exists at least one valid execution where event3 does not happen, C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false.

Final determination
- C2 (that C1 always holds) is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible sequence starting from the initial state, event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in all possible runs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 has happened.
- From event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- event1 and event3 are terminal (no further events after them).
- From event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences and find a counterexample
- One possible sequence is: event4 → event1. Since event1 is terminal, the sequence ends and event3 never occurs.
- Because there exists a valid sequence (4 then 1) in which event3 does not happen, C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Since C1 is false, C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible execution, event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — asking whether C1 is true in all possible executions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace possibilities
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen next.
- If event1 happens next, no other events can happen (sequence ends) — event3 does not occur in that execution.
- If event2 happens next, then either event1 or event3 must follow; choosing event1 leads to a sequence with no event3.
- If event3 happens next, event3 does occur (but that’s only one possible branch).

Step 3 — conclusion
- There exist executions (e.g., event4 → event1, or event4 → event2 → event1) where event3 never happens, so C1 is not always true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens. By ""after event3, event2 must happen"", the next state is event2.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") requires event2 to hold in every state. That is false already (initial state had event3, not event2).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., from the next state onward event2 always holds). From the next state we have event2, then by ""after event2, event1 must happen"" the following state is event1 — so event2 does not hold in that subsequent state. Therefore C1 does not hold starting at the next state.
- Hence C2 is False.
---
C1: ""Event2 always happens"" means event2 holds at every state (globally).
C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means that starting from the state immediately after the initial one, event2 holds at every future state.

From the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So the next state (after the initial) is event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So the state after that is event1 (which is not event2).

Therefore starting from the next state (which is event2), event2 does not hold at every future state (it is followed by event1). So C1 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (interpreted as: in every future state, Event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. starting at the next state, Event2 holds in every subsequent state).

Step 2 — Examine the given conditions / transitions
- Initial state: event3.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace from the initial state
- State0: event3 (given).
- State1 (next): must be event2 (since after event3, event2 must happen).
- State2: after event2, event1 must happen → state2 is event1 (so event2 does not hold in state2).

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 at the next state (C2)
- At State1 (the ""next"" state), C1 would require that event2 holds in every subsequent state. But State2 is event1, so event2 does not hold in all subsequent states.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event3 happened.
- From 3 the next event must be either 2 or 4.
- From 2 the next event must be 1 or 4 (so the immediate successor of a 2 is never 2).
- From 4 the next event must be 1.
- From 1 the next event is 2, 3, or 4.

C1 (""Event2 always happens"") requires that from some point forward every event is event2. That is impossible because whenever event2 occurs the next event must be 1 or 4 (not 2). So there is no point after which every subsequent event is event2. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The hypothesis C1 is ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., from some point onward every step is event2). C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds (there is a time after which every event is event2).

- From the rules: after event2 the next event must be either event1 or event4. In particular, it is impossible to have two consecutive event2 occurrences.

- Therefore there is no point from which every subsequent event is event2. C1 can never hold at any time, so it cannot eventually hold.

Hence C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1 = ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. from some time on, at every step the event is event2).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point, C1 becomes true; formally F G(event2)).

Step 2 — list the transition rules (from the context):
- 3 -> {2,4}
- 2 -> {1,4}
- 4 -> {1}
- 1 -> {2,3,4}
Initial state: 3.

Step 3 — reason about possibility of C1:
- For C1 to be true at any point, every subsequent event must be event2.
- But from event2 the next event must be 1 or 4 (there is no 2 -> 2 transition). So it is impossible for event2 to occur at every subsequent step.
- Therefore C1 can never be true at any point in any execution.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- Since C1 can never become true, ""eventually C1"" is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1 says: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 says: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible allowed sequence, both event2 and event3 occur).
You are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This forbids any events occurring after the initial event1.)
- The other rules (after event2 → either event1 or event4, after event4 → event3, after event3 → either event1 or event2) are irrelevant if event2/event3/event4 never occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, the only actual sequence is: event1 (and then nothing).
- Therefore event2 does not happen and event3 does not happen in this sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event3 and event2 happen) is false in the actual/only possible sequence.
- C2 claims C1 always holds; since C1 does not hold in the only allowed sequence, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every allowed event sequence, both event3 and event2 occur)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal.)
- Other rules (after event2 → either event1 or event4; after event4 → event3; after event3 → either event1 or event2) only matter if those events can occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 occurs initially and no events can happen after event1, the only possible sequence is: event1 and then stop.
- In that sequence, neither event2 nor event3 occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false in the only allowed sequence (event2 and event3 do not happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible execution, both event3 and event2 occur).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event1 happened.""
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — once event1 has occurred, the execution ends; no further events can occur.
- The other rules (what happens after event2, event3, event4) are irrelevant if nothing can occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — Reason about possible executions:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no event2 and no event3 can ever occur in any execution starting from this initial state.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- C1 is false (neither event2 nor event3 occurs).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G X event2).

Examine the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen next.
- After event3, event4 must happen next.
- After event4, event3 must happen next.
- After event2, event3 must happen next.

Construct a valid trace consistent with the context:
- Time0: event1 (given).
- By the rule after event1, Time1 must be either event3 or event4. Choose event3.
- Then by the rule after event3, Time2 = event4.
- Then Time3 = event3, Time4 = event4, ... alternating 3 and 4 forever.

In this trace, at Time0 the next state (Time1) is event3, not event2, so C1 is false at Time0. Thus C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. From ""After event1, either event3, or event4 must happen"", the next state after the initial one must have event3 or event4 — not event2.
3. There is no rule forcing event2 to occur anywhere; rules only require event3 after event2 or event4, and require event4 after event3. Those allow sequences like event3↔event4 repeatedly without event2 ever occurring.
4. Since there exists a permitted next-state (event3 or event4) where event2 does not happen, C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is not always true. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, Event2 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — Examine the given conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen (one of them, not event2).
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Reason about possible sequences
- From the initial event1, the required next event is either event3 or event4.
- If event3 occurs, it forces event4 next, which forces event3 next, etc. That yields an alternating 3↔4 loop; event2 never needs to occur.
- If event4 occurs instead, it forces event3 next and then the same 3↔4 loop.
- There is no rule forcing event2 to occur at any point; event2 is optional and not required by the constraints.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is not guaranteed (there exist valid traces where the next state is event3 or event4 instead).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" C2: ""C1 always holds"" means every time (in every state) the immediate next event must be event4.
- From the context: initially event1. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so the immediate next event from the initial state could be event2).
- If the next event is event2, then the next state is event2, not event4 — so C1 fails in that case.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in all states, so C2 is False.
---
Identify hypotheses
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e. from the current state, the immediate next event is event4)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. in every state, the next event is event4)

Examine the rules
- Initially: event1.
- From event1 → next is event2 or event3.
- From event2 → next is event3 or event4.
- From event3 → next is event4.
- From event4 → next is event1 or event3.

Counterexample showing C2 fails
- From the initial state (event1), it is allowed that the next event is event2. That means C1 (""next is event4"") is false at the initial state.
- Because there exists a reachable state (the initial state) where C1 is false, C1 does not always hold.

Final answer
False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means every possible next-state transition must be event4.
- From the given rules: event1 → {event2, event3}. The system starts with event1. Therefore the next state can be event2 (or event3).
- Choosing event2 as the next state is allowed, and event2 is not event4. Hence C1 does not hold in that possible next state.
- Because there is a reachable transition where C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True or False, where C1 is ""Event3 always happens.""

Interpretation: ""Event3 always happens"" means at every future state along the run (i.e., globally) event3 holds. C2 claims that this global property holds starting from the next state.

Start from the given initial fact:
- Initially event1 happened.

From the rules:
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.

Therefore there are two possible immediate next states:
1. Next state is event2. In that state event3 is false right away, so ""event3 always happens"" is already falsified at the next state. Thus C1 does not hold in that next state.
2. Next state is event3. Even if the next state is event3, consider further choices: after event3 → event4, and after event4 we may choose event1, and after that we may choose event2 instead of event3. That yields a later state where event3 is false, so ""event3 always happens"" is again falsified.

Either way there is a reachable next-state scenario (in fact multiple) that violates ""event3 always happens."" So C1 does not hold in the next state, and thus C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypotheses mean
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — i.e. from a given state onward, event3 holds in every future state (G event3).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the initial state, for every immediate successor state, C1 is true there.

Step 2 — initial conditions and transition rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1: next must be event2 or event3.
- From event2: next must be event1 or event4.
- From event4: next must be event1 or event2.
- From event3: next must be event4.

Step 3 — examine successors of the initial state
The initial state (event1) has two possible next states:
- Next = event3. In that successor, the immediate next after it must be event4 (so event3 does not hold in all future states). Hence C1 is false in this successor.
- Next = event2. From event2 one can choose event1 next, and then repeat event1↔event2 forever, never visiting event3. Hence C1 is false in this successor too.

Because there exists (in fact both) immediate successors of the initial state where C1 is false, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., from the immediate next state onward, event3 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially: event1 occurred.
- After event1: next must be event2 or event3.
- After event2: next must be event1 or event4.
- After event3: next must be event4.
- After event4: next must be event1 or event2.

Step 3 — show C1 is false
- If event3 occurred at some time, the next event must be event4, so event3 cannot hold at every step. Therefore C1 (""event3 always happens"") is impossible.

Step 4 — show C2 is false
- From the initial event1, the next event could be event2. From event2 we may go to event1, then back to event2, and so on (1 → 2 → 1 → 2 ...), never reaching event3. So even in the next state (if that state is event2) C1 does not hold.
- Even if the next state were event3, the very next step must be event4, so event3 would not hold always from that point either.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e., either event1 eventually occurs, or event2 occurs)

Step 2 — examine the conditions and initial state
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- From event4 the next event must be event2.
- From event1 the next is {event2, event4} (but if event1 occurs, C1 already holds).
- From event2 the next is {event1, event3} (but if event2 occurs, C2 is satisfied via the ""event2 happens"" disjunct).

Step 3 — consider all possible immediate successors of the initial state
- If next = event1: then C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- If next = event2: then event2 happens, so C2 is true.
- If next = event4: then by the rule after event4, event2 must happen next, so event2 will happen and C2 is true.

There is no possible continuation from the initial state that avoids both event1 and event2. Therefore C2 is guaranteed.

Final answer:

Identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e., either event1 occurs at some point, or event2 occurs.)

Examine the conditions / transitions
- Initially event3 occurred.
- From event3 the next event must be one of: event1, event2, or event4.
- From event4 the next event must be event2.
- From event1 the next event is event2 or event4 (both lead to event2 eventually).
- From event2 the next event is event1 or event3 (not needed further here).

Trace possible immediate choices from the initial event3
- If after event3 we get event1 → C1 is true, so C2 true.
- If after event3 we get event2 → event2 happens, so C2 true.
- If after event3 we get event4 → then event4 must be followed by event2, so event2 happens, so C2 true.

Thus in every possible branch starting from the initial event3, either event1 occurs or event2 occurs (in fact event2 occurs in all branches except the branch that immediately chooses event1, and even that branch later leads to event2). Therefore C2 is necessarily true.

Sample responses:
We interpret:
- C1 = ""Event4 always happens"" (globally: at every future step/event).
- C2 = ""Eventually C1 holds"" (there is a time after which event4 holds at every step).

Reasoning:
1. Initially event2 happens.
2. From event2 the system must go to event1 or event4.
3. From event4 the system must go to event2 (given).
4. Therefore any occurrence of event4 is immediately followed by event2. In particular, there cannot be two consecutive event4 occurrences, and you cannot have a suffix of the run where every step is event4.
5. Thus C1 (event4 at every step) can never be true at any time, so it cannot become permanently true later.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""event4 always happens"" (i.e., at every step from some point onward every event is event4).
- From the rules: after event4, event2 must happen. So no two consecutive steps can both be event4.
- Therefore it's impossible to reach a point after which every step is event4.
- Hence C1 cannot ever hold, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e. from some point onward every event is event4, formalized as G(event4)).  
- C2 is ""eventually C1 holds"" (i.e. there exists a time after which all events are event4, formalized as F(G(event4))).  

From the rules and the initial condition:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- From event2 the next event must be 1 or 4.
- From event4 the next event must be event2.

Therefore any occurrence of event4 is immediately followed by event2. That makes it impossible to have two consecutive event4s, hence impossible to have a suffix of the run in which every step is event4. So G(event4) can never hold at any point, and therefore F(G(event4)) (C2) is false."

We are given the transition rules and the initial condition that event3 happened. 

Hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 happens or event3 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., neither event4 nor event3 happens).

Step-by-step:
1. The initial condition explicitly states event3 happened.
2. That makes the disjunction in C1 (“event4 or event3”) true immediately (because event3 occurred).
3. Therefore C1 holds.
4. C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 does hold, C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (Event4 happens) OR (Event3 happens).
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = NOT(Event4 happens OR Event3 happens) = (neither Event4 nor Event3 happens).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event3 happened. That alone makes ""Event3 happens"" true (at least at the initial time).
- The other post-conditions (what must happen after each event) are irrelevant to the truth of C1 because C1 already holds due to the initial Event3.

Step 3 — Conclusion:
- C1 is true (because Event3 happened initially), so C2 (the negation of C1) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (i.e., at some future point event2 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That is ""eventually (eventually event2)"". In temporal logic ""eventually eventually P"" is equivalent to ""eventually P"", so C2 is equivalent to C1.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event4 must happen. (so initial step: 1 → 4)
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen. (choice)
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen. (choice)
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen. (choice)

Step 3 — construct a valid infinite trace that avoids event2
- Start: 1 (given) → by rule → 4.
- From 4 choose 3 (allowed). From 3 choose 1 (allowed). From 1 → 4 again.
- Repeat: 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → ...
This infinite trace respects every rule (after each event the required next events are chosen), yet never includes event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid behavior that never produces event2, ""event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 is not necessarily true, and C2 (equivalent to C1) is also not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (F event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). Note F(F event2) ≡ F event2, so C2 is equivalent to C1.

Step 2 — list the transition rules (from the context)
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- 1 → 4 (after event1, event4 must happen).
- 4 → {2, 3} (after event4, either event2 or event3 must happen).
- 3 → {1, 4} (after event3, either event1 or event4 must happen).
- 2 → {1, 4} (after event2, either event1 or event4 must happen).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial 1 we must go to 4.
- From 4 we may choose 2 (so event2 can occur), or choose 3.
- If we always choose 3 at each 4, we can follow the cycle 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → ... indefinitely and never reach event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a valid infinite trace that never contains event2, ""eventually event2"" is not guaranteed. Thus C1 (and hence C2) is not necessarily true from the initial state.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point it becomes true that event2 will eventually happen).
- Note: in linear temporal logic, F(F P) is equivalent to F P, so C2 is equivalent to C1 (both assert that event2 happens at some future time).

Step 2 — conditions summarized
- Initially: event1 occurs.
- After event1: event4 must occur.
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must occur.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must occur.
- (Some rules are duplicated but convey the same choices.)

Step 3 — trace reasoning
- From the initial event1 we must go to event4.
- From event4 we may choose event3 (allowed by ""either event2 or event3"").
- From event3 we may choose event4 (allowed by ""either event1 or event4"").
- Repeating that choice yields the infinite sequence: event1, event4, event3, event4, event3, event4, ... 
- This infinite trace never contains event2. Because choices are nondeterministic, such a trace is permitted by the rules.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since there is a valid infinite execution that never reaches event2, ""event2 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Hence C1 is not necessarily true, and so C2 is also false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. from the state reached after the first transition, event4 will eventually happen.

Examine the allowed transitions:
- From event1 → either event2 or event3.
- From event2 → event4 (must).
- From event3 → either event1 or event2.
- From event4 → either event1 or event3.

Consider the possible next states after the initial event1:
- If the next state is event2, then event4 must occur next, so C1 holds.
- If the next state is event3, there are two continuations:
  - event3 → event2 → event4 (so C1 holds), or
  - event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... (loop forever between event1 and event3), never reaching event4.

Because from the next state = event3 there exists a valid infinite run that never reaches event4, event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen from that next state. Thus C1 need not hold in the next state, and C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurs, so the next state is either event2 or event3.
- If the next state is event2, then event4 must follow (2 → 4), so event4 does eventually occur on that branch.
- If the next state is event3, there is a permitted loop 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... (since 3 → 1 and 1 → 3 are allowed). This infinite loop avoids event2 and thus event4 forever.
- Because from one possible next state (event3) event4 need not ever occur, C1 (""event4 eventually happens"") does not hold in that next state. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 says: ""C1 (event4 eventually happens) holds in the next state"" — i.e., immediately after the initial event1, from that next state event4 is guaranteed to occur eventually.
- From event1 the next event may be event2 or event3.
  - If the next event is event2, then event4 must happen after event2, so C1 would hold in that branch.
  - But if the next event is event3, then after event3 the system may choose event1 (rather than event2). After that event1 may again lead to event3, and so on.
- Therefore there is a valid infinite trace: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... which never reaches event4.
- Because there exists a possible next-state branch (the one with event3) in which event4 never occurs, C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.

Thus C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- C1 = ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2 = ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., whenever event1 happens, event2 always happens thereafter.)

From the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- (The rules involving event3 and event4 are irrelevant unless those events occur; nothing forces them from the given starting point.)

Starting from the initial event1, event2 must occur next, then event1 must occur after that, and so on, producing an endless alternation 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → … . Thus once event1 happens, event2 will necessarily occur (in fact repeatedly). Therefore C1 holds in any run where event1 happens, and C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 always happens.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event2 always happens).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Reasoning through sequences:
- From the initial event1, the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” forces event2 next.
- From that event2, “after event2, event1 must happen” forces event1 next.
- Thus once event1 occurs, the system is forced into an alternating 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 ... sequence forever. No rule allows leaving that 1–2 loop to produce event3 or event4 (those require event3 to appear first, which has no trigger from 1 or 2).
- Therefore, after event1 occurs, event2 does indeed keep occurring (in every subsequent cycle).

Conclusion:
C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (C1 is ""Event2 always happens"".)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- (There are also rules for events 3 and 4, but nothing leads to 3 or 4 from 1 or 2.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event1, the rules force event2 next.
- From event2, the rules force event1 next.
- So the system enters an inexorable 1 ↔ 2 loop; event2 occurs repeatedly (i.e., ""always happens"" in this execution).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- Given event1 occurs (indeed it does initially), the rules ensure event2 always occurs (C1 holds).
- Therefore the implication ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is true.

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event4 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point both event1 and event4 have occurred (event4 already occurs initially, so we need event1 to occur later).

Step 2 — Examine the transition rules (from the context):
- Initially event4 has happened.
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — Reason about possible sequences:
- From the initial event4, one allowed next move is event2. From event2 one allowed next move is event4. So the infinite sequence 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → ... is allowed by the rules.
- In that infinite execution event1 never occurs, so C1 never becomes true on that path (even though event4 occurs repeatedly).
- Because there exists an allowed behavior that forever avoids event1, C1 does not inevitably (necessarily) eventually hold.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C1 requires that event1 and event4 both happen.
- Initially event4 has already happened (given).
- From event4, the rules allow either event2 or event3 to happen next.
- If we choose event3 next, then from event3 the rules allow either event1 or event4. Choosing event1 yields event1.
- Thus the sequence 4 (initial) → 3 → 1 produces both event4 and event1, so C1 holds at that point.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfiable — True."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpretations:
  - C1: ""Event4 always happens"" means from some point onward every step/event is event4 (i.e. globally/eventually always event4).
  - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means there exists a time after which C1 is true (there is a suffix of the run where every event is event4).

- Given rules:
  - Initially event4 occurred.
  - After event4 the next event must be either event1 or event3.
  - After event1 the next event must be either event3 or event4.
  - After event3 no further events can occur (terminal).
  - After event2 the next must be event4 (not used here since event2 never appears from the given initial/other rules).

- Examine possibilities:
  - If from some event4 you pick event3 next, the run ends at event3. From that point event4 is not happening, so C1 is false.
  - If from event4 you pick event1 next, you can return to event4 (4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → …), but that alternates: event4 does not hold at every step (event1 steps exist), so C1 is not satisfied.
  - There is no transition that yields an infinite suffix consisting only of event4, because after any event4 the next event must be 1 or 3 (never 4). So it's impossible to reach a point after which only event4 occurs.

Therefore C1 cannot ever become true from some point onward, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") means that at every step from some point onward the occurring event is event4.
- From the rules: after any occurrence of event4 the next event must be either event1 or event3. Thus event4 can never occur twice in a row.
- Therefore there is no future point after which only event4 happens forever (either the trace ends at event3, or event1 occurs between every two event4s).
- Hence C1 can never become true eventually, so C2 is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""event4 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/event occurrence, event4 holds).
- C2 says ""there is a time after which C1 holds"" (i.e., eventually all future events are event4).

From the rules:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After any event4, the next event must be either event1 or event3. Thus two event4s cannot occur consecutively.
- After event1, the next event is either event3 or event4.
- After event3 no further events occur.

Because event4 cannot occur twice in a row, there is no suffix of the execution consisting only of event4. For example, an infinite run 4,1,4,1,4,... never has ""always event4"" true at any point; a run 4,3 terminates and does not produce an infinite suffix of only event4. Hence there is no time after which every event is event4, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""

Examine the rules:
- Start: event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So sequence begins event2 → event1.)
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen. (This allows event3.)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (So event3 → event2 → event1 → ...)
- After event4, one of event1 or event2 must happen.

Construct a valid sequence exhibiting event3:
event2 → event1 → event3 → event2 → event1 → ...
This follows all rules (event1 can lead to event3, event3 must lead to event2, etc.). Thus event3 can and does occur in at least one permitted run.

Since C2 asserts that C1 ""always"" holds (i.e., event3 never happens in any allowed sequence), and we have a valid counterexample where event3 does happen, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 is ""Event3 does not happen."" So C2 asserts that Event3 never happens in any possible execution.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- After event1, the rules allow event2, event3, or event4 — i.e. event3 is a permitted next event.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence: event2 → event1 → event3. So event3 can occur.
- Since C2 requires that event3 never happens in any execution, but we have a valid execution where event3 does happen, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:
- Start: event2 happened.
- From event2, event1 must happen → sequence begins: event2 → event1.
- From event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen. Choosing event3 is allowed, so we can have event2 → event1 → event3.
- Therefore event3 can occur (and after event3, event2 must happen, forming a valid cycle).

Since there exists a valid sequence where event3 happens, C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is not always true, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis:
- C2 says ""Event3 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 says ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""
So C2 is equivalent to ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""

Examine the conditions and trace sequences:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

From the last rule we can choose event3 after event4, yielding a repeating sequence 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... in which event2 never occurs. Because such a valid sequence exists, event2 is not guaranteed to ever happen. Therefore C1 (and thus C2) is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event4 must happen; after event4 one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- C2 asserts ""event3 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""event3 happens and event2 happens"". So C2 is equivalent to ""event3 happens and event2 happens"".
- Event3 does happen initially, but event2 is not forced by the rules: after event4 you may choose event3 again (3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...), avoiding event2 indefinitely.
- Because there is a valid sequence where event2 never occurs, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

(So C2 is not guaranteed true — answer: False.)

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" (which is equivalent to ""Event3 happens and event2 happens"", i.e. C2 ≡ C1)

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event3 happened. (So event3 occurs.)
- After event3, event4 must happen. => from initial event3 we must have event4 next.
- After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen. => from that event4 we may choose event2.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen. (no contradiction)

Step 3 — trace a valid sequence:
- Start: event3 (given).
- Then: event4 (required after event3).
- Then: event2 (allowed after event4).

This sequence contains both event3 and event2, so C1 holds. Since C2 requires event3 and C1, and both hold, C2 holds.

Final answer:
True"
