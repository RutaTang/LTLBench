- C1 states that event3 happens or event2 happens. Since event2 has happened, C1 is true in the initial state.
- Since no other events can occur after event2, there are no future states where C1 could be false. Thus, C1 remains true in all states (only the initial state exists).

The hypothesis states that C1: event2 does not happen, and C2: C1 eventually holds. This means that eventually, event2 does not occur in the sequence.

It is possible to have a sequence where, after the initial event2, the sequence enters a cycle between event3 and event4. For example:
- event2 → event3 → event4 → event3 → event4 → ...
In this cycle, event2 never occurs again after the initial event. Thus, C1 becomes true and remains true after a finite number of steps.

C2 claims that C1 does not hold, but since C1 is true, C2 is false.

No sequence of events can avoid event1 because the rules enforce that event1 occurs after event2, which occurs after event4. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen, both of which lead back to event1 (directly or via event3), ensuring that event1 continues to occur, but importantly, event1 does occur eventually from the start.

Initially, event3 has already happened, so C1 is false. Therefore, for C2 to be true, event2 must happen in all possible sequences of events after event3.

However, from the rules:
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- If event1 happens after event3, no other events can happen, so event2 does not occur.
- If event4 happens after event3, no other events can happen, so event2 does not occur.
- Only if event2 happens after event3 does event2 occur.

Since there are sequences (event3 followed by event1, or event3 followed by event4) where event2 does not happen, C2 is false in those sequences. Therefore, C2 is not true in all cases.

Thus, C2 is false.
