Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event4 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There is some future point at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Interpreted as the disjunction (event2 occurs now) OR (event2 occurs eventually). In practice this is ""either event2 already happens (in the current state) or event2 will happen at some point in the future.""

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial condition we have event1 now.
- By the rule “after event1 → event2 must happen,” event2 must occur immediately after the initial state. Therefore event2 does indeed occur in the future (in fact in the next step).
- Hence C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true.
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction in C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true as well. (Whether you interpret the first disjunct as “happens now” or “happens at some point” is irrelevant here because C1 is already true.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so event2 is true/occurs).

2) Transition rules (given as ""must happen"" implications)
- event2 → event4 (after event2, event4 must happen).
- event4 → event2 (after event4, event2 must happen).
- event1 → event4 (after event1, event4 must happen).
- event3 → (event2 ∨ event4) (after event3, either event2 or event4 must happen).

(Interpretation: ""A → B"" means: if A occurs, then B will occur subsequently.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e. (event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. event3 → (event1 ∨ event2).

4) How they relate / logical deduction
- From the rules, event3 → (event2 ∨ event4).
- From event4 → event2, whenever event4 happens a (subsequent) event2 will happen.
- Therefore if event3 leads to event4, that branch still leads to event2. So in every possible branch following event3, event2 will occur.
- Hence event3 → event2 (event2 is guaranteed after event3), and therefore event3 → (event1 ∨ event2) holds.

Also, independently, because event2 happened initially, C1 is already satisfied in the scenario. But crucially, C2 is entailed by the transition rules: whenever event3 happens, event2 (and thus C1) will happen afterward.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the run starts with event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (a choice: one of them must follow).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (a choice: one of them must follow).

I read “must” / “either … or … must” as a nondeterministic obligation: when an event happens the next event is constrained as above, but where a choice exists either option may be chosen.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting this as the claim that event2 occurs in every execution (i.e., event2 is inevitable / happens at some point in every possible run).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event4 happens.” Interpreting this as the implication: if event2 is inevitable, then event4 happens (i.e., in the run under consideration event4 will occur).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; truth-values
- Is C1 true? No. C1 is not guaranteed by the rules. A valid run that never contains event2 exists: start with event1 → (must) event4 → choose event3 → choose event4 → choose event3 → ... and so on alternating event4 and event3 forever. This sequence obeys all transition rules but never includes event2. Thus event2 is not inevitable, so C1 is false.

- Is C2 true? Yes. Even without assuming C1, event4 must happen because after the initial event1 the rule “after event1, event4 must happen” forces event4. So the implication “if C1 then event4” holds: whether or not event2 always happens, event4 is guaranteed by the initial rule. Therefore C2 is true.

Summary
- C1: false (event2 need not occur; there are admissible traces with no event2).
- C2: true (event4 is guaranteed immediately after the initial event1, so the implication holds).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: after the initial event1, event4 is forced by the rules, so regardless of whether C1 holds the implication ""if C1 then event4"" is satisfied."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happens first.

2) Transition rules
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: event4 must happen (i.e., event4 follows event2).
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
(One of the lines about ""after event4"" was repeated in the statement; it is the same rule.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event4 happens."" (A conjunction: both occur at some point in the run.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally: C1 → (event2 happens).

4) How they relate
- C1 explicitly asserts that event2 happens (since C1 = event2 AND event4). Therefore any situation in which C1 holds already satisfies ""event2 happens.""
- The implication C1 → event2 is therefore always true: whenever the antecedent C1 is true, the consequent (event2) is true by definition; if C1 is false the implication is vacuously true. So the conditional adds no new information.

Conclusion: C2 is True (tautologically true given the definition of C1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is ""event2 and event4."" That already entails event2, so the implication C1 → event2 is always true (and vacuously true when C1 is false)."

- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen (3 -> 1 or 2).
- After event1: no other events can happen (1 -> stop).
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen (2 -> 3 or 4).
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen (4 -> 1 or 3).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the tautological implication event1 -> event1, which is always true (it holds regardless of whether event1 actually occurs).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" Formally C2 is (C1 -> event4). It says: whenever the statement C1 is true, event4 is true (happens).

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- C1 is a tautology, so C1 is true.
- C2 is the implication (C1 -> event4). Since C1 is true, C2 is true exactly when event4 is true.
- The context gives that event4 happened initially, so event4 is true.
- Therefore C2 (C1 -> event4) is true (true implies true yields a true implication).

Conclusion: C2 is True.

- Start: event4 has happened.
- By the rule ""after event4 → event3"", event3 must happen next (or at least eventually).
- By ""after event3 → event1"", event1 must then happen. So event1 does occur — C1 is true.
- By ""after event1 → event2"", event2 must then happen. So event2 also occurs.
- By ""after event2 → (event3 or event4)"", the system returns to event3 or event4 and the same chain repeats.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (every execution starts with event1).

2) Transition rules
- After event2: the next event must be event1 or event3.
- After event1: the next event must be event3 or event4.
- After event3: the next event must be event1.
- After event4: no further events can occur (terminal).
(You repeated the ""after event3"" rule twice; it’s the same rule.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as “event1 occurs in every future step / in every continuation” (i.e., in every possible continuation, event1 keeps happening whenever you look). Another weaker reading would be “event1 occurs at least once in every execution” — I’ll note both below.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1.

4) How these relate and final reasoning
- From the rules, starting at the initial event1 we must choose either event3 or event4 next.
  - If we choose event3, the rules force event1 next, giving a repeating cycle 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → … in which event1 keeps happening.
  - If we choose event4, we get 1 → 4 and then termination (no further events), so event1 does not continue to occur after that point.
- Because there exists a valid continuation (1 → 4) in which event1 does not keep happening forever, the statement “event1 always happens” (interpreted as holding at all future steps / in every continuation) is false.
- Therefore C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold) is True.

Note: If you meant the weaker reading “event1 occurs at least once in every execution,” then C1 would be true (because the system starts with event1), and C2 would be false. The usual reading of “always happens” in this kind of ruleset is the stronger one used above, so C2 is True.

- After event3: no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4: no further events can happen (event4 is terminal).

(Notes: the “after event3/no other events” and “after event4/no other events” lines are repeated in the context but say the same thing.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Natural reading: in every possible execution (trace) of the system, event3 occurs (at least once).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Natural reading: the property C1 is true for the system — i.e., in every execution C1 holds. (Equivalently: “it is always true that event3 occurs in the execution” — this is just a meta-statement that C1 is true in every run.)

(If one instead reads “always” as “at every time instant” rather than “in every execution,” interpretations change; I address that below.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Because the system starts with event3 and event3 is terminal, every possible execution begins with event3 and then stops. There are no executions that do not contain event3.
- Therefore C1 (event3 occurs in every execution) is true.
- Since C1 is true for the system, “C1 always holds” (C2) is also true.

Conclusion: C2 is True (under the standard interpretation that “always” means “in every possible execution” / “for all runs”). 

Caveat: If you instead meant C1 to mean “event3 holds at every moment in time,” then that stronger reading would be false (event3 occurs at the initial moment but not at later moments because no further events occur). Under the usual trace/property reading used above, C2 is True.

Step-by-step answer.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (i.e., the execution starts in a state where event4 has occurred).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen. (This is stated twice; it’s redundant.)
- After event4, no other events can happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — there exists some future point (after the initial state) at which event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — event1 does not eventually happen.

(You mentioned C3 etc., but only C1 and C2 are given in the hypothesis.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Since the initial state already has event4 and the rule says ""after event4, no other events can happen,"" no subsequent events can ever occur after the initial state.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- So C1 (event1 eventually happens) is false, and C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True. Since event4 has already occurred and forbids any further events, event1 cannot occur later, so C1 is false and C2 is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened.

Step 2 — transition / postconditions (as given)
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (This makes event3 terminal.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 never occurs in the course of events.)
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds."" Given the initial condition, the first conjunct (event4 happens) is true, so C2 is equivalent here to C1.

Step 4 — how the rules relate and evaluation
- From the initial event4, the rules force one of two possibilities:
  1. event4 → event3. If event3 occurs right after event4, event3 is terminal so no further events (including event2) can happen.
  2. event4 → event1 → event3. If event1 happens after event4, the rule requires that event3 happens afterward; once event3 occurs it is terminal, so no further events (including event2) can happen.
- There is no rule that allows event2 to occur after event4 or after event1, and event3 ends the sequence. Thus in every possible continuation from the given initial condition, event3 occurs and then no more events occur; event2 never occurs.

Conclusion
- C1 (event2 does not happen) is true.
- C2 (event4 happens and C1 holds) is therefore true (event4 is given and C1 is true).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (this is the starting point).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
(“After event4, no other events can happen” is repeated in the statement.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event2 happens."" (C1 is true if at least one of event4 or event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Symbolically: C1 ⇒ event2. This is true only when either C1 is false or event2 is true; it is false exactly when C1 is true and event2 is false.

Step 4 — how they relate; truth values
- From the rules and the initial condition, the sequence of events is fixed: event3 happens, and then (by the rule after event3) event4 must happen, and after event4 nothing more can happen. So the actual trace is event3 → event4 and stops. In that trace event4 does happen and event2 does not.
- Therefore C1 (""event4 or event2"") is true (because event4 happens).
- C2 (C1 ⇒ event2) is false in this situation because the antecedent C1 is true while event2 is false. The trace event3 → event4 is a counterexample showing C2 does not hold.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.

(Notes: two rules in the context were repeated; I’ve listed each unique rule once.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — i.e. along the execution starting from the initial state, there is some future point where event2 occurs.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event4 happens” — interpreted as a implication: if event2 eventually occurs in the run, then event4 eventually occurs in that run.

Step 4 — how they relate; truth-values
- Because the initial event is event1 and event1 is terminal, no further events can occur in any execution that starts from the given initial condition. Therefore event2 never happens in any run starting from the initial state. So C1 is false.
- The implication “if C1 then event4” with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Therefore, relative to the given initial condition and rules, C2 is true.

A caveat (why this is vacuous): If you instead consider arbitrary runs not constrained to the given initial state (i.e., start from a state where event2 actually occurs), C2 would not be guaranteed — from event2 the system can transition to event1 immediately, preventing event4 — so in that broader sense the implication would be false. But under the provided initial condition (initially event1), C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: from the given initial condition event1 is terminal so event2 never occurs (C1 is false). An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C2 holds."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so the trace starts with event2).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" (i.e. the trace contains at least one occurrence of event3 or of event2.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting this as a global property: in every possible execution/trace of the system, C1 is true.

4) How they relate / reasoning
- The initial event2 has occurred. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" makes any trace that starts with event2 end there (no further events possible).
- Because every trace must begin with the given initial event2, every trace contains event2. Therefore every trace satisfies C1 (event2 ∨ event3).
- Hence C1 holds in all possible traces, so C2 (C1 always holds) is true.

(Notes on ambiguity: if one read ""always"" in a different temporal sense, the conclusion still holds — either there are no later states after event2, or the fact ""event2 happened"" is true for the trace — so C1 remains satisfied in every execution.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we take this as the current/starting state).

(Assumption: “eventually happens” refers to occurrence at or after the initial state. We also assume events are ordered in time and “after X, no other events can happen” means X is terminal.)

2) Transition rules
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3: no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2: event3 must happen next.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — there exists a (future) time from the initial state at which event2 occurs.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — event2 does not eventually happen.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- The initial state is event3, and rule “after event3, no other events can happen” makes the system terminal right away. No further events can occur after the initial event3.
- Therefore there is no possible future in which event2 occurs.
- So C1 is false, and C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

(If one allowed that event2 had already happened before the “initially event3 happened” statement or allowed simultaneous events, the answer could change, but under the usual interpretation above C2 is True.)

4) How the conditions relate (step-by-step reasoning)
- Start at event4 (given).
- From event4 either event2 or event3 must occur next.
  - If event2 occurs, then C1 (event2 or event1) is immediately true.
  - If event3 occurs, then by the rule after event3, event2 must occur next — so event2 will occur, making C1 true.
- Therefore in every possible case starting from the initial event4, event2 occurs at some point. Hence C1 is necessarily true.
- Since C1 is true, C2 = (C1 or event4) is also true. (Note additionally that event4 is true initially, so C2 would be true anyway.)

Answer: C2 is True.

True

Reason: event4 has already happened, so ""event4 happens"" is true, making C2 true immediately. Additionally, from event4 either event2 or event3 occurs; if event3 occurs it forces event2, so C1 (event2 or event1) is also necessarily true, which also makes C2 true."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially event2 happened (so the current/initial state has event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → next must be event2 or event3.
- After event2 → next must be event3.
- After event3 → next must be event2 or event4.
- After event4 → no further events (terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e. the event in the considered state is not event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the next state after the initial state should satisfy C1 (i.e. event1 does not occur in that next state).

4) How they relate / reasoning
- From the initial event2, the rule ""after event2 → event3 must happen"" forces the next state to be event3.
- That next state is event3, so event1 does not happen there. Therefore C1 is true in the next state.
- (Also, no transition rule allows event1 to occur at any later point given the initial event2, so event1 never occurs in this run.)

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (the system starts in a state where event1 has occurred).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event2: one of event1, event3, or event4 must happen next.
- After event1: one of event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event3: one of event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event4: event3 must happen next.
(One of the ""after event4"" lines is duplicated; the rule is the same.)

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally: event3 → event3. This is a propositional implication where the antecedent and consequent are identical.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: in every state (or along every execution/time), the statement C1 is true.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- C1 is a logical tautology: for any proposition p, p → p is always true. If event3 is true the implication is true; if event3 is false the implication is also true (false → false is true). Therefore C1 is true in every possible state, regardless of the transition rules or initial condition.
- Because C1 is true in every state, the claim C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true as well.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is the tautology ""event3 → event3"", which is true in every state; therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the current state s0, event4 happened (s0 |= event4).

2) Transition rules (what must happen in the next state after each event)
- After event1: next state must have event2.
- After event2: next state must have one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event3: next state must have one of {event1, event4}.
- After event4: next state must have one of {event1, event2, event3}.
(The repeated line about event4 is the same rule twice; it doesn't change anything.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" — formally, s1 |= event4.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" Interpreting this as (s1 |= event4) OR (s0 |= event4). Since we are given s0 |= event4, that second disjunct is true.

(If you intended a different timing for the second disjunct, say “event4 happens in some other state,” state that and I can re-evaluate; the natural reading given the context is the disjunction of next-state event4 (C1) with current-state event4.)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the rule “After event4 → next must be one of {event1,event2,event3},” starting in s0 with event4, the next state s1 cannot be event4. So C1 (s1 |= event4) is false.
- However, s0 |= event4 is true by the initial condition.
- Therefore C2 = (C1) OR (event4 in s0) = false OR true = true.

Answer: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: s0 |= event4 is given, so C2 = (s1 |= event4) OR (s0 |= event4) = false OR true = true. (If instead both disjuncts were meant to refer to the next state, C2 would be false, but under the stated reading C2 is True.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal)
- After event2, event1 must happen next. (event2 ⇒ event1 follows)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal)
- After event4, no other events can happen. (event4 is terminal)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (i.e., there is no occurrence of event2 in the execution)
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” (there exists a point in time from which C1 is true — equivalently, at some time onward, event2 never occurs)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Because event3 has already happened initially and rule “after event3 no other events can happen” makes the execution terminal, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- Therefore C1 is true right away (event2 does not happen).
- Since C1 holds immediately, it certainly “eventually holds.” Thus C2 is also true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must follow each event)
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2: event3 must happen next.
- After event3: event4 must happen next. (This rule was stated twice; it’s the same constraint.)
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen next.

These are obligations on what must occur after a given event; some choices are nondeterministic (e.g. after event1 you may get event2 or event4).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “event4 happens or event1 happens” (i.e. event4 ∨ event1).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” — there exists some time (now or in the future) at which C1 is true. (Standard temporal logic “eventually” allows the current moment; the upcoming reasoning also covers the case where “eventually” means strictly later.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- At time 0 event1 already happened, so C1 is already true at time 0. Therefore C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is true immediately.
- Even if you insist on a strictly later time, from event1 the rules force event4 to occur on every possible continuation: if after event1 the choice is event4, event4 occurs immediately; if the choice is event2 then event3 must follow and then event4 must follow, so event4 occurs a few steps later. Thus in every branch event4 occurs eventually, so C1 holds at some later time as well.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., at least once, at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen. (stated twice but same rule)
- After event3: event2 must happen. (stated twice but same rule)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” (i.e., event3 never occurs in the run)
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens.” That is, either event3 never occurs, or event1 occurs (somewhere). Because the problem explicitly says event1 happened initially, the disjunct “event1 happens” is satisfied.

Step 4 — how these relate and final evaluation
- Is C1 true? Not necessarily: there exist valid runs where event3 does occur (for example: event1 → event2 → event3 → event2 → …), so C1 is not guaranteed.
- Is C2 true? Yes. C2 is a disjunction: (event3 never occurs) OR (event1 happens). The second disjunct is true because event1 happened initially. Therefore the whole disjunction C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (the system starts in an event1 state).

Step 2 — transition rules (after each event, what may happen next)
- After event4: one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event2: one of {event1, event3} must happen. (this rule appears twice in the context)
- After event3: one of {event1, event2} must happen. (this rule appears multiple times)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as: at every step (now and in the future) the current event is event1.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this as: C1 ⇒ (event2 happens). (Usually read as: if event1 always holds, then event2 occurs.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final verdict
- From the rule ""after event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen,"" it is impossible for event1 to hold at two consecutive steps. Hence it is impossible for event1 to hold at every step. Therefore C1 cannot be true in any run compatible with the rules.
- Because C1 is impossible, the implication C1 ⇒ event2 is vacuously true in classical logic (an implication with a false antecedent is true). So C2 is True — but only vacuously: it does not give meaningful information because its antecedent C1 cannot occur under the given rules.

Short answer: C2 is True (vacuously), since C1 is impossible under the transition rules.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event1: event4 must happen.
- After event3: one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event4: no other events can happen. (Repeated statement — event4 is terminal.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" ≡ ""If event1 happens, then event2 does not happen.""

4) How they relate / reasoning
- Because event4 has already happened and event4 is terminal (no events can occur afterward), no further events (event1, event2, event3) can occur at all.
- Therefore C1 is true (event2 does not happen).
- C2 is an implication with antecedent ""event1 happens"". In the actual timeline event1 does not happen, so the implication is vacuously true. Even without vacuity: since any occurrence of event1 would force event4 (and event4 forbids further events), it cannot coexist with a later event2; but the key point is event1 cannot occur after the initial terminal event4.
- Conclusion: C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: Since event4 already happened initially and is terminal (no further events can occur), event2 does not happen (C1 is true). Therefore the implication ""if event1 happens then event2 does not happen"" is vacuously true in the actual timeline. (Also, by the rules, any occurrence of event1 would force event4 immediately, which prevents event2 from occurring afterward.)"

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at time 0 (the run starts at event1).

2) Transition rules (from each event, what must happen next)
- From event1 → either event2 or event3.
- From event2 → either event1, event3, or event4.
- From event3 → event4 (forced).
- From event4 → either event2 or event3.

(Several lines in the original were repeated; the above is the compact form.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Interpreting this in the usual temporal/logical sense, it means at every step of the execution (for all future times) the current event is event1.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” That is, it is not true that event1 occurs at every time step.

(Note: if someone instead meant “always happens” to mean “occurs at least once eventually,” that would be a different interpretation. Under that reading C1 would trivially hold here because event1 occurred initially. But the natural reading in this context is the global/“always” meaning used above.)

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because from event1 the next step must be event2 or event3, the very next time step cannot be event1. Therefore event1 does not hold at all time steps (it does not hold globally/always).
- In fact, a concrete run demonstrating failure of ""always event1"" is: 1 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... (once you go 1→3 you get stuck in the 3↔4 loop and never return to 1).
- Hence C1 (event1 always happens) is false, so C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” I.e., in the state immediately following the current one, event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the initial condition: event3 just happened. By the rule “after event3, event4 must happen,” the next state must contain event4.
- If we assume the model uses a single event per step (the standard reading here), the next state contains event4 and not event2. Therefore C1 (event2 does not happen) is true in that next state, so C2 is True.
- Note: if you allow multiple events to occur simultaneously in the “next state,” the rules do not forbid event2 also occurring alongside event4, so in that weaker interpretation C2 would be undetermined (not guaranteed).

Short answer: C2 is True.

I’ll go step-by-step as you requested.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start at event3).

2) Transition rules (what may/ must follow each event)
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3: event1 must happen (deterministic).
- After event4: event3 must happen (deterministic).

(You repeated the last two lines twice in the context; the meaning is as above.)

3) Interpretation of C1 and C2
- I interpret C1 (""Event4 always happens"") to mean: in every possible future sequence (every run compatible with the rules, starting from the initial state), event4 occurs at least once (i.e., event4 is inevitable).
- C2 is the negation: ""C1 does not hold"" means there exists some valid run starting from the initial state in which event4 never occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and the reasoning
- Start at event3. By the rules, after event3 we must have event1. So the sequence begins: 3 → 1 → ...
- After event1, we may choose event2, event3, or event4. In particular, choosing event3 is allowed. If we choose event3, the deterministic rule forces event1 next, so we can loop: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ...
- This infinite loop uses only events 3 and 1 and never uses event4. It is a valid run because every transition respects the rules.
- Since such a run exists (a run where event4 never occurs), event4 is not inevitable. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (the claim ""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Answering step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (i.e., at least one occurrence of event3 is given as a fact).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
  => These two rules force an alternating sequence (event3 → event4 → event3 → event4 → …).
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 occurs it terminates further events).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs it forces event3 afterwards).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This asserts that at least one of event1 or event2 occurs.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" This is the disjunction: either event3 occurs (somewhere) or C1 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and is C2 true or false?
- We have as a given fact that event3 happened initially. That makes the atomic statement ""event3 happens"" true.
- C2 is ""event3 happens OR C1"". A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since ""event3 happens"" is true, C2 is true regardless of the truth of C1.
- About C1: there is no rule or given fact forcing event1 or event2 to occur, so C1 is not entailed by the context (it may be false or simply unknown). But this does not affect C2 because C2 is already satisfied by event3.

Conclusion: C2 is True (because event3 happened).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start at a state immediately after event3).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

(Notes: the statements “After event3, event1 must happen” and “After event1, either event2, or event4 must happen” were repeated in the problem text but are the same constraints.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Two plausible readings:
  a) (Global reading) C1 means “event1 never happens (at any time in the future).”
  b) (Local/state reading) C1 means “at the current state, event1 is not the event that occurs right now.”
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” This means “at some future point C1 is true.” Under reading (a) this says “there is a future point from which event1 never happens” (i.e. eventually event1 never occurs). Under reading (b) it says “there is some future state in which event1 is not happening right then.”

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- Follow the transition rules from the initial state:
  - We start after event3. The rule forces event1 next. So event1 does happen immediately.
  - After that event1, we must go to either event2 or event4.
    - If we go event2, then event2 forces event3 next, and event3 then forces event1 again. That yields a cycle … -> event3 -> event1 -> event2 -> event3 -> event1 -> …
    - If we go event4, event4 forces either event2 or event3; either choice leads back into the same kinds of cycles that bring event1 back soon (e.g. event4->event3->event1 or event4->event2->event3->event1).
  - In every possible continuation from the initial event3, event1 occurs immediately and recurs infinitely often in all traces.

Conclusion about C2:
- Under the natural/global reading (C1 = “event1 never happens”), C1 is false (event1 does happen), and C2 (“event1 never holds eventually”) is false — you cannot reach a future point from which event1 never occurs because event1 already occurs and will continue to occur in the cycles.
- Under the local/state reading (C1 = “event1 is not happening at the current step”), C2 is true, because there are future states (for example, any state where event2 or event4 or event3 occurs) in which event1 is not the current event.

Which interpretation is intended? In temporal/specification problems like this the usual intended meaning of “Event1 does not happen” is the global one (“event1 never happens”). With that intended reading, C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (we start immediately after event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual sense for these problems: in every possible future run starting from the initial condition, event3 occurs (i.e., event3 is inevitable / will happen at least once).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e., there exists some possible run from the initial condition in which event3 does not occur.

Step 4 — how the rules relate and final answer
- Since we start with event4, and the rule says ""after event4, event3 must happen,"" every run must have event3 immediately after the initial event4.
- Example possible runs: 4 → 3 → 1 (terminates), 4 → 3 → 2 → 1, 4 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 1, etc. Every one contains event3.
- Therefore C1 (event3 occurs in every run) is true, and C2 (negation of C1) is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

(If instead ""always happens"" were read to mean ""holds at every timepoint forever"" — i.e., event3 occurs at every step — that would be a different interpretation and C1 would be false. With the standard “inevitably / will occur at some point” reading, C1 is true.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: no further events can happen (terminal).
- After event4: event3 must happen next.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e., there is no occurrence of event2.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., C1 is false; equivalently, event2 does happen.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- The context explicitly states that event2 did happen initially. That directly contradicts C1, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

(If one tried a different temporal reading of C1 — for example ""event2 does not happen after the initial moment"" — that is not stated in C1. Under the plain reading given, C2 is true because event2 did occur.)

I'll answer each part step by step and then state whether C2 must be true.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the start.

2) Transition rules (what must or may follow each event)
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen (a choice).
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen (a choice).
- After event3, event1 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" (i.e., no occurrence of event4 at any time)
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Equivalently, C2 = (event3 occurs at some time) OR (event4 never occurs).

4) How the conditions relate; is C2 true?
- From the initial event2, the next event may be 1, 3, or 4 (by the rule for event2).
- Two possible consistent futures show C2 can be either true or false:

  a) C2 true example: Choose event3 after the initial event2.
     Sequence: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...
     Here event3 occurs, so C2 is satisfied.

  b) C2 false example (counterexample): Choose event4 after initial event2, then repeatedly choose event4 after each event1.
     Sequence: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> ...
     This sequence is allowed by the rules (after 4 must come 1; after 1 you may choose 4). In this run event4 does occur and event3 never occurs, so both parts of C2 are false (event3 does not happen AND C1 does not hold), hence C2 is false in this run.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed to be true. It is satisfiable in some runs (true in some possible sequences) but it can be false in others (so it is not entailed by the rules and the initial condition).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> ... (after 2 choose 4; after 4 must be 1; after 1 choose 4 repeatedly). In this run event3 never occurs and event4 does occur, so C1 is false and event3 is false, hence C2 (event3 or C1) is false."

Step-by-step reasoning

- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.

- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen next.
- After event3, event2 must happen next.

- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” — i.e. the immediate successor state contains event1.
- C2: “Event3 happens or C1 holds” — i.e. either event3 occurs next, or event1 occurs next.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule “after event1 no other events can happen” applies, there is no allowed next event at all. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (event1 cannot occur in a next state because no next events are allowed).
  - “Event3 happens” is also false (no events can happen after the initial event1).
- Hence C2 = (event3) OR (C1) = False OR False = False.

Therefore C2 is False. (If “next state” were interpreted differently, please specify that interpretation; with the usual immediate-successor reading and the given rules, C2 is false.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" (A global implication: whenever event1 occurs, event4 also occurs somewhere in the timeline.)
- C2: ""Event4 happens OR C1 holds."" (At least one of those is true.)

4) How the rules determine truth values
- From the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event4 must happen,"" event4 will occur. So event4 happens in every allowed timeline.
- Since event4 happens, the disjunction in C2 (""event4 happens OR C1"") is satisfied regardless of whether C1 is true or false.
- (Note: with the given rules, event4 actually occurs before any possible event1, so C1 is also satisfied in the usual temporal reading — whenever event1 occurs, event4 has already occurred. But that extra point isn't needed to decide C2.)

Conclusion: C2 is True (because event4 happens).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)

- After event2: event1 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e., either event2 occurs at some point, or event4 occurs at some point (or both).

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule says ""after event1, event4 must happen"", event4 will happen at some future point. Therefore C1 is true.
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction ""event2 happens or C1 holds"" (C2) is true regardless of whether event2 ever occurs.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start at state ""2"").

2) Transition rules
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event4} must happen.
- After event3: event4 must happen.
- After event4: event1 must happen.
(The repeated line ""After event4, event1 must happen"" is redundant.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: along a run starting from the initial state, there will be a future step at which event1 occurs (i.e., the temporal formula F event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That is F(C1) = F(F event1). In linear temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is logically the same as C1.

4) How they relate / proof that C2 is true
- From the initial event2, consider each allowed successor:
  - If event1 is chosen immediately, event1 has happened.
  - If event4 is chosen, the rule ""after event4 → event1"" forces event1 on the next step.
  - If event3 is chosen, the rule ""after event3 → event4"" forces event4 next, which then forces event1 after that (3 → 4 → 1).
- Thus whichever allowed choice is made from event2, event1 will occur within at most two transitions. Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true from the initial state, and hence C2 (which is equivalent to C1) is also true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at the start, event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2: the next event must be event4.
- After event3: the next event must be one of {event2, event4}.
- After event4: the next event must be event1.
(The repetition of “After event4, event1 must happen.” has no additional effect.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” Interpreted as the proposition (event2 ∨ event1) holding at some point in time.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreted as ◇(event2 ∨ event1) — i.e., at some (possibly current or future) time, event1 or event2 occurs.

4) How these relate and conclusion
- The initial state already has event2 occurred, so C1 holds immediately at time 0.
- Since C1 already holds, “eventually C1” is satisfied (it is true now, so it is true that it eventually holds). Hence C2 is true.
- (Even under a strict “future only” reading that excludes the present: from the initial event2 we must go event4 next, then event1, so event1 will occur in the future — C1 will become true in the future as well. So C2 is still true.)

Optional extra: possible sequences
- Starting from event2: event2 → event4 → event1 → (event2 or event3 or event4) → ...
- If event1 → event2, you get the cycle event2→event4→event1→event2... so event1 or event2 recurs infinitely often.
- If event1 → event3, you get event3→(event2 or event4)→... which still leads back to event1 or event2.

Therefore C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (the system starts with event4).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen. (This rule is repeated but is the same rule.)
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen. (Also repeated.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" Interpreted as: in the execution being considered, no occurrence of event3 ever happens.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreted as: in every execution consistent with the rules, whenever event1 occurs in that execution, event3 never occurs in that same execution.

4) How they relate / evaluation of C2
- To decide whether C2 is true we must check if every allowed execution where event1 occurs has no event3.
- Counterexample (allowed by the rules): start at the initial event4 (given), pick event1 next (allowed after event4), then pick event3 next (allowed after event1). This yields a valid execution where event1 happens and then event3 happens. That execution makes C1 false (because event3 does occur), and thus makes the implication in C2 false for that execution.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules — it is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (because the rules permit a sequence event4 → event1 → event3, which violates C1 while having event1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start at event4, then take event1 (allowed after event4), then take event3 (allowed after event1). This sequence has event1 and also event3, so ""if event1 happens then event3 never happens"" is not guaranteed."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (i.e. the run starts with event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (after X, one of these must happen)
- After event3: either event1 or event2.
- After event1: either event3 or event4.
- After event2: either event1 or event4.
- After event4: event2 (the last rule is repeated but equivalent).

(So the transition graph is: 1 -> {3,4}, 2 -> {1,4}, 3 -> {1,2}, 4 -> {2}.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" — i.e. event3 never occurs in the execution.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event3 never occurs (equivalently, the implication (event2) → (no event3) must be true).

Step 4 — how they relate; counterexample
- From the initial event2 we can follow the allowed transitions: 2 → 1 → 3 is a legal sequence (2 can go to 1, and 1 can go to 3).
- In that sequence event3 does occur, so C1 is false.
- C2 is the implication ""if event2 then C1"". An implication is false exactly when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Here the antecedent is true (event2 did happen initially) and the consequent C1 is false (event3 does happen in the legal run above). Therefore C2 is false.

Conclusion
- C1 is false (there exist legal runs where event3 occurs).
- C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: starting from the initial event2, follow transitions 2 → 1 → 3. Here event2 occurs and later event3 occurs, so C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false in that run. The implication C2 (""if event2 happens then C1"") is therefore false (antecedent true, consequent false)."

- After event4 → next must be event1.
- After event1 → next must be event3 or event4.

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — this is just the conjunction of event3 with itself, so C1 is equivalent to ""event3 happens"" in a given state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the successor state to the current one, event3 must happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and verdict
- We start in S0 where event3 happened.
- By the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen,"" there is no successor state in which any event (including event3) occurs. Thus the next state does not have event3.
- Therefore C1 (event3) does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the initial state s0, event4 happened.

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""after X"" as the next state after X)
- After event4 → event3 occurs in the next state.
- After event3 → event2 occurs in the next state.
- After event2 → event1 occurs in the next state.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 occurs in the next state.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens"" — this is a property about a single state: it is true in a state if that state contains event3 or event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this asserts that in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Start: s0 (initial): event4 happened.
- By the rule ""after event4 → event3"", the next state s1 has event3.
- In s1, C1 (""event3 or event2"") is true because event3 happens there.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: s0 has event4, so by ""after event4 → event3"" the next state s1 contains event3; therefore C1 (""event3 or event2"") holds in s1, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1: event2 must happen.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.

(One of the ""after event2"" lines was repeated; they are the same rule.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens"" — i.e. at some point in the future one of these occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. neither event2 nor event3 ever happens.

4) How they relate (reasoning)
- Starting from event4, two cases from the rule after event4:
  - If event3 happens next, then C1 is immediately satisfied (event3 occurs).
  - If event1 happens next, then by the rule after event1, event2 must happen next; so C1 is satisfied (event2 occurs).

In both possible continuations from the initial event4, either event2 or event3 occurs. Therefore C1 is true, and C2 (its negation) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Starting from event4, the next event must be event1 or event3. If event3 occurs, C1 holds; if event1 occurs, then event2 must occur, so C1 holds. Thus C1 is true and C2 (its negation) is false."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen. (This was listed twice; treat as a single rule.)
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens."" This is redundant — logically equivalent to just ""event3 happens."" It asserts that event3 holds.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" In temporal terms this means “at some time (possibly now) event3 holds.”

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event3 has already happened initially, C1 already holds at the initial moment. Therefore C2 (""event3 eventually holds"") is true.
- Notes on semantics: under the usual temporal-logic interpretation of ""eventually"" (which allows the current moment), C2 is definitely true. If you insisted that ""eventually"" means strictly at some later time, then whether event3 reoccurs is not guaranteed on every possible future path (there are valid cycles 3→4→2→4→2… that avoid returning to 3), but a return to event3 is possible (e.g. 3→2→3). However, given the stated initial condition (event3 already happened), the standard reading makes C2 true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is the starting fact).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, the sequence stops; no event2, event3, or event4 can occur afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is also terminal.)
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen next.

Because event1 has already happened and it forbids any further events, in this particular scenario no event2, event3, or event4 can occur at any time.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally: event4 ⇒ event3.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" Formally: (event4 ⇒ event3) ∨ event3.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Given the initial condition and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event4 cannot occur. An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true, so C1 is true here.
- event3 does not happen (it is impossible after event1), but C1 is already true.
- Therefore C2 = (C1) ∨ (event3) is true ∨ false, which is True.

Answer: C2 is True.

True

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the system starts in a state immediately after event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event1 → event3 must happen. (1 → 3)
- After event3 → event2 must happen. (3 → 2)
- After event2 → either event3 or event4 must happen. (2 → 3 or 2 → 4)
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 must happen. (4 → 2 or 4 → 3)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" I interpret this as: in every possible run (continuation) from the initial condition, event1 will occur at some point (i.e., event1 is guaranteed).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" That is: in any run where event2 occurs, event1 will (still) be guaranteed to occur later (so the implication event2 ⇒ C1 must hold in all runs).

Step 4 — how the rules relate and evaluation
- There is no transition that leads to event1. None of the rules has an arrow to event1, so starting from event4 you can never reach event1 in any sequence.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 is not guaranteed; in fact it is unreachable).
- Event2 is reachable from the initial state: from 4 you can choose 4 → 2, so there exist runs where event2 does happen.
- In such runs (for example the simple run 4 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → …), event1 never occurs. Thus there exists a run where event2 is true but C1 is false, so the implication in C2 fails.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: start at event4 and take 4 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → … . Event2 occurs in this run but event1 is never reachable (no transition leads to event1), so C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false in that run, and thus the implication in C2 fails."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is the starting/initial event).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, one of {event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (This rule is listed twice in the context; it’s the same constraint repeated.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬event2).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e. (event2) ∨ (¬event2).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Logically, C2 is the disjunction event2 ∨ ¬event2, which is a tautology (the law of excluded middle). So C2 is always true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- Looking at the scenario-specific constraints: because event1 initially happened and after event1 no other events can happen, no further events (including event2) can occur in any allowed execution. So in this scenario C1 is true (event2 does not happen), and therefore C2 is true as well.

Therefore C2 is True (both by tautology and by the particular scenario).

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start in a state where event3 occurred).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.

(Interpreting ""after X, Y must happen"" as: once X occurs, Y will occur next / eventually; either interpretation gives the same result here because the rules form a deterministic cycle.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — i.e., from the current state, at some future point event1 will occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., if you move to the immediate next state from the current one, then from that next state it will be true that event1 eventually happens.

4) Relation and evaluation
- Start at event3. By the rule after event3, event4 must happen; then after event4, event1 must happen. So the execution trace from the initial state is: event3 → event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... . Thus:
  - C1 is true in the initial state (event1 does eventually occur).
  - The next state after the initial is the state where event4 has happened (or immediately before event4 if interpreted as ""next event is 4""); from that state event1 is still guaranteed to occur next (by the rule after event4). Therefore C1 also holds in the next state.

Hence C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts with event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meanings of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" (This is just a redundant way to assert that event1 happens.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This is ambiguous without a semantics for ""always"". Two natural readings:
  a) Temporal/invariant reading (LTL-style): ""C1 holds at every point in time / at every state"" (i.e. globally G C1).
  b) Trace/universal reading: ""In every possible run/execution, C1 holds (i.e. event1 happens in every execution).""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the rules and initial condition: since event1 has happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", the only possible execution is the single-step execution [event1] and then termination.
- Under the trace/universal reading (b): every possible execution contains event1 (indeed the unique execution does), so C1 is true in every execution, and hence C2 is True.
- Under the temporal/invariant reading (a): ""C1 holds at every point in time"" is false because C1 is an occurrence proposition true at the initial moment only; at later time points there are no events and C1 would not hold at those times. So C2 is False under this reading.

Conclusion (practical answer)
- If ""always"" means ""in every execution"" → C2 is True.
- If ""always"" means ""at every time/state (a global invariant)"" → C2 is False.

If you tell me which formal meaning of ""always"" you intended (temporal invariant vs. universal over runs), I’ll give a single definitive answer.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True — the system starts in event1 and event1 is terminal, so every execution contains event1; hence C1 holds in every run, so C2 is True (under the usual ""in every execution"" reading)."

Reason: Initially event1 occurs, but immediately after that the next event must be event2 or event4 (and if event4 happens it is followed by event2, after which no more events occur).

Short answer: C2 is True (C1 is false). Explanation step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so the system starts at event1).

2) Transition rules (restating and removing the duplicate lines)
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
(Notes: the rules “After event2 …” and “After event3 …” were repeated in the prompt; I treated each rule once.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event3 always happens” — interpreted as: along every possible future execution from the initial state, event3 occurs at least once (or possibly “infinitely often,” but the usual reading of “always happens” here is that it inevitably occurs eventually).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — the negation of C1; i.e., there is at least one possible execution from the initial state where event3 never occurs.

4) How the rules relate and the conclusion
- From the initial event1 we must go to event2 (by rule for event1).
- From event2 we can go to either event1 or event3.
- If the system repeatedly chooses the option event2 -> event1 -> event2 -> event1 -> …, then event3 never occurs. That infinite trace is consistent with all rules (and event4 is irrelevant because nothing forces event4 to occur).
- Therefore there exists a valid execution in which event3 never happens. So C1 (“event3 always happens”) is false, and C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is true.

Thus: C2 is True.

Summary answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (at the start). Also: once event4 has happened, no other events can happen thereafter.

2) Transition rules (given):
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- And: after event4, no other events can happen.

3) What the conditions mean:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event4 happens"" (both must be true at some points).
- C2: ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"" (a disjunction: true if event4 happens, or if both event1 and event4 happen).

4) How they relate and final evaluation:
- From the initial condition we know event4 happened. Therefore the disjunction in C2 is satisfied immediately, so C2 is true.
- C1 is not supported: because event4 happens initially and is terminal (no events can occur after it), there is no way for event1 to occur after that. The information does not state event1 happened before event4, so C1 is not entailed (C1 is false or at least not provable). But that does not matter for C2: since event4 is true, C2 is true.

Therefore: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (in the current state).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen next after each event)
- After event2 → next must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1 → next must be event4.
- After event3 → next must be event4.
- After event4 → next must be one of {event1, event3}.
(Three identical statements about after event4 are redundant; they say the same thing.)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e., the state immediately after the current one is event4.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" Interpreted naturally, this says: in the next state both event4 and event3 happen (i.e., C1 true AND event3 also happens in that same next state).

Step 4 — how these relate and truth value of C2
- From the rule ""after event3 → next must be event4"" and the fact the initial state is event3, the next state must be event4. So C1 is true.
- However, the model treats a single next state as a single event. The rules force the next state to be event4, so event3 does not also occur in that same next state. Therefore the conjunction in C2 (next state is both event4 and event3) is false.

Short conclusion
- C1 is True.
- C2 is False (unless you allow multiple events to occur simultaneously in one state; under the usual “one event per state” interpretation/C1’s meaning, C2 is false).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: the current state is event3, so the next state must be event4 (so C1 is true). C2 requires the next state to be both event4 and event3 simultaneously; under the usual one-event-per-state interpretation that is impossible, so C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens first.

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
(Note: the rule ""after event4, event3 must happen"" is repeated in the text but is the same constraint.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (i.e., ¬event3)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" Written logically: (¬event3) ∨ event3.

Step 4 — how the rules relate and truth values
- From the initial event2, the possible continuations are:
  - event2 → event4 → event3 (since after event4, event3 must happen), or
  - event2 → event1 → event3 (directly, if after event1 we choose event3), or
  - event2 → event1 → event4 → event3 (if after event1 we choose event4, that forces event3 next).
  In every possible branch starting from event2, event3 inevitably occurs. Thus C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
- Regardless of that, C2 is the disjunction (¬event3) ∨ event3, which is a logical tautology — it is true in every possible situation. So C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event3 must happen (event2 → eventually event3).
- After event3: no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4: event1 must happen (event4 → eventually event1).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreting naturally as the execution property ""event1 never occurs.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting as ""there is some point in time after which C1 is true"" — i.e., eventually it becomes the case that event1 will not occur any more (equivalently, from some point onward event1 never happens). If C1 already holds from the start, that also satisfies ""eventually C1 holds.""

4) How the rules relate to the conditions
- Because event3 has already happened initially and rule ""after event3 no other events can happen"" applies, the system cannot produce any further events at any later time.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time (it never happens). That makes C1 true.
- Since C1 holds immediately (and therefore from some point onward), C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (explicitly given).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
(Notes: the last rule is repeated in the text but means the same thing.)

From these rules, starting from event1, event4 will inevitably occur either immediately (if chosen after event1) or after event2 or event3 (since both force event4).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" (i.e., ¬event4)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" In logical form: C2 = (¬event4) ∨ event1.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- We know event1 is true (it happened initially). So C2 = (¬event4) ∨ true = true (an OR with a true disjunct is true).
- (Separately, because of the transition rules, event4 will in fact happen, so C1 is false. But that doesn't affect C2 since event1 is already true.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event4, one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" — this is just the same disjunction twice, so C1 is equivalent to ""Event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., ""Event3 does not happen.""

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the initial event1 and the rules: event1 → event2 (must), then event2 → event3 (must). So event3 does happen.
- Therefore C1 is true (event3 happens), and C2, being the negation of C1, is false.

Final: C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual meaning of ""next state"" = the immediate successor). Below are the steps.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules (read as ""if E happens now, then in the next state ..."")
- After event1 → event4 must happen in the next state.
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event2 → event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event3 → event1 must happen in the next state.
(You listed ""After event3, event1 must happen."" twice — that is redundant.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e. event1 holds in the immediate successor state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e. (event2 holds in the next state) OR (event1 holds in the next state).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Start at state0: event2 holds.
- By ""after event2 → event3"", state1 must have event3.
- By ""after event3 → event1"", state2 must have event1 (but that is one step later).
- So in the immediate next state (state1) we have event3. Therefore:
  - C1 (event1 holds in state1) is False.
  - ""Event2 holds in state1"" is False.
  - Thus C2 = (False OR False) = False.

Note/caveat: If by ""next state"" you meant ""at some future state (eventually)"" rather than the immediate successor, then event1 does occur (at state2) and both C1 (under that interpretation) and C2 would be True. But under the standard immediate-successor interpretation, C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so the sequence starts with event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen (i.e. a nondeterministic choice).
- After event3, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (a claim that event1 never occurs in the sequence).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 ⇒ (event1 does not happen). This is a universal conditional: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must not occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation of C2
- We start with event2 (antecedent of C2 is true at least once).
- The rules after event2 allow event1 as one possible next event. So there exists a valid trace: event2 → event1 → event4 → event2 → ...
  - In that trace, event1 does occur, so C1 is false.
  - Since C2 is the implication ""event2 ⇒ C1"", and we have a case where event2 occurs but C1 is false, the implication is false.
- Therefore C2 is false (because a valid sequence exists in which event2 happens and event1 also happens, violating C1).

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (i.e., event3 has occurred at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4: event1 must happen next.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (asserts that event3 never occurs)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., the negation of C1 — so C2 claims event3 does happen)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and evaluation)?
- The given initial fact explicitly states event3 happened. That directly contradicts C1, so C1 is false.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- The transition rules are consistent with the initial fact: event3 is terminal, so after it no further events occur; nothing in the rules rescues C1.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
(The duplicate line about event4 is redundant.)

I interpret each ""After X, Y must happen"" as a non‑deterministic next-step constraint: once X occurs, one of the specified next events must occur (and if several options are given, any allowed option may be chosen).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens"" — i.e. at some point in the execution either event1 occurs or event4 occurs (in fact, it is enough that event4 occurs).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — formally (event1 ∨ event4) ⇒ event1. This is equivalent to requiring that whenever event4 occurs then event1 also occurs (because if event1 already occurs the implication is satisfied; the only problematic case is event4 without event1).

4) How the conditions relate; need to decide truth of C2
- From the rules: initial event2 ⇒ (after event2) event4 must happen. So C1 is true (event4 does occur).
- But after event4, the rule allows either event2 or event3. If the choice repeatedly picks event2, the system can loop: event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → ... forever, never choosing event3, hence never reaching event1. That is an allowed execution under the given rules.
- Therefore there is a valid execution in which C1 holds (because event4 happens) but event1 never happens. That makes the implication (event1 ∨ event4) ⇒ event1 false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (counterexample trace: event2, event4, event2, event4, ... with no event3 and no event1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From initial event2 we must go to event4. After event4 we may choose event2 again, giving a permitted infinite trace event2, event4, event2, event4, ... in which event4 occurs (so C1 holds) but event1 never occurs. That is a counterexample to (event1 ∨ event4) ⇒ event1, so C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen. (stated twice but same rule)
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen. (stated twice but same rule)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" Interpreted as: whenever event1 occurs, event4 will occur (at some later point).
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" i.e. if event3 occurs, then the statement C1 (event1 ⇒ event4) is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the rules: event1 ⇒ (event2 or event4). And event2 ⇒ event4. Therefore in all cases after event1 an event4 will occur (either immediately or after event2). So C1 is true (interpreting C1 as “event4 occurs eventually after event1”).
- C2 says: if event3 happens then C1 holds. But C1 is already true unconditionally from the transition rules, so the implication ""if event3 then C1"" is true as well. Therefore C2 is true.

Note on interpretation: if C1 were read strictly as ""the immediate next event after event1 is event4"" (i.e. not allowing event2 in between), then C1 would be false (because event2 is also allowed next). Under that strict reading, C2 would be false unless there were additional rules tying event3 to that strict immediate-next property. Under the natural/eventuality reading used above, C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: From the rules, event1 ⇒ (event2 or event4) and event2 ⇒ event4, so event4 always occurs (possibly after event2) whenever event1 occurs, hence C1 is true unconditionally. Therefore ""if event3 then C1"" (C2) is true as well. (If C1 were read as ""immediate next event is event4"" the answer would differ; under the usual eventuality reading above, C2 is True.)"

- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.

2) Transition rules
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: no further events (terminal).
- After event1: event4 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" (¬E4).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens"" — i.e. (¬E4) ∨ E4. Note this is a logical tautology (a formula that is always true) because either E4 is false or E4 is true.

4) How the rules relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event2, the rule after event2 forces either event1 or event4 next.
  - If event2 → event1, then by the rule after event1, event4 must happen (event1 → event4).
  - If event2 → event4 directly, event4 happens immediately.
- In both possible branches starting from the given initial event2, event4 occurs. Therefore C1 (¬E4) is false in this system.
- C2 is (¬E4) ∨ E4, which is true in all cases (and also a tautology). Concretely here, since event4 does happen, C2 evaluates to true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the run starts with event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (what can happen after each event)
- After event4: the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- After event3: the next event must be either event1 or event2.
- After event1: the next event must be event2.
- After event2: no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

From these rules the possible finite runs starting from the initial event4 are:
- 4 → 2 (terminates)
- 4 → 3 → 2 (terminates)
- 4 → 3 → 1 → 2 (terminates)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1 as stated: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally this is the proposition (event3 → event3). That is a logical tautology: P → P is true for every valuation of P (true when P is true, and true when P is false). So C1 is true at every point in every run.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This asserts that at some time in the run C1 is true. Because C1 is true at every time (it is a tautology), it already holds at the initial time, hence it certainly holds eventually.

(If instead you meant a different property, e.g. ""if event3 happens then event3 happens again later"" — formally event3 → F(event3) — that is a different, nontrivial property. Under that reading C1 would be false in the run 4 → 3 → 1 → 2 because event3 occurs once and does not occur again. But that is not the literal reading of ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"".)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Under the literal reading of C1 as (event3 → event3), C1 is universally true (a tautology) in every state of every possible run given the transition rules.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true (indeed C1 holds immediately).

Final answer: C2 is True.

True

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (the current state is one where event4 occurred).

(Assumption: we are treating the system as a sequence of states where exactly one ""happened"" event labels each state, and ""after X"" refers to the immediately following state.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3 → event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen in the next state.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event4} must happen in the next state.
- After event4 → event1 must happen in the next state.
(The duplicate ""after event4, event1 must happen"" is the same rule repeated.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" Interpreted as: in a given state, event4 is false (the state is not labeled event4).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, in the immediate successor state, event4 does not happen.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- We start in a state where event4 happened. The rule ""after event4 → event1 must happen"" forces the next state to be event1.
- In that next state the event that happens is event1, so event4 does not happen there.
- Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True (given the usual sequential interpretation of ""after"").

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts in a state where event1 occurs).

2) Transition rules
- From event1: next must be either event2 or event3.
- From event2: no further events (terminal).
- From event3: next must be event1, event2, or event4.
- From event4: next must be event1.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally C1 is the implication (event2 → event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting ""eventually"" in the usual temporal sense (there exists some time point now or in the future where C1 holds), C2 says F(C1) — at some time C1 is true.

4) Relation and conclusion
- The formula (event2 → event2) is a logical tautology: P → P is always true. So C1 is true at every state (not just some states).
- If C1 is true now (and everywhere), then ""eventually C1"" is certainly true (it holds immediately). Therefore C2 is true.

(Notes: this conclusion assumes standard propositional/temporal semantics where implication is classical and ""eventually"" allows the current moment. Even under stricter interpretations the tautology holds at all reachable states, so C2 still holds.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we are in the state immediately after event3).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreting this in the natural way relevant here: C1 says that event1 never occurs (i.e., event1 does not happen at any time in the run).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That asks whether at some point in the future we reach a situation where C1 is true (equivalently: whether there is a future point after which event1 never occurs).

(If you meant a different formalization of C1/C2, the same core argument applies; I’ll use the “event1 never occurs” meaning.)

4) How the rules relate and conclusion
- From the initial event3, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur immediately after the initial state. So event1 does occur — C1 is already false.
- Once event1 occurs, the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternation 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → …, so event1 will occur again and again forever.
- Because event1 occurs already and will continue to occur infinitely often, there is no future point after which event1 never occurs. Therefore C1 never becomes true, and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Therefore C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules (given obligations)
- After event3: one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event4} must happen.
- After event2: event4 must happen.
- After event4: event2 must happen.
(Several of those last rules are repeated; they mean event2 and event4 force each other.)

Interpretation: “After X, Y must happen” means: whenever X occurs, Y will eventually occur.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” Formally: event1 → event2 (event2 occurs eventually whenever event1 occurs).
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds.” Formally: (event1) ∨ (event1 → event2).

4) How the rules make C1 and C2 true
- From the rules: event1 → (event2 or event4).
  - If event2 happens directly, then event2 holds — good for C1.
  - If event4 happens, the rule event4 → event2 forces event2 to happen afterwards.
  - Therefore in every case where event1 happens, event2 will eventually happen. So C1 is true given the transition rules.
- C2 is the disjunction “event1 happens or C1 holds.”
  - We already know event1 actually happened initially, so the left disjunct is true.
  - Also, as shown, C1 is true as well. Either way, the disjunction is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True. (Even if event1 hadn’t been given as initially true, C1 would still follow from the rules, so C2 would still be true because its second disjunct holds.)

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (call that the current state).

2) Transition rules (what must or may happen next)
- After event3: next event ∈ {event1, event2, event4} (one of these must happen).
- After event1: next event = event3 (event3 must happen).
- After event2: next event = event3 (event3 must happen).
- After event4: next event ∈ {event1, event2, event3}.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e. the immediate successor event is event4.)
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: whenever event3 occurs at some state, the next state has event4 (so after event3 the next event must be event4).

4) Relation and evaluation (is C2 true?)
- From the rule ""after event3: next ∈ {event1, event2, event4}"", event4 is only one allowed option, not the only option. So after event3 it is possible to have event1 or event2 instead of event4.
- Counterexample trace: initial event4 → choose next = event1 (allowed after event4) → next must be event3 (because after event1 event3 must happen). Now event3 has happened, but we can choose the following event = event1 (allowed after event3). That successor is not event4, so C1 is false in that situation. Therefore the implication in C2 fails (there exists a case where event3 happens and the next event is not event4).

Conclusion: C2 is False (it is not guaranteed by the given rules).

- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.

2) Transition rules
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).

- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" This is true if event3 occurs or if C1 is true.
(There is no C3 given in the problem.)

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation
- Since event2 happened initially and the rule “after event2, no other events can happen” makes event2 terminal, no other events can occur after it. With the usual temporal reading that initial = first, only event2 occurs in this scenario.
- Therefore event2 is true, event3 does not occur (in this scenario), but C1 (""event3 or event2"") is true because event2 is true.
- Given C1 is true, C2 (""event3 or C1"") is also true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened first.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event1 or event3.
- After event3 → either event1 or event4.
- After event4 → event3.
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the prompt; I've listed each unique rule.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (a global claim that event1 never occurs)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" More explicitly: whenever event2 occurs, event1 does not occur. (So C2 is equivalent to: there is no execution in which event2 occurs and event1 also occurs.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the rules we can produce a valid sequence where event1 does occur and event2 later occurs:
  - Start: event4 (given)
  - after event4 → event3 (forced)
  - after event3 → choose event1 (allowed)
  - after event1 → choose event2 (allowed)
  This yields … → event4 → event3 → event1 → event2 …
  In this execution event2 happens while event1 has happened (indeed event1 immediately precedes event2), so C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false in that execution.
- Because there exists a valid execution where event2 happens but C1 does not hold, the implication ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (call that state0).

2) Transition rules (what must follow each event)
- After event2: next state must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1: next state must be one of {event2, event3}.
- After event3: next state must be one of {event1, event4}.
- After event4: no further events (terminal).

(You repeated the rules for event3 and event4; they are the same as above.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e., from the current state, the next state is event2.)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" More explicitly: whenever event1 occurs now, the next state is event2.

4) How the conditions relate; truth values
- Is C1 true right after the initial event2? No. From initial event2 the allowed next events are event1, event3, or event4 — event2 is not one of them. So C1 is false in that situation.
- Is C2 entailed by the transition rules? No. After event1 the next state may be event2 or event3. Because event3 is allowed, event1 does not guarantee event2 in the next state. Thus C2 is false (counterexample: sequence event2 (initial) → event1 → event3 is allowed, and when event1 happened the following state was event3, so C1 did not hold).

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: from the initial event2 you may go to event1, and after event1 you may go to event3. That shows event1 does not guarantee that the next state is event2, so ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.

(“Must happen” here means the transitions are required, so starting from event1 we follow the required sequence.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens and event1 happens.” (Conjunction: both must be true.)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (Negation of C1: C2 is true iff C1 is false.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the rules and initial condition: event1 happened initially. Then by the rules event2 must happen, and then event4 must happen. So event1 is true and event4 is true, hence C1 is true.
- Because C2 is defined as the negation of C1, and C1 is true, C2 is false.

Final conclusion: C2 is False.

False

Reason: event1 is given true and the transition rules force event4 to occur, so C1 is true; C2 is the negation of C1, hence false."

- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the initial time).

Step 2 — transition rules

- After event1: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; under the usual reading it is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" So C2 says that eventually event1 will occur (i.e., at some future time C1 is true).

(If one tried to read C1 as requiring two distinct occurrences of event1, that interpretation will be noted below.)

Step 4 — how they relate / evaluation
- Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur immediately after the initial event2. Thus C1 (event1 happens) will hold at that next step.
- Therefore C2 (""event1 eventually occurs"") is true.

Additional note on the alternate interpretation (two occurrences): if C1 were read as requiring event1 to occur twice, that is also achievable: sequence event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 is allowed (after event1 you may choose event2, and after event2 event1 must occur), so two occurrences of event1 can happen as well.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has occurred (we start in a state immediately after event3).

2) Transition rules
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event4 must happen next.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen next (a nondeterministic choice).
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen next.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens."" Read as: from the current state, in every possible future execution (every possible continuation) there is some future step at which event4 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Read as: in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true (i.e., from that next state, event4 will eventually occur).

(If you intended a different semantics for ""eventually"" or ""next""—for example existential vs. universal path quantifiers—note below; with either common reading the result is the same.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
Start from the initial state (after event3). From event3 the next step must be either:
- event4, or
- event2.

- If the next step is event4, then event4 has already happened (so ""event4 eventually happens"" is immediately true).
- If the next step is event2, the rule ""after event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 at the following step, so event4 will happen (within one more step).

Thus from the initial state, in every possible continuation event4 does occur at or before two steps out. So C1 is true in the initial state.

C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state. Check both possible immediate next states:
- Next = event4 state: C1 holds (event4 already occurred).
- Next = event2 state: C1 holds (event4 is forced next).

Therefore C1 holds in every immediate successor, so C2 is True.

(If you meant “there exists a next state” rather than “for all next states,” C2 is also true here because both successors satisfy C1.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: From the initial (post-event3) state the next state is either event4 or event2; in both cases event4 occurs (immediately in the event4 successor, and forced after event2), so C1 holds in every immediate successor."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (i.e., every run/trace starts with event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (the next event after event1 is event2).
- After event2, the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” (Two plausible readings — I’ll state both.)
  - Reading A (strong/global): At every step/time point in every possible run, the current event is event1 (i.e., event1 holds at all times).
  - Reading B (existential/occurrence): In every run, event1 happens at least once.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” That is simply the negation of C1 under whatever reading we adopt.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Under Reading A (the natural reading of “always happens” = globally true at all times): C1 is false. Reason: the trace begins with event1, but the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” forces the next event to be event2, so event1 is not true at that next step. Thus event1 is not true at every time point, so C1 fails. Therefore C2 is true.
- Under Reading B (weaker: event1 happens at least once in every run): C1 is true, because the initial condition guarantees event1 happened at the start of every run; therefore C2 would be false under this interpretation.

Conclusion (most likely intended): Interpreting “always happens” in the usual/global sense (Reading A), C1 is false and so C2 is True. If you meant the weaker “happens at least once” reading, then C2 would be False.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (so event4 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules (what must follow each event)
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
(Notes: the context repeats the rules for event4 and event3, but they are the same rules above.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event4 happens."" Read as: at some point event1 occurs and (somewhere, possibly initially) event4 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" In other words, C2 = ¬C1: it says it is not the case that both event1 and event4 occur.

4) How they relate (can we decide C2 given the context?)
- event4 is true (given). So the ""event4 happens"" part of C1 is satisfied.
- From the rule after event4, event1 is one of the allowed next events, so there exists a valid execution in which event1 does occur (e.g. initial event4 → event1). In that execution both event4 and event1 happen, so C1 is true in that execution.
- But the rules are nondeterministic (""either ... or ... must happen""), so there also exist valid executions in which event1 never occurs (for example: initial event4 → event2 → event4 → event2 …), so in those executions C1 is false and hence C2 is true.

Conclusion
- The information does not force C1 to be true nor force it to be false. Both C1 and its negation are satisfiable by some allowed executions. Therefore, given only the context, C2 is not deterministically True or False — it is undetermined (i.e., not entailed; both C1 and C2 are possible in different valid runs).

False.

- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

- C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction and is equivalent to ""Event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" So C2 is true if either C1 is true or event1 is true (or both).

- Since the initial condition states event3 happened, C1 is true.
- Because C1 is true, the disjunction in C2 (C1 OR event1) is true regardless of whether event1 happens.
- Therefore C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
1. After event2, event3 must happen.   (event2 → event3)
2. After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.   (event3 → (event2 ∨ event4))
3. After event4, event2 must happen.   (event4 → event2)
4. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.   (event1 → (event2 ∨ event3))

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event4 happens""  (event3 ∨ event4).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ¬(event3 ∨ event4) which is equivalent to (¬event3 ∧ ¬event4).

Step 4 — how they relate and final determination
From the initial condition and rule 4: since event1 happened, either event2 or event3 must happen.

- Case A: if event3 happens directly, then C1 (event3 ∨ event4) is true.
- Case B: if event2 happens (the other option), rule 1 requires event3 to happen next. So event3 happens in this case as well.

Thus in all possible continuations starting from event1, event3 necessarily happens. Therefore C1 is true (because event3 is true), and C2 (the negation) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From event1 we have event2 ∨ event3. If event3 occurs, C1 holds. If event2 occurs, rule 1 forces event3, so C1 still holds. Thus event3 (and hence event3 ∨ event4) must happen, so C1 is true and C2 (its negation) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen (3 → {1,2}).
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen (2 → {1,4}).
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen (1 → {2,4}).
- After event4: event2 must happen (4 → 2).

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event4 happens.” Interpreting this in the usual temporal sense: whenever event1 occurs, event4 must occur at some (possibly later) time after it. (If you meant a different reading, please say so.)
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreting this to mean: at some future point onward, the implication of C1 becomes true (i.e., there is a time after which every occurrence of event1 is followed by an event4).

Step 4 — how the rules relate to the conditions; counterexample
- From the graph of allowed transitions we can follow a legal infinite run:
  3 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ...
  This run respects all rules: after 3 we chose 1; after each 1 we chose 2 (allowed); after each 2 we chose 1 (allowed). No event4 ever occurs in this run.
- Along this run, event1 happens repeatedly but event4 never happens after those occurrences. Thus C1 is false on this run (there are occurrences of event1 not followed by any event4).
- Because there exists a legal run where C1 never becomes true, C1 is not guaranteed, and C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is false (you cannot guarantee that at some point from which on every event1 is followed by event4).

Conclusion
- C2 is False (there is a valid infinite behavior 3 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... that violates C1 forever).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
These rules form a deterministic cycle: event1 → event2 → event4 → event3 → event1 → …, repeating forever.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens."" (A state/formula true at a time if either event1 or event4 occurs at that time.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (There exists some time in the future — including now — at which C1 is true.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and answer
- Because event1 happens initially, C1 is already true at time 0 (the ""event1"" disjunct holds).
- Therefore C1 holds immediately, so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.
- Moreover, because of the cycle, event1 and event4 will occur repeatedly, so C1 holds infinitely often.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (at least once, at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (after each event what must happen next)
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
(Note: a couple of these were repeated in the statement but add no new constraints.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens."" Because event3 already happened initially, C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens at some point (in the execution).""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Given the initial event3, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 does not happen (at any point).""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the final answer
- From the rules, after the initial event3 you may choose event1 next, giving a sequence like: event3 → event1 → ... In that case event1 does happen, so C1 is true and C2 is false.
- But you may instead choose event2 after event3, forcing event4 next, and then repeatedly choose event2 from event4, producing a sequence that never includes event1: event3 → event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → ... In that case event1 never happens, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

Therefore C2 is not determined by the rules alone: there are valid sequences where C2 is true and valid sequences where C2 is false. Conclusion: C2 is satisfiable (can be true) and also refutable (can be false); it is undetermined / neither entailed nor contradicted by the given information.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Explanation: The rules allow runs both with and without event1 (e.g., event3 → event1 … versus event3 → event2 → event4 → event2 …). C2 (""event1 does not happen"") is not guaranteed by the premises, so it is not true in all valid sequences."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1, one of {event3, event4} must happen.

(From the initial event4 we can already deduce that event3 will happen next, because “after event4, event3 must happen.”)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “If event3 happens, then event3 happens.” Formally C1 is event3 → event3. In propositional logic this is a tautology (always true): any proposition implies itself.
- C2: “Event2 happens or C1 holds.” Formally C2 is (event2) ∨ C1.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C2
- Since C1 is a tautology (event3 → event3 is always true), C1 holds regardless of whether event3 actually occurs.
- Therefore C2 = event2 ∨ C1 = event2 ∨ True = True.

Conclusion: C2 is True. (Independently, from the transition rules we also get that event3 will occur after the initial event4, but that fact is not needed because C1 is already a logical tautology.)

Reason: Assume C1 holds, so from the initial event2 we must have event3 (2 -> 3). From event3 the rules allow either event1 or event4. Pick event1.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the initial (current) state, event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 → event2 must happen next.
- After event2 → either event3 or event4 must happen next.
- After event3 → event1 must happen next.
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 must happen next.

So a possible prefix of runs is:
s0 (event1) → s1 (event2) → s2 (either event3 or event4) → …

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “If event3 happens, then event4 happens.” Interpreted as a propositional implication evaluated in a single state: (event3) → (event4) in that state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: in the immediate successor state (the state after the initial one, i.e. s1), the formula C1 is true.

(If one instead intended C1 as a temporal claim “whenever event3 occurs then later event4 occurs,” that is a different reading; I address that below.)

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The next state s1 (after the initial s0) is the state where event2 happens (by the rule after event1).
- In s1, event3 is false (event2 occurs instead), so the implication (event3 → event4) is vacuously true in s1.
- Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True under the usual propositional reading of C1.

Note about the alternative (temporal) reading:
- If C1 were meant as “whenever event3 occurs then an event4 will happen (later),” then C1 is not guaranteed by the transition rules (after event3 you must go to event1, then event2, and from event2 you may or may not choose event4). Under that temporal reading, C1 is not generally true, and so C2 (that that temporal C1 holds in the next state) would be False. 

Final answer: Under the standard propositional reading of C1, C2 is True (vacuously true in the next state). Under a stronger temporal reading of C1, C2 would be False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the next state after the initial event1 is the state where event2 holds, so event3 is false there; the propositional implication (event3 → event4) is therefore vacuously true in that next state."

- After event3: event2 must happen next.
(One rule was duplicated in the description: ""after event3, event2 must happen"" appears twice.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Interpreted as: at a given point, either event2 or event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted as: at some later point in the execution/run, C1 becomes true (i.e., eventually either event1 or event2 will occur).

Step 4 — how the rules imply C2 (case analysis)
Starting from the initial event4, the rule for event4 forces one of two next events:
- Case A: event4 → event2. Then event2 has occurred immediately, so C1 is true at that point.
- Case B: event4 → event3. Then the rule for event3 forces event2 next: event3 → event2. So event2 occurs in the next step, and C1 is true then.

In every possible branch from the initial state, event2 occurs within at most two steps. Therefore C1 becomes true in every possible run, so ""eventually C1 holds"" is satisfied.

Conclusion
C2 is True (in fact, C1 becomes true on every possible execution starting from the given initial condition).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: From the initial event4, either event2 occurs immediately or event3 occurs and then (by the rule after event3) event2 occurs next. Thus event2 (hence C1) occurs within two steps in every run, so C2 holds."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (the system starts at event3).

2) Transition rules
- After event3: one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen next.
- After event1: event3 must happen next.
- After event2: event4 must happen next.
- After event4: one of {event1, event2} must happen next.

(One rule was repeated; it is the same constraint.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to simply ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ""Event2 does not happen.""

4) How they relate and final answer
- Event2 is not forced by the rules. From the initial event3 you may choose event2, but you may equally choose event1 or event4.
- Example where C2 is true (event2 never happens): 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (always pick event1 after event3; this obeys the rules and never produces event2).
- Example where C2 is false (event2 does happen): 3 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 2 → ... (choose event2 at some step; the subsequent choices follow the rules).

Conclusion: C2 is not universally true nor universally false. It is satisfiable (there exist valid executions where C2 holds) but not entailed by the system (there also exist valid executions where C2 is false).

False

- Initial condition: event4 happens initially (i.e., at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.

(These say what must occur next whenever a given event occurs.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally C1 is event3 → event3. This is a logical tautology (always true) — it holds regardless of whether event3 actually occurs.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Formally C2 is event2 ∨ C1. This is true if either event2 happens or C1 is true.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and is C2 true?
- C1 is always true (tautology). Therefore the disjunction C2 = event2 ∨ C1 is necessarily true (true ∨ anything = true).
- Independently, from the rules and the initial condition: event4 happens initially and ""after event4, event2 must happen,"" so event2 will also occur — which also makes C2 true by the other disjunct.

- Therefore C2 = (C1 ∨ event2) is true regardless of whether C1 is true or false (a disjunction with a true disjunct is true).

Answer up front: You cannot conclude C2 is definitely true from the given information. Whether C2 holds is undetermined (it depends on an extra modelling assumption). Below is the step‑by‑step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it S0) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event1 must happen (so if event3 holds in some state, event1 holds in the next state).
- After event1, event3 must happen (if event1 holds now, event3 holds next).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 holds now, event1 holds next).
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen (if event4 holds now, next state must have event1 or event3).

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” Interpreting “next state” as the state immediately after the initial state S0, C1 says event4 holds in S1.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” So C2 is the claim that event4 does NOT hold in S1 (i.e. ¬C1).

4) How do these conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- From S0: event2 holds. By the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” S1 must have event1.
- By the cycle rules, S2 must have event3, S3 must have event1, etc. So we get a required infinite alternation of event1 and event3 starting at S1 (1,3,1,3,...).
- BUT nothing in the given rules forbids event4 from also happening in S1, and nothing forces event4 to happen in S1 either.

Conclusion:
- If you assume events are mutually exclusive (exactly one event per state), then S1 must be event1 alone, so event4 cannot happen in S1. Under that assumption C1 is false and C2 is true.
- If you allow events to co‑occur in a state, the rules do not determine whether event4 occurs in S1: both possibilities (event4 happens in S1, or it does not) are consistent with the rules. Under that assumption C2 is not provable (it may be true or false depending on the allowed model).

So without an extra assumption about exclusivity of events, C2 is undetermined (not necessarily true). If you want a definite True/False answer, tell me whether events are exclusive; with exclusivity C2 = True, without exclusivity C2 is Undetermined.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the given rules you cannot conclude ¬C1 (event4 does not occur in the next state) without an extra exclusivity assumption, so C2 is not guaranteed true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen next.
- After event2, one of {event3, event4} must happen next.
- event3 is terminal: after event3 no further events can happen.
- event4 is terminal: after event4 no further events can happen.
(These rules allow nondeterministic choices at the branching points.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens” (i.e., at some point in the future an occurrence of event3).
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds” (logical disjunction: event1 ∨ C1).

Step 4 — how they relate and final conclusion
- From the transition rules the possible execution sequences are:
  - event1 → event3
  - event1 → event4
  - event1 → event2 → event3
  - event1 → event2 → event4
  So event3 happens in some runs (those ending in event3) but not in all (runs ending in event4).
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed true (it may be false in the runs that go to event4).
- However, event1 is given as true initially. That makes the disjunction event1 ∨ C1 true regardless of whether C1 holds.

- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., throughout the considered execution/run, event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Logically, C2 = (not event1) OR (event1).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- (not event1) OR (event1) is a classical tautology (the law of excluded middle). No matter whether event1 actually occurs in a run, one of the disjuncts is true, so C2 is true.
- Examples:
  - If we take the run 3 → 1, then event1 happens, so C1 is false but ""event1 happens"" is true → C2 true.
  - If we avoid event1 by looping 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → …, then event1 never happens, so C1 is true → C2 true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (after X, what must/can happen)
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event1 must happen (so event2 → event1 → end).
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen (one of them must occur after event3).
- After event4: event2 must happen (so event4 → event2 → event1 → end).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" (i.e., in the ongoing sequence/event history, event4 never occurs.)
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" Given the initial condition that event3 already happened, C2 is equivalent here to ""event4 does not happen.""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the final answer
- Because after event3 either event2 or event4 must occur, there are two allowed continuations:
  - Option A: event3 → event2 → event1 (then stop). In this option event4 does not happen (C1 true), so C2 is true.
  - Option B: event3 → event4 → event2 → event1 (then stop). In this option event4 does happen (C1 false), so C2 is false.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. It is satisfiable (true in some possible continuations) and falsifiable (false in others). The correct characterization: C2 is contingent/undetermined — possibly true but not necessarily true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: After event3 either event2 or event4 must occur. The continuation event3 → event4 → event2 → event1 is allowed, in which event4 does happen, so C1 (""event4 does not happen"") is false and hence C2 is false. C2 is therefore not guaranteed (it's contingent)."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.

(These are nondeterministic choices where specified, but the “must” constraints hold.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — i.e., at some time now or in the future event2 occurs.
- C2: “Event4 happens or C1 holds” — the disjunction event4 ∨ (event2 eventually happens).

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Because event2 has already happened initially, C1 is true (event2 has indeed occurred).
- Also, by the rule “after event2, event4 must happen,” from the initial event2 an event4 occurrence is required at some subsequent point — so event4 will happen as well.
- Therefore both disjuncts of C2 are satisfied (in fact event4 will occur and C1 holds), so C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 has already happened, so C1 holds; therefore the disjunction in C2 (event4 ∨ C1) is true."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1: event3 must happen next.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen next. (This rule appears twice but is the same constraint.)
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted as: given the current state, the next state is event1.
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreted as: whenever event3 occurs now, the next state must be event1 (i.e., event3 → next = event1).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the transition rules, when event3 happens the next state may be event1 OR event4 (the rule explicitly allows either).
- Therefore C1 (next = event1) is not guaranteed whenever event3 happens; event4 is a permitted alternative.
- Counterexample run: initial event1 (given) → next must be event3 (by after event1 rule) → choose event4 next (allowed by the after event3 rule). At that moment, C1 is false because the next state after event3 was event4, not event1.

Hence C2 is false. (It would only be true if the rule ""after event3"" were strengthened to force event1 rather than allowing event4.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

- After event2: next must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.

(Notes: the context repeats some statements, but the effective transition graph is as above.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreted as: in the whole execution/sequence, event1 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" That is, either event1 never occurs, or event2 occurs at some point (or both).

Step 4 — how they relate; truth-value of C2
We check whether C2 must be true given the rules, or whether it can be false.

- Example where C2 is true: choose the immediate allowed continuation event4 after the initial event3. Sequence: [event3, event4]. Here event1 never occurs, so C1 is true, hence C2 is true.

- Example where C2 is false: choose event1 after the initial event3, then choose event4 (allowed after event1). Sequence: [event3, event1, event4]. In this run event1 does occur (so C1 is false) and event2 does not occur. Thus ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" is false in this run (neither disjunct holds), so C2 is false.

Conclusion
C2 is not determined by the given rules: there are valid sequences where C2 is true and valid sequences where C2 is false. In logical terms, C2 is satisfiable but not entailed by the premises.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (every execution starts with event1 having occurred).

Step 2 — transition/obligation rules
- After event1, event4 must happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, event4 must occur later).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, it must be followed by event1).
- After event3, event4 must happen (if event3 occurs, it must be followed by event4).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" — there is an execution in which event3 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — in every possible execution consistent with the rules, event3 never occurs (i.e., event3 is impossible in all traces).

Step 4 — how they relate; is C2 true?
- Nothing in the rules forbids event3 from occurring before event4. The rules only require that whenever event1 (which already occurred) or event3 occurs, event4 must eventually happen, and that once event4 happens nothing else may occur.
- A valid execution that violates C1 is: event1 (initial) → event3 → event4 → stop. This respects:
  - After event1: event4 does occur later (via the final event4).
  - After event3: event4 does occur.
  - After event4: no further events.
  - event2 never occurs, so its rule is irrelevant.
- Since there exists a valid execution where event3 does happen, C1 is not guaranteed, and therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

(If you intended ""after X must happen"" to mean ""immediately next"" rather than ""eventually,"" the answer could change; with immediate-next semantics event3 would be impossible and C2 would be True. Under the usual eventuality reading above, C2 is False.)

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially event1 has occurred.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen next.
- After event3, event1 must happen next. (This rule is stated twice but is the same constraint.)
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""event3 happens and event4 happens"" (i.e., both occur at some point in the run).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not the case that both event3 and event4 occur).

4) How they relate / evaluation of C2
- C1 is possible under the rules. Example valid run showing both event3 and event4:
  event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> event2 -> event4.
  This respects all rules (after each event the allowed next events are chosen accordingly, and event4 ends the run).
- C1 is also avoidable (there are valid runs in which event4 never occurs, or event3 never occurs). Example run avoiding event4:
  event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> ... (looping between event3 and event1 forever, never hitting event2→event4).

Therefore:
- C1 is satisfiable (can be true in some allowed sequences) and also not forced.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is neither universally true nor universally false: it can be true in some runs and false in others.

If you must pick a single label: C2 is not entailed by the premises (i.e., it is not necessarily true). In plain terms: C2 can be True in some possible executions and False in others.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (both event3 and event4 occur) is possible under the rules (e.g., event1 → event3 → event1 → event2 → event4), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially: event2 happened (current state has event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → event4 must happen next.
- After event4 → event3 must happen next.
- After event3 → next must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event2 → no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; there is no next event).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event4 happens"" — a proposition true in any state where either event2 or event4 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the proposition C1 is true in the immediate successor state (the state after one transition).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- In the initial state C1 is true (because event2 happened).
- But by the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"", there is no successor state with an event occurring. Under the usual interpretation of ""next state"" (X), if there is no successor state the X-formula is false.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state (there is no next event that could be event2 or event4), so C2 is false.

Note: If you adopt a nonstandard semantics that treats a terminal state as repeating itself indefinitely (stuttering), then C2 could be true (if the terminal state is taken to still satisfy event2). Under the standard interpretation where ""next"" requires an actual successor event, C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (so at least one occurrence of event4 is given).

2) Transition rules (interpreted as ""after X happens, at least one of the following must happen next"")
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (at least one of those).
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., either event3 occurs at least once, or event2 never occurs).

4) How the rules relate and truth values
- From the initial event4 and the rule ""after event4, event3 must happen"", we can conclude event3 does happen. That alone makes the disjunction in C2 true.
- About C1: event2 need not happen (there is a possible run event4 → event3 → event4 → event3 → … with no event2), but it is also possible to choose the other option after event3 and have event2 occur (event4 → event3 → event2 → …). So C1 is not entailed and is undetermined (could be true in some runs, false in others).
- Regardless of whether event2 ever occurs, event3 does happen (forced by the initial event4), so C2 is necessarily true.

Final answer: C2 is True (necessarily true). C1 is not determined (not guaranteed).

True

Step 1 — Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (so we are at a state immediately after event4).

Step 2 — Transition rules (restated)
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen (i.e., next state(s) after event1 include event2 or event3).
- After event2: event1 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event4: event1 must happen.

Step 3 — What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Given the rule “After event4, event1 must happen,” and the initial fact that event4 just happened, C1 asserts the mandatory next-state event following that initial state.
- C2: “Event2 happens or C1 holds.” This is a logical disjunction: C2 is true if either event2 occurs in the next state or C1 is true (i.e., event1 occurs in the next state).

Step 4 — How they relate and truth values
- From the rule “After event4, event1 must happen” and the initial occurrence of event4, C1 is true (event1 must happen next).
- C2 is “event2 happens OR C1 holds.” Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 actually happens.

- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 occurs at least initially).

- After event3 → either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2 → event4 must happen.
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 must happen. (Stated twice; same rule.)
- After event1 → event3 must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Logically, C2 = not(C1) = ""Event2 does happen.""

4) Relation and conclusion
- Because the initial condition states event2 happened, C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 = not(C1) is true.

So C2 is True (given the usual reading that C1 asserts event2 never occurs).

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition given: event3 happened initially (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen next.
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event4, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
(One rule was repeated but it is the same: event2 → event1.)
So the possible runs starting from the initial event3 are:
- event3 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (1↔2 loop), or
- event3 → event4 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (then the same 1↔2 loop).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Interpreted in the usual sense, this asserts that event3 occurs in all relevant times/runs (i.e., it is true in every state or every execution, not merely initially).
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” That is the negation of C1: it asserts that it is not the case that event3 always happens.
(There is no C3 defined in the problem statement.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and conclusion about C2?
- We only have evidence that event3 happened initially. No rule forces event3 to occur again later, nor forces it to occur in every run; the rules only force transitions from event3 to other events. Therefore the universal claim “event3 always happens” (C1) is not supported and should be considered false.
- Since C2 is the negation of C1, and C1 is false, C2 is true.

Therefore: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happens (so the system starts with event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen next.
- After event2: event3 must happen next.
- After event3: one of {event1, event2} must happen next. (This rule is listed twice but is the same rule.)
- After event4: event2 must happen next.
These are non-deterministic branching rules (where “either/or” means one of the listed events may occur).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event4 happens or event4 happens.” This is logically equivalent to simply “Event4 happens” (the disjunction is the same literal twice).
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” In other words, C2 asserts: whenever event1 happens, event4 happens (event1 → event4).

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- C2 would be true only if every possible scenario in which event1 occurs is one in which event4 also occurs (event4 must follow sometime).
- But we can exhibit a valid run consistent with the rules in which event1 occurs and event4 never occurs:
  - Start: event2 (initial).
  - After event2 → event3 (forced).
  - After event3 → choose event1.
  - After event1 → choose event2 (allowed).
  - After event2 → event3 (forced).
  - After event3 → choose event2.
  - Repeat 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 ... forever.
  This run contains event1 but never contains event4. Therefore C1 (event4) does not hold in that run, so the implication C2 (event1 → event4) is not guaranteed.
- Conclusion: C2 is False (not valid under the given rules).

Short answer: You cannot determine a single truth value for C2 from the given rules alone. Both C2 and its negation (C1) are possible in different allowed evolutions, so C2 is neither forced true nor forced false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules (read as: ""after X, one of Y must happen"")
- After event2 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1 → event3 must happen.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.

(Implicit: whenever a rule says ""must"", one of the listed next events must be chosen; choices may be nondeterministic when there are several options.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e., at some point in the run/event sequence, either event4 or event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., neither event4 nor event2 ever occurs (so only event1 and event3 may occur).

4) How the conditions relate / reasoning
- From the initial event1 and the rule event1 → event3, event3 must occur next.
- From event3, the rule requires one of {event1, event2, event4}.
  - If the choice is event1, then event1 → event3 again, and we can cycle event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 ... forever. In that execution no event2 or event4 ever occurs, so C1 is false and C2 is true in that run.
  - If instead at some point the choice from event3 is event2 or event4, then C1 is true (and so C2 is false) in that run. For example: event1 → event3 → event2 (then by rule event2 → event3, etc.).

Conclusion
- Because the choices after event3 (and after event4) are nondeterministic, there exist valid runs where neither event2 nor event4 ever occurs (making C2 true) and other valid runs where event2 or event4 does occur (making C2 false). Therefore, C2 is not universally true nor universally false — its truth is undetermined by the given rules (both possibilities are consistent).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C2 (""neither event2 nor event4 ever occurs"") is not guaranteed by the rules — there exist allowed runs where event3 leads to event2 or event4, making C1 true and C2 false. Because C2 is not true in all possible executions, it is not entailed. (There do exist runs where C2 holds, so it is only contingent, not universally true.)"

- From the initial condition we know event4 does happen (it happened initially), so C1 is false.
- C2 is the statement (¬event4) ∨ event4. Since event4 does happen, the right disjunct is true, so C2 evaluates to true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (nondeterministic choices)
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen. (event1 → (event2 or event4))
- After event2: event4 must happen. (event2 → event4)
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen. (event4 → (event1 or event3))
- After event3: no other events can happen. (event3 → stop)
(Repeated statements in the context are redundant; they state the same rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as a universal implication: whenever event4 occurs, it is followed by event1 (i.e., event4 → event1, ruling out the event4→event3 option).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Interpreted as: assuming C1 is true in the system, does event2 necessarily happen (at least once / eventually)?

Step 4 — how they relate; truth values
- Is C1 true (entailed by the rules)? No. The rules allow event4 to be followed by event3, so C1 (that event4 always leads to event1) is not guaranteed. Counterexample trace: initial event4 → event3, and then stop; event1 never occurs. So C1 is not entailed by the given rules.
- Is C2 true (i.e., assuming C1, does event2 necessarily happen)? No. Even if you assume C1 (force event4 → event1), event1 can nondeterministically lead back to event4 instead of event2. That yields a possible infinite loop event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 … in which event2 never occurs. So C2 is not guaranteed either.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (after X, one of the listed events must happen)
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event3: event4 (i.e. {event4}).

Step 3 — what the conditions C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event3 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalent to ""event3 does not happen"".

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial event1 the system nondeterministically chooses one of {event2, event3, event4} next. That means:
  - There are executions where event3 happens immediately (e.g. 1 → 3 → 4 → …), so C1 can be true.
  - There are also executions that avoid event3 indefinitely (e.g. alternate 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → …), so C1 can be false and therefore C2 can be true.
- Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed) by the rules, but it is possible. In logical terms:
  - C2 is satisfiable (there exists a valid run where C2 is true).
  - C2 is not valid/necessary (it is not true in all runs).

So, if you must answer “C2 is True or False?”: C2 can be true in some executions and false in others — it is possible but not guaranteed.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (call this State0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event3 must occur next.
- After event3 occurs, event4 must occur next.
- After event4 occurs, no other events can occur (terminal).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can occur (terminal). (event1 does not occur initially, so this is irrelevant here.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" Interpreted as: at the current state, the immediately following state has event4.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted as: at some reachable future state (possibly not the current one), C1 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Timeline from the initial state (State0):
  - State0: event2.
  - State1 (next): event3 (by rule).
  - State2 (next): event4 (by rule).
  - After State2 no further events.
- Evaluate C1:
  - At State0: next state is State1, which has event3, not event4 → C1 is false at State0.
  - At State1: next state is State2, which has event4 → C1 is true at State1.
- Since State1 is reachable from the initial state, there exists a future state where C1 holds. Therefore ""eventually C1"" is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the trace starts with event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
Interpreting each rule as “after eventX, the next event must be one of …”:
- After event3: next is event1 or event4.
- After event1: next is event2 or event4.
- After event4: next is event2 or event3.
- After event2: next is event1 or event4.
(Notes: the context repeated the rules for event4 and event2 twice, but they are the same constraints.)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This is just a redundant way of saying “Event2 happens” (i.e., event2 occurs at some point).
- C2: “If event3 happens, then C1 holds.” That is, whenever event3 occurs, event2 will (eventually) occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and whether C2 is true
- From the transition graph, starting at the initial event4 you can choose the allowed next events. In particular, from event4 you may go to event3, and from event3 you may go back to event4. So there is a possible infinite trace:
  4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ...
  In that trace event3 occurs (repeatedly) but event2 never occurs.
- Because there is at least one allowed execution where event3 occurs but event2 never occurs, the implication “if event3 happens then event2 happens” is not guaranteed by the rules.

Conclusion
- C2 is False (there is a valid counterexample trace 4→3→4→3→… where event3 happens but event2 never happens).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C1 just says ""event2 occurs."" From the rules starting at event4 you can follow 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → …, so event3 happens while event2 never occurs. That is a valid trace that violates ""if event3 happens then event2 happens,"" so C2 is not guaranteed."

Step-by-step.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (so we start at event4).

2) Transition rules (from each event, the next event must be one of the listed):
- After event2 → either event1 or event4.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event4 → either event1, event2, or event3.
- After event3 → either event2 or event4.
(The “after event3 …” line is repeated in the statement; it does not change anything.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean:
- C1: “Event4 happens and event1 happens.” Given the initial condition, “event4 happens” is true; C1 further requires that event1 occurs at some point.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., either event4 did not happen or event1 does not happen. Since event4 is given as happening, C2 is equivalent here to “event1 does not happen” (event1 never occurs).

4) How the conditions relate; is C2 True or False?
- From event4 the rules allow event1 next, so there exist executions where event1 does occur. Example (shows C1 true, so C2 false in this run):
  - e4 → e1 (allowed).
- But the rules also allow executions that never include event1. For example, you can cycle without event1:
  - e4 → e3 → e2 → e4 → e3 → e2 → e4 → ... (each step is allowed: e4→e3, e3→e2, e2→e4). In such an execution event1 never happens, so C1 is false and C2 true in that run.

Conclusion:
- The information does not force a single truth value. C2 is not entailed (not necessarily true) because there are valid executions where C1 holds (making C2 false). C2 is also not refuted (not necessarily false) because there are valid executions where event1 never happens (making C2 true).
- So the correct answer: C2 is neither universally True nor universally False given the rules — it is possible (satisfiable) and also possible to be false. In other words, its truth is indeterminate from the given information (depends on nondeterministic choices).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (initially).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event4 must happen. (event3 → event4)
- After event4, event1 must happen. (event4 → event1)
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. (event1 → {event2 or event4})
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → event1)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event2 happens."" (both occur at some point)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. it is not the case that both event4 and event2 happen.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the rules and the initial event3 we get this forced prefix: event3 → event4 → event1. So event4 definitely happens (at least once) and event1 definitely happens (at least once).
- At event1 there is a nondeterministic choice: either go to event2 (which will lead back to event1), or go to event4 (which leads back to event1). Thus:
  - There exist executions where event2 never happens (always choose event4 after event1). Example run: event3, event4, event1, event4, event1, ...
    - In such a run C1 is false, so C2 is true.
  - There also exist executions where event2 does happen (choose event2 at some occurrence of event1). Example run: event3, event4, event1, event2, event1, ...
    - In such a run C1 is true, so C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is neither universally true nor universally false given the rules. It is contingent: true in some possible executions and false in others. (Formally: C1 is satisfiable but not entailed; C2 is also satisfiable but not entailed.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens first.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen next.
- After event1: no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3: one of {event1, event4} must happen next.
- After event4: one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen next.

Step 3 — meaning of the subconditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" simplifies to ""Event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" therefore means ""Event3 does not happen.""

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C2
- From the rules, event3 may happen (e.g., choose event2 → event3). But it is not forced to happen because you can choose event2 → event1 and stop, in which case event3 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 happens"") is not guaranteed, and its negation C2 (""event3 does not happen"") is also not guaranteed.
- Concretely:
  - A sequence where C2 is true: [event2, event1] (event3 never occurs).
  - A sequence where C2 is false: [event2, event3, event1] (event3 occurs).

Conclusion
- C2 is undetermined by the given information: it can be true in some allowed sequences and false in others. It is neither logically entailed nor logically refuted by the premises.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start in state event3).

2) Transition rules (what may happen immediately after each event)
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.

(One of the ""after event4"" lines was repeated; both say the same thing.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event4 eventually happens.” (Usually this is read as “event4 will occur at some future step.”)
- C2: “C1 holds and event3 happens.” That is, event4 eventually happens AND event3 happens. Since event3 already happened initially, the “event3 happens” part is already satisfied by the initial condition.

4) How the conditions relate
- Because event3 is true initially, C2 reduces to “event4 eventually happens” (the same as C1) in this scenario.
- Is event4 forced to occur on every possible execution (i.e., inevitability)? No: from the initial event3 we may repeatedly choose transitions that avoid event4:
  - Example infinite trace that avoids event4: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ...  
    (3→1 is allowed; 1→3 is allowed. Repeating these choices never reaches 4.)
- Because such a trace exists, event4 is not guaranteed to eventually happen on all executions. Therefore C1 is not necessarily true under the usual universal reading of “eventually” (i.e., “will happen on every possible run”).

Conclusion
- Under the standard universal interpretation (must/eventually on all runs): C1 is false, hence C2 is false.
- (If one instead reads “eventually” existentially — “there exists a run where event4 happens” — then C1 is true (e.g. 3→4) and C2 would be true. But with the usual intent here, C2 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===

- After event4 → event2 or event3 must happen.

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible run/execution, event3 never occurs).

- From the initial event4, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
  - If it is event3, then event3 happens (so C1 is false on that run).
  - If it is event2, then by the rule after event2, event3 must happen next (so event3 still happens).
- In every possible choice from the initial state, event3 occurs (either immediately or after event2). Therefore event3 always occurs in every run.

Thus C1 is false, and C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially: event2 happened (so the current state is one where event2 occurred).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4: event1 must happen next.
(You listed the rules twice for event3 and event4; they are the same rules repeated.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event4 happens."" Interpreting this in the usual state-by-state model, C1 asserts that both event3 and event4 hold (i.e., occur) in the same state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the immediate successor state of the current (initial) state, both event3 and event4 occur in that next state.

(If instead C1 were intended to mean “event3 happens at some time and event4 happens at some (possibly different) time,” that is a different, weaker meaning — but C2 still says that both must be true in the very next state.)

4) Evaluation / conclusion
- From the initial state (event2), the allowed next events are event1 or event3 (by the rule for event2).
- In either case:
  - If next = event1, then event3 and event4 are not both true in that next state.
  - If next = event3, event4 is not also true in that same next state (only one event occurs in a state under these rules).
- Therefore it is impossible for both event3 and event4 to hold simultaneously in the immediate next state. So C2 is False.

(If you meant ""C1"" as “event3 occurs at some time and event4 occurs at some (future) time,” then both can happen along some path — e.g., event2 → event3 → event4 — but even then C2, which requires both to hold in the immediate next state, is still False.)

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (this is the starting point).

2) Transition rules (what must follow each event)
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: event1 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
(One of the ""after event2"" lines is duplicated; it doesn't change anything.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (Given the context, this says at least one of event1 or event2 will occur after the initial event3.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" — i.e., (event1 or event2 occurs) AND event1 occurs.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- From the rule for event3, after the initial event3 either event1 or event2 must occur, so C1 holds.
- Consider the two possibilities after event3:
  - If event1 happens next, then event1 has happened (so C2 holds).
  - If event2 happens next, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen immediately after, so event1 still occurs (so C2 holds).
- In every possible evolution from the initial event3, event1 occurs (either immediately or after event2). Therefore both parts of C2 are satisfied in all cases.

Conclusion: C2 is necessarily True. (Event4 is irrelevant here because it never occurs.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From event3, either event1 or event2 must occur (so C1 holds). If event1 occurs then C2 holds immediately. If event2 occurs then the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur next, so C2 holds as well. In every possible evolution event1 happens, so C2 is necessarily true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.

These rules form a forced cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1. “After X, Y must happen” is read as: whenever X occurs, Y will (inevitably) occur sometime afterward.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event4 happens.” (Both events occur at some points in time.)
- C2: “C1 holds and event3 happens.” In other words, event2 and event4 happen, and event3 happens as well.

(There is no C3 given in the problem.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event2 and the rules:
  - event2 (given) ⇒ event3 must happen.
  - event3 ⇒ event4 must happen.
  - event4 ⇒ event1 must happen.
  - event1 ⇒ event2 must happen (cycle continues).
- Therefore event3 and event4 will indeed happen (following the initial event2). So C1 (event2 and event4 happen) is true.
- Since event3 also happens, C2 (C1 and event3) is also true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
(Notes: some rules were duplicated in the statement; I treated duplicates as the same constraints.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (i.e., at some future point event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" So C2 is true if either event3 eventually occurs, or event1 occurs (or both).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion about C2
- From the initial event4 and the rules: because ""after event4, event1 must happen"", event1 will occur immediately after the initial event4. Then ""after event1, event4 must happen"" so a 4↔1 cycle follows (4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → ...). Thus event1 does indeed happen (it is forced by the initial event4).
- C1 (event3 eventually happens) is not guaranteed by any rule: no rule forces event3 to occur, so C1 is not entailed (it may be false or simply unknown/optional).
- But C2 = (C1 OR event1). Since event1 is guaranteed to happen, C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Therefore C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event4 has occurred initially and the rules force event1 after event4, so event1 will happen; thus (event3 eventually happens) OR (event1 happens) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is the current state).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: next must be event2 or event3 or event4.
- After event2: next must be event1 or event3.
- After event3: next must be event1 or event4.
- After event4: next must be event2 or event3.
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the statement but they are the same constraints above.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state.” (i.e., the immediate successor state is event3.)
- C2: “C1 holds or event3 happens.” Interpreting “event3 happens” here as meaning “event3 happens in the next state” (the natural reading in this context), C2 is logically the same as “event3 happens in the next state” (so C2 is equivalent to C1).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial event1, the transition rule allows next = {event2, event3, event4}. So event3 is possible but not forced.
- Therefore C1 is possible (true in some executions) and possible false (false in others).
- Since C2 is equivalent to C1 under the usual reading, C2 is likewise not guaranteed: it can be true or false depending on which allowed transition is taken.

Concise conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true. It is satisfiable (there are executions where C2 is true) but not valid (there are executions where C2 is false).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: from initial event1 the next state may be event2 (allowed), so event3 does not happen next; hence C1 is false and C2 (equivalent to ""next is event3"") is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially (at the current state) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event3 → event1 must happen (next).
- After event1 → next is either event3 or event4.
- After event4 → next is either event1 or event3.
- After event2 → next is either event1 or event3.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — i.e. immediately after the initial state.
- C2: “Event4 happens and C1 holds” — both event4 occurs (somewhere as stated) and C1 is true (event2 happens in the next state). Practically this requires that the next state is event2 and that event4 also occurs (at whatever time the statement intends), but C1 is a strict requirement about the immediate next state.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the rule “after event2 → either event1 or event3,” the immediate next event after the initial event2 must be event1 or event3. Therefore event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- Because C1 is false, the conjunction in C2 (""event4 happens and C1 holds"") cannot be true, regardless of whether event4 might occur later in a sequence (for example: event2 → event3 → event1 → event4 is allowed). Thus C2 is false.

Conclusion: C1 = False, so C2 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: initially event2 happened, and the rule ""after event2 → either event1 or event3"" forces the next state to be event1 or event3, so C1 (""event2 in the next state"") is false. Since C2 is ""event4 happens and C1 holds"", the conjunction cannot be true if C1 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (read as implications)
- If event3 happens then event4 must happen. (3 → 4)
- If event4 happens then one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen. (4 → (1 ∨ 2 ∨ 3))
- If event1 happens then event2 must happen. (1 → 2)
- If event2 happens then one of event3 or event4 must happen. (2 → (3 ∨ 4))
(The last rule is repeated but is the same as the previous.)

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: event4 happens and event1 happens (4 ∧ 1).
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds (2 ∨ (4 ∧ 1)).

Step 4 — how they relate; determine C2
- From the initial condition and the rule 1 → 2, event2 must happen (because event1 happened initially).
- Therefore event2 is true.
- Since C2 is ""event2 or C1"", and event2 is true, C2 is true (a disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true).
- Note: C1 is not guaranteed — event4 is not forced by the rules in every possible evolution (2 can lead to 3 or to 4), so C1 may or may not hold. But C2 is true regardless because event2 definitely holds.

Final answer: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has occurred (no other events have occurred initially).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event4, event2 must happen. (4 → eventually 2)
- After event2, event4 must happen. (2 → eventually 4)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (1 is terminal)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (3 → eventually 1)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens"" (i.e., F(event4)).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — formally F(C1), i.e. F(F(event4)). (Note: in standard temporal logic F(F(p)) is equivalent to F(p), so C2 is logically the same as C1.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- To get event4 at any time you need event2 first (because 4 → eventually 2 and 2 → eventually 4, so 2 and 4 are mutually dependent). But neither event2 nor event4 is produced by any rule independently; they can only occur if the other has already occurred. Thus there is no way to start the 2↔4 cycle from the initial condition.
- Meanwhile event3 (which did occur initially) forces event1 to occur. Once event1 occurs, no further events can happen (terminal).
- Therefore event4 can never occur in any continuation from the initial state. So C1 is false, and therefore C2 (equivalent to C1) is also false.

(If you interpreted ""must happen"" as allowing arbitrary other events before the required one, the same conclusion holds because nothing in the rules can generate the first occurrence of event2 or event4.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event3 holds initially, which forces event1 to occur; event1 is terminal (no further events). That prevents any occurrence of event2 or event4, so C1 (F[event4]) is false and therefore C2 (F[F[event4]]) is also false."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (the run starts with event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event4 must happen (event1 → eventually event4).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (event4 → next is event2 or event3).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (event3 → next is event2 or event4).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (Both events occur somewhere in the run.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (At some point in the execution, the condition C1 is satisfied.)

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- The run starts with event2. Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the system stops immediately after that initial event2; no further events (including event1) can occur.
- Since event1 cannot occur at any later time and could not have occurred before the initial event2 (the run begins with event2), event1 never happens.
- Therefore C1 (which requires event1 to happen) cannot become true, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: The run starts with event2 and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" so no event1 can occur before or after that initial event2. Therefore C1 (both event2 and event1 occur) cannot become true, so C2 is false."

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially: event2 has happened (we start in a state immediately after event2).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event4, event2 must happen (so event4 → event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 has no outgoing transitions).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 has no outgoing transitions).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so event3 → {event1, event2}).

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” That asserts that, from whatever state we consider, the immediate next state witnesses event4.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” That asserts that at some (possibly future) state, C1 is true — i.e., there is some state whose immediate successor has event4.

4) How the conditions relate and final reasoning
- We start in a state after event2.
- The rule “after event2, no other events can happen” means there are no transitions out of the current state. No future state can be reached where event4 occurs in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false in the current state (there is no next state where event4 happens), and there is no future state that could make C1 true. Hence C2 (“eventually C1”) is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step answer.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (event3 → eventually event1)
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen. (event1 → eventually (event3 or event4))
- After event4, event2 must happen. (event4 → eventually event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → eventually event3)

(“After X must happen” I read as: whenever X occurs, the other event is guaranteed to occur later.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event4 → event1 (event1 will occur sometime after event4).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" That is the conjunction: (event4 → event1) AND (event2 happens somewhere).

4) How the conditions relate; validity of C1 and C2
- From the rules we can chain implications:
  event4 → event2 (given)
  event2 → event3 (given)
  event3 → event1 (given)
  therefore event4 → event1 (by transitivity). So C1 is entailed by the rules — C1 is true (it must hold).

- C2 requires both C1 and that event2 happens. We have C1 true, but the rules do NOT force event2 to occur in every possible run:
  - From the initial event1, the rule says either event3 or event4 must happen. It is permissible (consistent with the rules) that event3 happens repeatedly and event4 never occurs. In that trace: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... event2 never occurs. Thus event2 is not guaranteed.
  - Therefore C2 is not necessarily true (not entailed). C2 can be true in some executions (e.g., if at some point event4 happens then event2 will follow), but it is not guaranteed in all executions.

Final answers:
- C1: True (entailed).
- C2: Not necessarily true (false as a necessary/entailed statement). It is possible (satisfiable) but not guaranteed.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Step 1 — Given: event1 has happened initially.

Step 2 — Rules:
- event3 → event1
- event1 → (event3 or event4)
- event4 → event2
- event2 → event3

Step 3 — C1: event4 → event1
- Chain: event4 → event2 → event3 → event1, so C1 is entailed (true).

Step 4 — C2: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens somewhere)
- C1 holds, but event2 is not forced by the rules. Counterexample trace consistent with the rules: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... (always choose event3 after event1), so event2 never occurs in that trace.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at time 0 event3 happens.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event2 → event3 (deterministic).
- After event3 → event1 (deterministic).
- After event1 → either event3 or event4 (non‑deterministic choice).
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 (non‑deterministic choice).

Step 3 — meanings of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — formally: at every time step from the start, the occurring event is event3 (temporal logic: G(event3)).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — formally: there exists a time after which C1 is true forever (temporal logic: F G(event3)), i.e. eventually from some point onward event3 happens at every step.

Step 4 — how they relate and which is true
- C1 is false: already from the rules, after any occurrence of event3 the next event must be event1, so there is at least one step (immediately after time 0) where the event is not event3. Thus event3 does not hold at every time.
- C2 is also false: to satisfy ""eventually always event3"" we would need a suffix of the execution where every step is event3. That is impossible because whenever event3 occurs the next step is forced to be event1. So no infinite suffix can consist only of event3. Therefore you cannot reach a point after which every event is event3.

Counterexample traces illustrating impossibility:
- Deterministic short trace: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... (event3 never occurs in two consecutive steps).
- Any other choices (via 1→4 or 4→2) still eventually return to 3 but never allow an infinite run of only event3.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen. (3 → 2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (2 → 3)
  => Together these force recurring occurrences of event2 and event3.
- After event1, event4 must happen. (1 → 4)
- After event4, event1 must happen. (4 → 1)
  => These two force recurring occurrences of event1 and event4, if either ever occurs, but nothing in the context forces them to start.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens or event4 happens.”
  Given the rules and the initial event2, event2 → event3, so event3 will happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” This requires both (event3 or event4) and event1 to occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and final conclusion
- From the context we can deduce event3 happens (so C1 is true).
- There is no rule or initial fact that forces event1 to occur, nor any link from the {2,3} cycle to the {1,4} cycle. So event1 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 (C1 and event1) is not guaranteed; C2 is false (not entailed) by the given information. 

(If an external assumption made event1 happen, C2 could become true, but based only on the provided context, C2 is false.)

Short answer: C1 is false (event4 does not necessarily happen), so C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start.

2) Transition rules (in plain language)
- After event3 occurs, event1 must (eventually) occur.
- After event1 occurs, either event2 or event3 must (eventually) occur.
- After event2 occurs, either event3 or event4 must (eventually) occur.
- After event4 occurs, event3 must (eventually) occur.

(“Must” here means: whenever the antecedent event happens, the consequent(s) must occur at some later point.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: in the execution under consideration, event4 occurs at some point (or: event4 is guaranteed to occur in every possible execution depending on whether you mean a universal claim).
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds."" This is just the conjunction of event4 happening and C1; since C1 already states that event4 eventually happens, C2 is equivalent to “event4 happens” (or more precisely, “event4 happens and it is true that event4 eventually happens”).

4) How the conditions relate / detailed reasoning
- From the initial event1 we must follow the rule: after event1 either event2 or event3 happens.
- Consider this choice sequence that avoids event4 forever:
  event1 (initial) → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... .
  This respects the rules: after each event1 we pick event3; after each event3 the rule requires event1, which we do. No rule forces us to ever pick event2 or event4, so event4 can be avoided indefinitely.
- Because there exists a valid execution in which event4 never occurs, the statement “event4 eventually happens” (C1) is not guaranteed and hence is false as a universal/necessary claim.
- Since C2 includes C1 as a conjunct, C2 is also false (not necessarily true). (In some particular executions event4 does occur — e.g. event1 → event2 → event4 → event3 → … — but C1 and C2 are not necessarily true across all allowed executions.)

Conclusion:
- C1: False (not guaranteed).
- C2: False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (""event4 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed because the sequence event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... satisfies all rules and never reaches event4; thus C2 (which requires C1) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen (next ∈ {3,4}).
- After event3: either event1, event2, or event4 must happen (next ∈ {1,2,4}).
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen (next ∈ {1,2}). (This rule appears twice but is the same.)
- After event1: event2 must happen (next = 2). (Also repeated.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens and event4 happens.” That means both events occur at some points in the execution (we already have event4 initially; C1 requires that event2 also occurs sometime).
- C2: “C1 holds and event3 happens.” So C2 requires event4 and event2 to occur and also event3 to occur at some point.

Step 4 — how the rules connect and final answer
- From the initial event4, the rule for event4 forces the next event to be either event1 or event2.
  - If 4 → 2 directly, event2 happens.
  - If 4 → 1, then after 1 we must have 2 (because 1 → 2). So either way, event2 will occur after the initial event4.
- Therefore C1 (event4 and event2 both happen) is guaranteed (True).
- Is event3 guaranteed? After event2, the next event must be either 3 or 4. That is a choice; nothing forces the choice to be 3. One can always pick 4 instead, and then continue a loop (4→1→2→4→2→4...) that never includes 3. So event3 is possible but not inevitable.
- Hence C2 (requires event3 in addition to C1) is not guaranteed. It is satisfiable (there are runs where it holds, e.g. 4→2→3), but there are also valid runs where it never happens (e.g. 4→2→4→2→4→...).

Conclusion
- C1: True (necessarily holds).
- C2: Not necessarily true — possible but not guaranteed. If you mean “Does C2 follow from the rules?” the answer is No (C2 is not entailed). If you mean “Can C2 be true in some execution?” the answer is Yes (it’s possible).

Answer: C2 is not guaranteed — it can be true in some executions and false in others.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (and the ""After event3, no other events can happen"" line is repeated but is just redundant).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event4 must happen. (event1 → event4)
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen. (event4 → {event2, event3})
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (event2 → {event1, event3})
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is logically just ""Event1 happens"" (a tautological repetition).
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" — i.e., both event3 and event1 occur at some point.

4) How the conditions relate / truth of C2
- From the initial event4, one allowed next step is event3, yielding the trace: event4 → event3 and then stop. In that trace event1 never occurs, so C1 is false and therefore C2 is false. So C2 is not necessarily true.
- There are other allowed traces where event1 does occur, e.g. event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → ... → event2 → event3. In such a trace both event1 and event3 occur, so C2 is true in that run.

Conclusion: C2 is not entailed by the premises. It is possible (true in some traces) but not guaranteed (false in other traces).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event4 we can have the trace event4 → event3, where event1 never occurs; thus C1 fails and so C2 (event3 and event1) is not guaranteed."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event4: one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event4} must happen.
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3: one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.

(These determine which next events are allowed from each current event.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting “always” as a global property: in every state (i.e., at every step from now on) event3 occurs — equivalently, no execution can avoid event3.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: after one allowed transition from the initial state, from that next state onward C1 is true (i.e., from that next state event3 would then be guaranteed forever).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 is false: give a concrete counterexample trace that follows the rules but never contains event3. From the initial event4 take event1 (allowed). From event1 go back to event4 (allowed). Repeat: 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → ... This infinite trace never contains event3, so event3 is not guaranteed to always happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state. Consider the possible next states after the initial event4:
  - If next = event1, we can then loop 1↔4 forever (as above), so C1 fails.
  - If next = event2, from event2 you can choose event1 and then loop 1↔4, so C1 fails.
  - If next = event3, from event3 you can choose event1 next and then loop 1↔4, so C1 still fails.
  Thus in every possible next state there is an allowed continuation that avoids event3 forever, so C1 does not hold at that next state.
- Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event4 the next state can be event1, event2, or event3. In each case there is an allowed continuation that never contains event3 (e.g. take event1 → event4 → event1 → …). Thus C1 (""event3 always happens"") does not hold in any of those next states, so C2 is False."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, exactly one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen (i.e. one of those occurs next).
- After event2, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, no further events can happen (event4 is terminal).

So the possible complete traces are exactly:
- event1 → event2
- event1 → event3
- event1 → event4

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event4 always happens.” Interpreted as: in every possible trace/possibility, event4 occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” That means both (a) event4 always happens, and (b) event2 happens (in the actual/considered execution).

4) How the conditions relate and truth values
- C1 is false: it is not true that event4 always happens, because there exist possible traces (e.g. event1 → event2 or event1 → event3) where event4 does not occur. A single counterexample like event1 → event2 shows C1 fails.
- C2 therefore is false. It requires C1 to be true and also event2 to happen. Since C1 is false, C2 cannot hold. (Also note a logical inconsistency: if event4 truly happened in every trace, there would be no trace in which event2 happens, so C1 and “event2 happens” cannot both be true.)

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
(Notes: the last two rules are repeated in the text; they do not add new information.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction and is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Because event2 is given to have happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" So C2 requires (a) event2 happened (C1) and (b) event3 happened.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- We have event2 initially, so C1 is true.
- There is no rule that ever causes event3 to occur, and the given facts do not state that event3 happens. The rule involving event3 only constrains what must follow if event3 happens; it does not assert that event3 actually occurs.
- Therefore event3 is not known (not entailed) to happen, so the conjunction C1 ∧ event3 is not satisfied.

Conclusion: C1 is true; C2 is false (given the provided facts and rules).

False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the current state (call it s0) event3 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event4 → event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1 → the next state must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2 → the next state must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event3 → event1 must happen in the next state.
(“After event3, event1 must happen” is given twice but is the same constraint.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “event3 happens or event2 happens” — i.e., in a given state, either event3 or event2 holds.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the immediate successor state of the current state, event3 or event2 holds.

4) Relation and evaluation
- We start in s0 where event3 holds, so C1 is true in s0.
- But because after event3 the next state must be event1, the immediate successor state s1 has event1 (no choice).
- In s1 event1 holds, which is neither event3 nor event2, so C1 does not hold in s1.
- Therefore C2 (“C1 holds in the next state”) is false.

Short answer: C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially event1 has occurred.

2) Transition rules (what can follow each event)
- After event1: one of event2, event3, or event4 must occur next.
- After event2: one of event1 or event4 must occur next.
- After event3: one of event1 or event2 must occur next.
- After event4: no further events can occur (event4 is terminal/absorbing).

(We assume non-deterministic choices at each step; sequences may be finite if event4 occurs or infinite otherwise.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" Interpreting this as: in every possible execution starting from the initial state, event4 eventually occurs (i.e., event4 is inevitable). (If someone read C1 as “every step is event4,” that is impossible here; the natural reading is inevitability.)
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" That is, either event3 occurs at some point in the execution, or event4 is inevitable in every execution.

4) How the conditions relate (and the counterexample)
- C1 is false: there is at least one possible execution that never reaches event4. For example:
  - Start: event1
  - Then choose event2
  - Then choose event1
  - Then choose event2
  - Repeat forever: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ...
  This infinite run respects the rules (after 1 choose 2, after 2 choose 1, etc.) and never reaches event4, so event4 is not inevitable.
- Because C1 is false, C2 reduces to ""event3 happens."" But the same infinite run above never contains event3, so in that run neither event3 happens nor does C1 hold. Therefore C2 is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is false (counterexample: the infinite alternation 1,2,1,2,... avoids both event3 and event4). If you impose additional fairness/termination assumptions (for example, that choices cannot avoid some option forever), the answer could change, but with the given rules and ordinary nondeterministic executions, C2 does not hold.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: the infinite run 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... follows the rules, never reaches event4 (so C1 is false) and never contains event3, so ""event3 happens or C1 holds"" (C2) is false."

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (This asserts that event1 never happens.)
- C2: ""Event4 happens or C1 holds."" So C2 is true exactly when either event4 occurs (at some point) or event1 never occurs.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- C1 is false, because the initial condition says event1 did happen.
- Therefore C2 simplifies to ""event4 happens.""
- Is event4 forced by the rules? No — there is a valid run that avoids event4 forever, for example:
  1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → ... 
  This loop satisfies all rules (after each 1 choose 3, after 3 go to 2, after 2 choose 1) and never includes event4.
- So event4 does not necessarily happen. Hence C2 is not guaranteed (it can be true in some runs, but it is not entailed by the rules).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial event: event3 happens first.

2) Transition rules (allowed next events)
- After event3: either event1 or event2.
- After event1: either event2 or event4.
- After event2: either event1 or event4.
- After event4: either event1 or event3.
(Several lines in the problem repeat the same rules; the above summarizes them.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e. at some future point event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — that is, at some future point it becomes true that event2 will eventually occur. (In temporal logic notation, C1 = F(event2) and C2 = F(F(event2)). Note F(F(p)) is equivalent to F(p), but that equivalence doesn't affect the following argument.)

4) How they relate / decision
- We can exhibit a valid infinite trace that never contains event2, so C1 is not guaranteed and C2 is false. Example trace starting from the initial event3:
  event3 -> event1 -> event4 -> event3 -> event1 -> event4 -> event3 -> ...
  Each step follows an allowed transition (3→1, 1→4, 4→3). This infinite cycle never includes event2, so at no point does ""event2 eventually happens"" become true. Therefore C1 does not hold on that trace, and there is no future point where C1 becomes true; hence C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event4 must occur next.
- After event2 occurs, event4 must occur next.
- After event3 occurs, either event1 or event2 must occur next.
- After event4 occurs, either event1, event2, or event3 must occur next.
(Note: the last rule is repeated in the problem but gives the same constraint twice.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to just ""Event2 happens."" (the disjunction repeats the same proposition.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" in the usual temporal sense (globally), C2 means: at every time point (for the entire execution/trace) C1 is true — i.e., event2 holds at all times.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true?
- The rules allow nondeterministic choices; they do not force event2 to occur at every step. For example, a valid infinite trace that respects all rules is:
  time0: event1
  time1: event4   (required after event1)
  time2: event1   (one of the options after event4)
  time3: event4   (required after event1)
  time4: event1
  ...
  This repeats (event1 → event4 → event1 → ...). In this trace event2 never occurs, so C1 (""event2 happens"") is not true at any time, and certainly C1 is not true at every time point. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C1 is ""event2"" and C2 asserts that event2 holds at every time. A valid trace (event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ...) respects all rules and never contains event2, so C1 does not hold always. Hence C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we are at a state right after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1: the next event must be either event3 or event4.
- After event3: the next event must be event2.
- After event4: the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event2: the next event must be either event1 or event4.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” Interpreting this as a proposition about a given state (i.e., in that state event3 does not occur).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the state immediately following the current one, event3 does not happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and the verdict
- From the initial state (just after event1), the rules force the next event to be either event3 or event4.
- If the next event is event3, then C1 is false in that next state (because event3 did happen).
- If the next event is event4, then C1 is true in that next state (because event3 did not happen there).

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed. It is satisfiable (true on some runs, e.g. event1 → event4) but not valid (false on other runs, e.g. event1 → event3). So if you must answer True or False as a necessity/entailment: C2 is False (not necessarily true).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the system starts at event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3: next must be event1 or event2. (3 -> {1,2})
- After event1: next must be event3 or event4. (1 -> {3,4})
- After event2: next must be event1 or event3. (2 -> {1,3})
- After event4: next must be event2 or event3. (4 -> {2,3})

These are nondeterministic choices — from a given event, either of the listed successors may occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event4 happens.” (Given the initial condition, event2 already has happened; C1 requires that event4 also occurs at some point.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreting “always” in the usual sense for nondeterministic systems: C2 asserts that in every possible future (every possible allowed sequence of events starting from the initial event2) C1 is true — i.e., in every run both event2 and event4 occur (event2 already does, so it requires that event4 occurs in every run).

Step 4 — how they relate; does C2 hold?
- C1 can be true in some runs. Example run: 2 -> 1 -> 4. This run contains both event2 (initial) and event4, so C1 holds on that run.
- But C1 does not hold in all runs. Counterexample run avoiding event4 entirely: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... . All transitions used are allowed (2->3, 3->1, 1->3, etc.), and this run never visits event4. Thus there exists a valid run where event4 never happens, so C1 is false on that run.

Conclusion
- Because there is at least one valid execution that never reaches event4, C1 is not guaranteed in all runs. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (so the system starts after event3).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""must happen"" as a required next event and ""either ... or ..."" as a required choice)
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event3 must happen (2 → 3).
- After event3: event4 must happen (3 → 4).
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen (4 → {2, 3}).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — there exists some future point in any execution at which event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event4 happens"" — both (a) event1 eventually happens, and (b) event4 happens at some point.

4) How the conditions relate / evaluation
- From the rules and the initial event3 we get: 3 → 4, and from 4 we must go to 2 or 3. If we go to 2 it forces 3 next, and 3 forces 4, etc. So all reachable events from the initial state are in the set {2,3,4}, and the system cycles among these (3→4→(2 or 3)→3→4→...).
- There is no rule that leads to event1, and event1 is not the initial event, so event1 is unreachable in all executions. Therefore C1 is false.
- Event4 does occur (immediately after the initial event3), so the second part of C2 is true, but because C2 is a conjunction and C1 is false, C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the run starts with event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen (i.e. sometime after an occurrence of event1, event3 will occur).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens"" — there is an execution in which both event2 and event3 occur (not necessarily in any particular order).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — in every possible execution consistent with the rules, both event2 and event3 occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and final verdict
- event3 will occur in every execution because the run starts with event1 and “after event1, event3 must happen.” Once event3 occurs, the run terminates (no further events).
- event2 is not forced to occur by any rule. It can occur in some executions (for example: event1 → event2 → event1 → event3 is allowed: after the first event1 you may take event2, then event2→event1, then event1→event3 which ends), so C1 is satisfiable in some runs.
- However, there are valid runs where event2 never occurs: the simplest is event1 → event3 immediately, and then stop. That run contains event3 but not event2, so C1 is false in that run.

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False (counterexample: the run event1 → event3).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: the run event1 → event3 is valid (event3 must occur after event1 and then terminates) and contains no event2, so C1 does not hold in that run. Hence C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen. (This was stated twice; it’s the same rule.)
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (A statement about the immediate successor state.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreted as: in every possible situation (every reachable state or at every step), the next state will be event1.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial event2, the rules allow either event1 or event3 next. So C1 is not guaranteed: one allowed next state is event3, which makes C1 false in that choice.
- Because there exists a permitted next state (event3) where C1 is false, C1 does not always hold. Therefore C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.
- (Counterexample run: event2 -> event3. In that transition C1 is false, so C2 fails.)

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed — False (but satisfiable on some runs).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we start at a state labeled event1).

2) Transition rules
- From event1: next must be event2 or event4 (1 -> {2,4}).
- From event2: next must be event1 or event3 or event4 (2 -> {1,3,4}).
- From event4: next must be event3 (4 -> 3).
- From event3: no further events (3 is terminal).
(“After event4, event3 must happen” appears twice but is the same constraint.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (temporal-next: X event2)
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” (temporal-F: at some future state we are in a state from which the next state is event2; formally F(X event2)).

4) How they relate — reachability analysis
- From the initial state 1 there are two possible first steps:
  - Path A: 1 -> 2. Here C1 already holds at the initial state (the next state is event2), so C2 holds on this run.
  - Path B: 1 -> 4 -> 3. From 4 the next is 3, and 3 is terminal. On this run C1 never holds (neither at 1 nor at 4 nor at 3), so C2 does not hold on this run.
- Because there is at least one possible execution (1 -> 4 -> 3) where C2 never becomes true, C2 is not guaranteed from the initial state.

Conclusion
- If the question is whether C2 is guaranteed on all possible executions (universal/valid): False.
- If the question is whether there exists some execution where C2 eventually holds (satisfiable/existential): True (e.g., 1 -> 2 ...).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (Read naturally as: whenever event1 occurs in a run, event2 will occur as a consequence — i.e. eventually after that occurrence.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — i.e. in every possible valid execution (every allowed sequence of events), C1 is true.

(NB: there is a possible alternative interpretation of C1 as “if event1 happens, then event2 happens at some point in the whole run (possibly before event1).” I treat C1 in the usual causal/temporal sense — event2 must occur as a consequence of event1 — below I note the alternative interpretation outcome.)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Construct a valid run that violates C1 (under the usual temporal reading):
  1. Start: event2 (given).
  2. After this event2, choose event1 (allowed by the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event4 must happen"").
  3. After this event1, choose event4 (allowed by the rule ""after event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen"").
  4. After event4, no further events can happen, so no event2 occurs after the event1.

- In that run event1 did happen but event2 did not happen after it, so C1 is false in that execution. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Optional note on ambiguity
- If C1 were intended to mean “if event1 happens then event2 occurs somewhere in the run (possibly earlier)”, then because event2 is guaranteed initially, C1 would trivially hold in every run and C2 would be true. But with the usual temporal/causal reading (event2 must follow event1), C2 is false (counterexample trace above).  

Final answer: C2 is False (under the standard temporal reading).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample run (allowed by the rules): event2 (initial) → event1 → event4. Here event1 occurs but no event2 occurs afterward (event4 is terminal), so ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" does not hold in all executions; therefore C2 is false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 occurred initially.

2) Transition rules (from the context)
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: event3 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.
(Several rules were repeated in the context; the above is the set of distinct rules.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (So the immediate next event after the initial event3 is event1.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event4 happens.” (Interpreted as: whenever event1 is the next event, event4 will occur — at some subsequent point the hypothesis requires event4.)

4) How they relate and truth of C2
- From the rule for event3, after the initial event3 the next event may be event1 or event4. So C1 is possible but not guaranteed.
- If C1 holds (i.e., the next event is event1), the rule for event1 requires the following event to be event2 or event3 — it does not force event4 immediately.
- A concrete counterexample sequence that respects all rules but makes C1 true while event4 never occurs:
  initial: event3
  next: event1 (so C1 is true)
  next: event3 (allowed after event1)
  next: event1 (allowed after event3)
  ... and so on, repeating event1 ↔ event3 forever, never choosing event4.
- Because such a valid run exists where C1 is true but event4 never happens, the implication “if C1 then event4” is not guaranteed by the rules.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it is given that initially event2 happened).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen. (i.e. event3 → (event2 or event4))
- After event2, event1 must happen. (i.e. event2 → event1)
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen. (i.e. event4 → (event1 or event2))
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (i.e. event1 → (event2 or event3))
- (The last rule is repeated but identical to the previous.)

These are nondeterministic branching rules (where a choice of one of the listed successors may be made when a rule gives alternatives).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This is a statement that both event2 and event1 occur (at least once) in the execution.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Two reasonable readings:
  a) Universal-existence reading (typical in liveness/trace reasoning): In every possible continuation/run from the initial state, C1 is true (i.e., in every run both event2 and event1 occur at some point).
  b) Invariant reading: At every moment/state from now on, C1 holds (i.e., at every moment both event2 and event1 are true simultaneously). (This is a much stronger and usually unnatural reading for ""always"" applied to event occurrences.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? (and final answer)
- Because event2 has happened initially, we can apply the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen."" That rule forces event1 to occur in every continuation after the initial event2. Therefore in every possible run starting from the given initial condition, both event2 (it already happened initially) and event1 (must happen next) occur. So under reading (3a) above, C1 holds in every run — C1 is inevitable.

- Therefore C2 is True under the usual trace/liveness interpretation (3a): in all possible continuations C1 holds.

- However, under the invariant reading (3b) — that C1 must hold at every moment (i.e., at every state both events are simultaneously true continuously) — C2 would be False, because events are occurrences in time and they do not both hold continuously at every future moment.

Short answer: C2 is True if ""always"" means ""in every possible run, both event2 and event1 occur"" (the usual interpretation here). If ""always"" is taken to mean ""at every state/timepoint from now on both events hold simultaneously,"" then C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events referenced: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (stated twice — redundant)
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; logically it reduces to ""Event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 occurs).
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 ≡ ""event2 happens"", C2 is equivalent to ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- The rules explicitly state ""After event3, event2 must happen."" That is exactly the same as ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" Therefore C2 is true (and, given the initial event3, C1 also follows for that occurrence of event3).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

(“After X must happen Y” is read as a rule forcing the next/next-sometime event(s); the system is otherwise nondeterministic where a choice is allowed among the specified options.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens” — there exists some future point where event3 occurs.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” — at some future point, the statement “event3 eventually happens” becomes true. In temporal logic this is equivalent to “event3 eventually happens” (F F p ≡ F p), so C2 is semantically the same as C1.

4) How the rules relate and evaluation
- From the initial event1, the rules force a sequence among {event1, event2, event4}: event1 → event4 → (event1 or event2) → event4 → ...
- There is no rule that ever produces event3. Event3 appears only on the left of a rule (if event3 happens then something must follow), but nothing forces or implies that event3 will ever occur.
- Therefore there are valid executions (for example the infinite trace event1, event4, event1, event4, … or event1, event4, event2, event4, event2, …) in which event3 never occurs. In those executions C1 is false, and hence C2 is false as well.

Conclusion: C2 is False (because C1 is not guaranteed, and C2 is equivalent to C1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event1 the system is forced into the cycle {event1,event2,event4} (event1→event4→event1 or event2→event4→…). There is no rule that can ever produce event3, so ""event3 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed. Since C2 is equivalent to ""event3 eventually happens"", C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the run starts with event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (3 → 1)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (1 → {2,3})
- After event2, event1 must happen. (2 → 1)
- After event4, event2 must happen. (4 → 2)

(“Must” means the next event is constrained as above; the only nondeterminism is the choice between 2 or 3 after event1.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens” — i.e., in the run starting from the initial condition, there is some future step at which event1 occurs.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — the negation of C1 (event1 never occurs).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate / evaluation
- Start at event4. By the rule 4 → 2, the next event must be event2.
- From event2, 2 → 1, so the next event must be event1.
- Thus, in every possible run from the initial condition we get the sequence 4, 2, 1, so event1 does occur (indeed it occurs deterministically after two steps).
- Therefore C1 is true, and C2 (the negation) is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

1) Events and initial conditions

- Initial condition: event2 happened (so event2 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules (what may follow each event)

- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event4 → one of {event2, event3} must happen.
(Note: the ""after event4"" rule is repeated but says the same thing.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is redundant and simplifies to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = NOT(C1) = ""Event2 does not happen.""

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C2 is simply the negation of C1, so they cannot both be true.
- Because the initial condition states event2 happened, C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is the current/most recent state).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3. (This rule is written twice but is the same.)
- After event2, the next event must be event3.
- After event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}. (This rule is written twice but is the same.)
- After event4, the next event must be either event2 or event3.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” (I take “next state” as the immediate next event after the current one.)
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” Given the context, “Event1 happens” is true for the initial state (we are told event1 happened).

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the rules, because the current event is event1, the immediate next event must be event2 or event3. Therefore the immediate next event cannot be event4.
- So C1 (event4 happens in the next state) is false under the standard reading of “next state” = immediate next event.
- C2 is the conjunction “Event1 happened AND C1”. Event1 did happen (true) but C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If instead “next state” were intended to mean “at some future state” rather than the immediate next one, then event4 can be reached via event1 → event2 → event3 → event4, so C1 would be possible and C2 would be true — but that is a different interpretation than the usual meaning of “next.”)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially event4 happened (so event4 is true at the start).
- ""After event4, no other events can happen"" means once event4 has happened, event1–event3 cannot happen later. Given the initial condition, event1, event2, event3 do not (and cannot) happen.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event4 must happen. (event1 → event4)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal — but this does not assert event4 happens.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (event3 → (event1 ∨ event2))
- Plus the initial fact: event4 has already happened and prevents further events.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens."" (C1 = (event2 → event4))
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (C2 = (C1 → event3))

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- In the given scenario event2 never actually happens (because event4 happened initially and blocks further events). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true. So C1 = (event2 → event4) is true (vacuously true) in this scenario.
- But event3 does not happen (again because event4 occurred and blocks other events). So event3 is false.
- C2 = (C1 → event3) therefore has a true antecedent (C1 is true) and a false consequent (event3 is false), so C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event4 already happened so event2 is false, making C1 (event2 → event4) vacuously true. But event3 is false (no events can occur after event4), so C2 (C1 → event3) has a true antecedent and false consequent, hence is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the system starts after event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, no other events can happen (execution terminates).
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4, event2 must happen next.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" Interpreting this as a global/invariant statement: in every state/time point of an execution, event4 occurs (G event4). (If instead one meant “in every run event4 occurs at least once,” the same reasoning below shows that also fails.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting this as F(C1) — there exists a future point after which C1 holds forever (i.e., eventually from some point on event4 holds at all times).

4) How they relate and why C2 is false
- Given the initial condition, the only enabled progression is: event2 → event3 → termination. There is no rule allowing event4 to occur in that run (event4 can only happen after event1, but event1 does not occur and there is no transition to create event1).
- Therefore event4 never occurs in the actual execution starting from the initial condition. So C1 (event4 always happens) is false.
- For C2 (there exists a future point after which event4 always holds) to be true you would need some suffix of the run where event4 holds at every step. But since no event4 ever occurs and the run terminates after event3, no such suffix exists. Hence C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial state the only possible trace is event2 → event3 → termination, so event4 never occurs. Hence C1 (""event4 always happens"") is false in every suffix, so C2 (""eventually C1 holds"") is also false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the current state is one where event2 has just occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event4 must happen (the next state after an event2 is an event4).
- After event4: event2 must happen (the next state after an event4 is an event2).
- After event3: no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Taken together, from the initial event2 the system is forced into an alternating cycle: event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → ...; event1 and event3 never occur on any reachable path.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Formally, C1 = next(event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally, C2 = next(C1) = next(next(event1)). So C2 asserts that event1 will occur two steps from now.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- From the initial state (event2):
  - next state (one step ahead) must be event4 (because after event2 event4 must happen). So C1 (event1 in the next state) is false.
  - the state two steps ahead must be event2 (because after event4 event2 must happen). Thus next(next(event1)) is false as well.
- Therefore C2 (which requires event1 two steps from now) is False.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (current state = event4).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 ⇒ next is either event3 or event4.
- After event3 ⇒ next is either event1 or event2.
- After event4 ⇒ next is either event1 or event3.
- After event2 ⇒ next is either event1 or event3.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “event1 happens or event2 happens” (i.e. current state satisfies event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” (i.e. in the immediate successor state, event1 ∨ event2).

Step 4 — how they relate / conclusion
- From the initial state event4, the next state must be either event1 or event3 (by the rule for event4).
- If the next state is event1, then C1 holds in that next state.
- But if the next state is event3, then C1 does not hold in that next state (event3 ≠ event1 and ≠ event2).
- Because event3 is an allowed successor of event4, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true. Providing a concrete counterexample trace: event4 (initial) → event3 (next) — here C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial state event4 the next state may be event3 (since after event4 ⇒ event1 or event3). In that successor state C1 (event1 ∨ event2) is false, so C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is not guaranteed. Thus C2 is False."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (that is the starting point).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P). It is always true regardless of the system.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This is true exactly when (a) C1 holds (it does) and (b) event2 happens. So the truth of C2 reduces to whether event2 happens in the scenario under consideration.

Important note about ""happens"": there are two natural readings:
- Existential reading: ""event2 happens"" means there exists some possible execution (some future) in which event2 occurs.
- Universal/inevitable reading: ""event2 happens"" means in all possible executions from the initial state, event2 will occur (it is guaranteed).

Step 4 — how the rules determine whether event2 happens, and final answer about C2
- From the initial event4 the forced chain begins: event4 → event3 → event1. After event1 we must choose either event2 or event3.
  - There is a run where we choose event2: event4 → event3 → event1 → event2 (then stop). So under the existential reading, event2 does occur in some possible execution.
  - There is also a run where we choose event3 instead: event4 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... (this can repeat indefinitely), so event2 never occurs in that run. Therefore event2 is not guaranteed in every execution.

Conclusion about C2
- Under the existential interpretation (""there exists a run where event2 happens""): C2 is True (C1 is true and event2 does occur in some run).
- Under the universal/inevitable interpretation (""event2 must happen in every run""): C2 is False (event2 is not forced; there are runs that never reach event2).

If you have a specific interpretation of ""happens"" (existential vs. inevitable), tell me which one and I will state the single final truth value accordingly.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.
- Note: the context repeats a couple of rules, but the essential facts are as above.

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event3: next event must be either event2 or event4.
- After event2: next event must be either event1, event3, or event4.
- After event4: next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is a terminal state).

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: the state formula ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this as a state-level implication: in any given state, whenever event1 is true then event2 must also be true in that same state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the immediate successor state (the next state after the current one) the formula C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- In the initial state event1 is true. By the transition rules, after event1 no further events occur, so in that state event2 is not true. Therefore C1 (event1 → event2) is false in the initial state.
- Moreover, because event1 is terminal there is no next state at all. In standard temporal/logical semantics the formula ""C1 holds in the next state"" requires that a next state exists and C1 is true there; since no next state exists, C2 is false.
- Even under alternative readings (e.g. ""if event1 ever happens then later event2 happens""), the absence of any future after event1 makes such implications fail as well.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state has event1 true and is terminal (no successor), so C1 (event1 → event2) is already false in that state and there is no next state in which C1 could hold; therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules (constraints)
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur later.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur later.
- After event3 occurs, event2 must occur later.
- After event4 occurs, event1 must occur later.

(Interpretation: these are liveness obligations — whenever the left-hand event occurs, the right-hand event must occur at some later time.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event4 eventually happens” (there exists some time when event4 occurs).
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens” i.e. (event4 eventually happens) AND (event1 happens at some time).

4) How they relate and evaluation of C2
- From the rules and the initial event2, we can deduce event1 must happen (because “after event2, event1 must happen”).
- Once event1 happens, event2 must happen again, then event1 again, etc. So a perfectly valid behavior satisfying all constraints is an infinite alternation of event2, event1, event2, event1, ... with no event3 and no event4 ever occurring.
- Nothing in the rules forces event4 to ever happen. So C1 is not guaranteed by the context (it may be false in some valid traces).
- Because C2 = C1 AND (event1 happens), and event1 is guaranteed but C1 is not, C2 is not guaranteed either.

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true (i.e., it is not entailed by the given information). There exist valid traces (for example: initial event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, ... forever) where C1 is false and therefore C2 is false. C2 can be true in some traces (if event4 does occur), but it is not guaranteed.

4) How the conditions relate; conclusion
- Start from the initial event3. The rule for event3 requires that the next event is one of {event1, event2, event4}.
  - If the choice is event1, then event1 occurs and C1 is satisfied.
  - If the choice is event2, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 will occur next (so C1 is satisfied).
  - If the choice is event4, the rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 will occur next (so C1 is satisfied).
- In every possible branch allowed by the rules starting from the initial event3, event1 inevitably occurs. Therefore C1 holds in every allowed execution, so C2 is True.

- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds” — both that event2 occurs and that event4 eventually happens.

4) How the conditions relate / truth value of C2
- From the rules there are two possible minimal sequences after event1:
  - Sequence A: event1 → event2 → event3 → event4
  - Sequence B: event1 → event3 → event4
  (If event2 also occurs in addition to event3 that still leads to event4 via event3.)
- In both sequences A and B, event3 occurs (either directly or after event2) and therefore event4 must follow. Thus event4 is inevitable: C1 is true (entailed).
- However, event2 is not inevitable: sequence B shows a permitted future where event2 does not occur. Therefore the conjunct “event2 happens” is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true (i.e., false as an entailment). C2 is possible in some runs (e.g., sequence A) but not guaranteed in all runs.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs the next event is event1).
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen next (a nondeterministic choice).
- After event3, event1 must happen next.
- After event4, event3 must happen next (which then forces event1 next).
So the allowed immediate transitions are:
1 -> {2,3,4}; 2 -> 1; 3 -> 1; 4 -> 3 -> 1.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is the same as simply ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting “always” as “in every execution / at every relevant point (globally) C1 is true.” In other words C2 asserts that event2 occurs in every execution (or at every step, depending on intended semantics).

4) Relation and evaluation
- Do the rules force event2 to occur in every execution? No. From the initial event1, the system may choose event3 (or event4) instead of event2. For example, the infinite trace
  1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, ...
  is allowed by the rules (1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...), and event2 never occurs in that trace. Hence C1 can be false in some executions.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false: there exists an allowed execution where C1 does not hold.

Extra notes
- If one intended a different reading of “after” (e.g. “eventually after X, Y must happen”), the same counterexample works: from 1 you can always choose 3 forever, so event2 need not occur eventually.
- C1 can be true in some executions (e.g. 1,2,1,2,...) but it is not guaranteed in all executions, so C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event1 the system can choose the transition 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... so event2 never occurs in that execution. Thus ""event2 always holds"" is not guaranteed."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state S0, event4 happened.

2) Transition rules (what can happen after each event)
- After event1 → next state must be event2 or event4.
- After event2 → next state must be event3 or event4.
- After event3 → next state must be event1 or event4.
- After event4 → next state must be event2 or event3.
(Notes: the description repeats some rules but these are the effective transitions.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event4 happens and event1 happens.” Interpreting this as a state formula: C1 holds in a state only if both event4 and event1 are true in that same state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That asserts that in the immediately following state (S1) both event4 and event1 are true simultaneously.

4) Relating the conditions to the transitions
- From S0 (event4), the transition rule for event4 requires the next state S1 to be either event2 or event3. Thus S1 cannot be event4, and certainly cannot simultaneously be event1 and event4.
- Therefore S1 does not satisfy “event4 and event1” together, so C1 does not hold in the next state. Hence C2 is False.

(If one instead read C1 as “event4 happens at some time and event1 happens at some (possibly different) time,” then event4 already happened in S0 and event1 can occur later along some paths — but C2, which asks that both hold in the immediate next state, is still false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: S0 has event4. The rule for event4 forces S1 to be event2 or event3, so S1 cannot have event4 (and hence cannot simultaneously have event1 and event4). Therefore C1 (""event4 and event1"" in the same state) does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen (one of them must follow).
- After event3, no other events can happen (3 is terminal).
- After event2, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (C1 = event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (C2 = C1 ∨ event1). Note this simplifies logically: (event2 ∧ event1) ∨ event1 = event1. So C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- From the rule “after event4, event1 must happen” and the initial fact that event4 happened, event1 indeed must happen. Therefore event1 is true.
- Hence C2 (equivalent to event1) is true.
- (For completeness: C1 requires event2 as well; nothing in the rules forces event2 to occur, so C1 is not guaranteed and is generally false given only the provided facts.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (possible next events)
- After event2: next ∈ {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1: next = event4.
- After event4: next ∈ {event1, event3}.
- After event3: next ∈ {event2, event4}.

(Equivalently, directed edges: 2→{1,3,4}, 1→{4}, 4→{1,3}, 3→{2,4}.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting this as: at every future step the event that occurs is event3 (i.e., from now on, every event is event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting this as: there exists some time after which C1 is true — i.e., from some point onward, all events are event3 (eventually always event3).

4) Relation and conclusion
- Observe: from event3 the next event must be either event2 or event4 (so a transition 3→3 does not exist). Thus you cannot have two consecutive event3 occurrences; in particular you cannot have a tail of the execution where every step is event3.
- Equivalently, no state has only event3 as its successor, so it is impossible to reach a point where the only possible next event is event3 forever.
- Therefore C1 is false (event3 does not always hold). More importantly, C2 is false: it is impossible that at some future time C1 becomes true (there is no point after which all events are event3).

(As an extra note: there are runs that never produce event3 — e.g., 2 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → … — so both “always event3” and “eventually always event3” are impossible.)

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially event4 happened (the initial state has event4 true).

2) Transition rules (from the description)
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is a terminal state: no successor).
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen (event1 → next is event2 or event3 or event4).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, event4 must happen (event3 → next is event4).

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as: in a given state, event4 → event1 (i.e., whenever event4 is true in that state, event1 is also true in that same state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted as the temporal Next operator: X(C1) — C1 must be true in the immediate successor state.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- In the initial state event4 is true but event1 is not (we were told initially event4 happened; there is no indication event1 also happened). So C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state. But after event4 there is no next state (event4 is terminal). Under the standard semantics for the Next operator (Xφ is false if there is no successor), X(C1) is false. Therefore C2 is false.

(If one used a nonstandard semantics that treats ""next"" from a terminal state as vacuously true, you could get a different answer, but under the usual temporal logic semantics C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C2 is X(C1) (C1 must hold in the immediate successor). The initial state has event4 and is terminal (no successor), and under standard temporal-logic semantics Xφ is false when there is no successor. Therefore C2 is false."

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (that is the starting point).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event2 → event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (event4 → event2 OR event4 → event3).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" In the runs starting from the initial condition, there is a point at which event3 occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally: (Event3 eventually happens) implies (event1 happens at some point).
(There is no C3 given.)

4) How do these conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- From the rules, starting from event4 the possible immediate continuations are:
  a) event4 → event3 (choose event3 directly), then execution stops.
  b) event4 → event2 → event3 (choose event2, then rule forces event3), then execution stops.
- In both possible executions event3 does eventually happen. Thus C1 is true.
- In neither execution does event1 ever occur: there is no rule allowing event1 to occur after event4, after event2, or after event3 (and event3 is terminal). So event1 never happens in any allowed run.
- Therefore C1 can hold without event1 occurring. The implication ""C1 ⇒ event1"" is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False. Counterexample trace: event4 → event3 (satisfies C1, does not have event1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: start with event4 → event3. Here C1 holds (event3 occurs) but event1 never occurs. Thus ""if C1 then event1"" is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events present: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (this is the starting point).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event4 must happen (so event4 will occur after event3).
- After event4, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after event4).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event4 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 occurs).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (a claim that event1 never occurs in the run).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all runs / at all times, event1 does not happen (equivalently: event1 never happens).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the rules and the initial condition: event3 ⇒ event4 ⇒ event1, so starting from the initial state (event3 happened) event1 must occur and then the execution stops.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false in this scenario.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

So C2 is False.

I'll answer each part step by step and then say whether C2 is true (noting the two possible interpretations: existential vs universal).

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened (the current/initial state is after event3).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2: the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event1: no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3: the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- After event4: the next event must be event1.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e., in the immediate successor state the event is event4.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Two readings:
  - Existential reading: there exists some future time at which C1 is true (there is some execution where at some point the immediate next event is event4).
  - Universal reading: in every possible future execution eventually C1 becomes true (inevitably, at some time the next event will be event4).

4) How do these conditions relate and does C2 hold?
- From the initial event3, the immediate next event must be either event2 or event4.
  - If we choose event4 next, the sequence is 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> (stop). In this run C1 is true at the initial state (and thus C2 is satisfied).
  - If we choose event2 next, a possible continuation is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> (stop). In this run C1 never holds: the next events were 2 then 1, and after 1 nothing happens.

Conclusion about C2:
- Under the existential reading (there exists a run where C1 eventually holds): C2 is True (e.g., 3 -> 4 -> 1).
- Under the universal reading (in every possible run C1 eventually holds): C2 is False, because the run 3 -> 2 -> 1 never reaches a state whose next event is event4 (so C1 never holds there).

If you intended one of those readings in particular, the relevant single answer is:
- If you mean ""eventually C1 must happen in all possible executions"": C2 is False (counterexample 3->2->1).
- If you mean ""there is some execution where eventually C1 happens"": C2 is True (example 3->4->1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start at event3, take event2 next, then event1: sequence 3 -> 2 -> 1. In this run C1 (""event4 happens in the next state"") never holds, so C2 (that C1 eventually holds in every possible future) is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has already happened (the system starts in the state ""after event4"").

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event2: the next event must be one of event1, event3, or event4.
- After event1: the next event must be event2 or event3.
- After event3: the next event must be event1.
- After event4: no further events can happen (event4 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted naturally: in every possible execution (trace) of the system, event2 occurs at some point.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that the property C1 is true for the system (i.e., C1 is true in the actual system/traces).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because the system starts after event4 and event4 is terminal, there is a valid execution consisting of just [event4]. In that execution event2 does not occur.
- That single counterexample is enough to falsify C1 (it is not true that event2 occurs in every execution).
- Since C1 is false, the statement C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Therefore C2 is False (and C1 is False).

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., C1 is true under the system rules.)

4) How the conditions relate; conclusion
- From the rules for 2 and 4 we get a forced alternation: starting from event2, the system must do event4 next, then event2, then event4, … ad infinitum. That trace is: 2,4,2,4,...
- No rule allows a transition from {event2, event4} to event1 or event3. Thus there exists a valid execution (the infinite 2↔4 cycle) that never contains event1.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 is not guaranteed). Since C1 is not guaranteed, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens.” Interpreted naturally as “both events occur (at some point) in the run.”
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreted as “C1 is true (holds) in the system” — e.g. in the initial run or in all runs, depending on reading. Under either reading this asserts that both event1 and event2 occur (now or in every reachable execution).

4) How they relate / reasoning
- The initial state already has event1 happened.
- The rule “after event1, no other events can happen” means once we are in the initial state (event1), the system cannot produce any further events. In particular, event2 can never occur after the initial event1.
- Therefore C1 (both event1 and event2 happened) is false in the actual system (event2 never occurs).
- Since C1 is false, the claim “C1 always holds” (C2) is false.

Short counterexample: the initial state (event1 happened, event2 did not) falsifies C1, so C2 is false.

- If event4 happens in a state, then event2 must happen in the immediate next state.
- If event2 happens in a state, then the immediate next state must have either event1 or event3.
- If event1 happens in a state, then the immediate next state must have event4.
- If event3 happens in a state, then the immediate next state must have either event1 or event4.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e., event2 occurs in s1 (the state immediately after the initial state s0).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — i.e., event2 happens (somewhere) AND event2 occurs in the next state (C1).

4) How the rules apply from the initial state
- From s0 (event3), the rule for event3 forces s1 to be either event1 or event4.
  - Case A: s1 = event1. Then by the rule for event1, s2 must be event4. Then by the rule for event4, s3 must be event2. So event2 occurs, but at s3 (two steps after s1), not in s1.
  - Case B: s1 = event4. Then by the rule for event4, s2 must be event2. So event2 occurs, but in s2 (again not in s1).

In neither possible immediate next state s1 is event2. So C1 (event2 in the next state) is false.

Because C2 requires C1 to be true (it includes ""C1 holds""), C2 is also false — even though event2 will occur eventually in every branch, it does not occur in the immediate next state, so C1 is false and thus C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (so we are at a state whose previous event was event2, and we consider what must happen in the next state).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3 → {event1, event2, or event4} (one of these must happen).
- After event1 → event4 must happen.
- After event2 → {event1 or event4} (one of these must happen).
- After event4 → {event1 or event3} (this line is repeated but conveys the same rule).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “Event1 happens OR C1 holds,” i.e. “Event1 happens in the next state OR event4 happens in the next state.” So C2 is exactly “the next state is either event1 or event4.”

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition (event2 happened) the rule “After event2 → {event1 or event4}” forces the next state to be either event1 or event4.
- That forced disjunction is exactly what C2 states.
- Therefore C2 must be true. (C1 alone is not guaranteed, because the next state could be event1 instead of event4; but C2, the disjunction, is guaranteed.)

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (the initial state is event3).

Step 2 — Transition rules
- After event3, the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event4.
- After event4, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- After event1, the next event must be either event3 or event4.
(Notice the rule for event4 is repeated but equivalent.)

These rules define the allowed infinite sequences of events starting from the initial event3.

Step 3 — Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens.” (Taken in the usual sense, “eventually” means at some time now or later along the execution.)
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e. event3 never happens (no occurrence of event3 anywhere in the execution).

Step 4 — Relation and verdict
- Because the initial state already has event3, C1 is satisfied immediately. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is false.
- Conclusion: C2 is False.

Note on an alternative reading: if by “eventually” you meant “event3 occurs again at some later time strictly after the initial step,” then some executions avoid any further event3 (e.g. event3 → event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → …), so under that stricter interpretation there exist runs where C1 (read that way) is false and C2 true for those runs. But under the standard interpretation that includes the current/initial occurrence, C1 holds and C2 is false.

False

Reason: C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is already satisfied by the initial occurrence of event3, so its negation C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (the execution starts immediately after an occurrence of event3).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event3 must happen (event2 → event3).
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen (event3 → {event1, event2}).
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen (event4 → {event1, event3}).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event4 always happens” — interpreted as: in every possible execution (every possible allowed trace starting from the initial event3) event4 occurs at some point. (i.e. event4 is inevitable/universal).
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds” — both of these must be true: (a) event2 occurs (in the execution under consideration or in all executions, depending on intended quantification — here we treat the hypothesis as asserting the facts as global/inevitable), and (b) event4 always happens.

4) How the conditions relate / evaluation
- From the rules, after the initial event3 we must choose either event1 or event2.
  - If we choose event1 next, rule “after event1 no other events can happen” ends the trace: sequence 3 → 1. In that trace event4 never occurs and event2 does not occur.
  - If we choose event2 next, we get 3 → 2 → 3, and from that 3 again either 1 or 2 must happen, so we can have sequences like 3 → 2 → 3 → 1 (ends) or potentially infinite alternation 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... etc. In these traces event2 can occur, but event4 still need not occur.
- Crucially, there is at least one valid trace (3 → 1) in which event4 does not occur. Therefore C1 (“event4 always happens”) is false.
- Since C1 is false, the conjunction in C2 (event2 happens AND C1 holds) cannot be true. (Also event2 is not guaranteed either, because the trace 3 → 1 avoids event2.)

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: from the initial event3 we can choose 3 → 1, which terminates and contains neither event2 nor event4. Thus ""event4 always happens"" (C1) is false, so the conjunction C2 (event2 happens and C1) is false."

Step 4 — relate and evaluate
- The next state after the initial event1 must be either event2 or event3.
  - If next state = event2: then event2 is true in that state and event4 is not (they are different events in the same state). The implication (event2 → event4) is false. So C1 is false in this next state.
  - If next state = event3: then event2 is false in that state, so the implication (event2 → event4) is vacuously true. So C1 is true in this next state.
- Because the next state could be event2 (making C1 false) or event3 (making C1 true), C2 is not guaranteed to hold.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event3 happened.

(I'm assuming ""initially"" and ""after"" refer to a sequence of discrete states, exactly one event happens per state, and ""after X"" means in the immediate next state. If you meant a different semantics, the conclusion might change.)

2) Transition rules (interpreted as constraints on the immediate next state)
- If event4 occurs in a state, then event2 must occur in the next state.
- If event2 occurs in a state, then event4 must occur in the next state.
- If event1 occurs in a state, then in the next state either event2 or event4 must occur.
- If event3 occurs in a state, then in the next state either event2 or event4 must occur.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at s0, C1 means s1 contains event1.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted from s0, C2 means there exists some future state sk such that at that state the next state contains event1 — equivalently, that event1 occurs at some (non-initial) state in the future.

4) How the rules relate and the conclusion
- From s0 (event3), the rule for event3 forces s1 to be either event2 or event4.
- If s1 = event2, then by the event2 rule s2 must be event4; then by event4 rule s3 must be event2; and so on. This forces an infinite alternation ...2,4,2,4,... with no possibility of event1.
- If s1 = event4, the same alternation follows (4 → 2 → 4 → 2 ...), again never producing event1.
- There is no rule that allows event1 to appear later once we reach the 2↔4 cycle, and the rules for 2 and 4 force only each other.

Therefore:
- C1 evaluated at the initial state s0 is false (s1 cannot be event1).
- C2 is false: there is no future state at which the ""next state has event1"" — event1 never occurs under the given rules.

So C2 is False (under the stated interpretations).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: from s0 (event3) s1 must be event2 or event4. Both choices lead to the forced alternation 2→4→2→4… (since 2 forces 4 next and 4 forces 2 next), so event1 can never occur at any future state. Hence C1 is false at s0 and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the sequence starts at event4).

Step 2 — transition rules
- From event4: the next event must be either event1 or event2. (4 -> {1,2})
- From event1: the next event must be either event2 or event4. (1 -> {2,4})
- From event2: the next event must be either event1 or event4. (2 -> {1,4})
- From event3: the next event must be event1. (3 -> {1})
Note: the rule for event2 was repeated but is the same; there is no transition into event3 from the given rules, so event3 is not reachable from the initial event4.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the natural way for these transition systems: C1 claims that in every possible future (every possible infinite or finite run starting from the initial event4) event1 occurs (i.e., event1 is inevitable). (If you meant a stronger reading, e.g., “event1 happens at every step,” the same counterexample below still refutes that.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is the conjunction: (C1 is true) AND (event1 happens). If C1 is false, C2 cannot be true. If C1 is true, C2 just restates that event1 does happen (redundant under the usual reading of C1).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation
- From the transition graph you can choose nondeterministically at each step. Starting at event4 you may choose either event1 or event2.
- A counterexample run that shows event1 is not inevitable: choose event4 -> event2 -> event4 -> event2 -> ... forever. This infinite run uses the allowed choices (4 -> 2, 2 -> 4) and never visits event1.
- Because such a run exists, C1 (""event1 always happens"" / event1 is inevitable) is false.
- Therefore C2, which requires C1 to hold (and that event1 happens), is also false.

Final answer
C2 is False.

Step-by-step.

1) Events involved and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (it occurred first).

2) Transition rules (what can/cannot happen after each event)
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event3 happens."" (a material implication: event4 → event3).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (C2 = C1 ∧ event2).

4) How the conditions relate and final truth values
- From the initial condition, event4 did happen.
- But rule “after event4, no other events can happen” makes event4 terminal: no events (including event3 or event2) can occur after it.
- Therefore event3 did not happen (it cannot occur after event4, and there is no earlier occurrence allowed because event4 happened initially).
- Evaluate C1: antecedent (event4) is true, consequent (event3) is false → the implication event4 → event3 is false. So C1 is false.
- Evaluate event2: event2 did not happen (it cannot occur after the initial event4). So event2 is false.
- Evaluate C2 = (C1 holds) ∧ event2: C1 is false and event2 is false, so C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event4 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event4 → next state must be event1 or event3.
- After event1 → next state must be event2 or event4.
- After event3 → next state must be event2.
- After event2 → next state must be event3. (This last rule is given twice but is the same rule.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" Interpreting relative to t0, C1 asserts event4 occurs at t1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreting relative to t0, C2 asserts that at t1 the proposition C1 is true — i.e., event4 occurs at t2.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- From t0 (event4), the rule forces t1 ∈ {event1, event3}. So C1 (event4 at t1) is false at t0 (event4 cannot occur immediately after event4).
- For C2 (event4 at t2): consider the two possible t1 cases:
  - If t1 = event1, then t2 ∈ {event2, event4} — event4 at t2 is possible but not required.
  - If t1 = event3, then t2 = event2 — event4 at t2 is impossible in this branch.
- Because there is at least one allowed branch (t1 = event3 → t2 = event2) where event4 does not happen at t2, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer
- C1 (event4 at t1) is false (cannot follow event4 immediately).
- C2 is false as a logically necessary consequence of the given information (it is possible in some runs but not required).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial event: event4 occurs at the start.

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event3 → event1 must happen next.
- After event1 → no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 → next is either event1 or event4.
- After event4 → event1 must happen next.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this in standard temporal logic: C1 = G(event2) — at every step/event, event2 holds (i.e., event2 occurs at every point).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted as F C1 = F G(event2) — there is some future point after which event2 holds at every step (eventually always event2).

(If you intended a different natural-language meaning for ""always"" — e.g. “occurs at least once” — tell me and I’ll re-evaluate. The standard reading of “always” is global (G).)

4) How the rules determine truth of C1 and C2
- From the initial event4 and the rule “after event4 → event1 must happen,” the only possible initial prefix is: event4, then event1.
- From “after event1 → no other events can happen,” the trace ends after event1. So a complete trace is: [event4, event1] and then termination.
- There is no rule that allows event2 to occur from the initial state or after event4/event1. Thus event2 never occurs in any reachable trace.
- Therefore C1 (G(event2)) is false (not even a single occurrence of event2, let alone always).
- Consequently C2 (F G(event2)) is also false: there is no future point from which event2 holds at every step (there are no further steps where event2 ever appears).

Extra notes on relationships
- In general, C1 ⇒ C2 (if event2 already always holds then it trivially eventually always holds). But not vice versa.
- In this system neither C1 nor C2 holds; a concrete counterexample trace is the actual trace starting at the initial state: event4 → event1, with no event2.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event4 the only possible continuation is event1 which is terminal, so event2 never occurs; therefore there is no future point from which event2 holds always, so F G(event2) is false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened in the initial state (call it state0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event4 must happen in the next state. (event1 -> next event4)
- After event4, event1 must happen in the next state. (event4 -> next event1)
- After event2, event4 must happen in the next state. (event2 -> next event4)
- After event3, event1 must happen in the next state. (event3 -> next event1)

(“Must happen” means the listed successor event is required; nothing in the rules requires event2 or forbids extra events unless stated.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Concretely, from state0 it claims event1 occurs in state1.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” A conditional: if event1 occurs in the next state, then event2 occurs (presumably in that same next state or subsequently, but interpreted as “event2 happens as consequence of event1”).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the rules: initial event3 at state0 implies event1 at state1. So C1 is true (entails).
- From the rules, event1 requires event4 in the following state (state2). There is no rule that forces event2 to occur after event1 (event1 -> event4, not event2). Also nothing in the context forces event2 at any point. Therefore C2 (“if C1 then event2”) is not entailed by the given rules.
- So, given the provided context, C2 is False (not guaranteed). Note: C2 could be true in some model only if additional unspecified rules or concurrent occurrences allow event2, but with only the stated rules it does not follow.

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened (the system starts in a state where event3 just occurred).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""After X, Y must happen"" as ""immediately next event after X must be one of Y"")
- After event1 → the next event must be event3.
- After event3 → the next event must be either event1 or event2.
- After event2 → the next event must be event3.
- After event4 → no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event4 happens."" (Both events occur sometime in the trace.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as an invariant across all possible runs/traces (i.e., in every possible execution, C1 is true).

4) How the conditions relate and the conclusion
- From the initial event3, the allowed next events are only event1 or event2.
- From event1 or event2 the rules force you back to event3, and from event3 again to 1 or 2. Thus the only reachable events in any trace are event3, event1 and event2, in cycles.
- There is no rule that allows event4 to occur after any reachable event (3,1,2), and the initial state is not event4. Therefore event4 is unreachable under these rules.
- Because event4 cannot occur in any valid trace, C1 (""event1 and event4 happen"") is false in every trace. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

(If you meant a different formal reading of ""must happen"" or ""always"" let me know — I can re-evaluate under that semantics. Under the natural sequential interpretation above, C2 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the rules starting at event3 the system can only cycle through event3→(event1 or event2)→event3, so event4 is never reachable. Thus C1 (""event1 and event4 happen"") is false in every trace, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: the initial state has event2.

2) Transition rules (interpreted as ""if eventX holds now, then in the next state eventY must hold"")
- After event3 → next must be event1.
- After event1 → next must be event2.
- After event2 → next must be either event1 or event4.
- After event4 → next must be event2.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — i.e. at every state from now on event1 holds (formally G event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the immediate successor state the property C1 is true (formally X G event1).

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- From the rules, whenever event1 occurs the next state must be event2. So after any occurrence of event1 there is a state where event1 does not hold. Therefore C1 (event1 at every state) cannot be true at any state.
- In particular, starting from the initial state (event2) the next state must be event1 or event4. Take the branch initial -> event1 -> event2 -> ... In that next state (where event1 holds), C1 would require event1 to hold at every future state, but the very next state after that is event2, so C1 is false there as well.
- Thus C1 is false everywhere, and therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual reading that events are instantaneous occurrences). Below is the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start (i.e. event1 is true at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen: formally, event1 -> eventually(event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen: event2 is terminal (once event2 occurs, no further events occur).
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen: event3 -> eventually(event2 ∨ event4).
- After event4, event3 must happen: event4 -> eventually(event3).

(If you like a temporal-logic sketch: initially event1. event1 -> F event2. event2 -> G(no further events). event3 -> F(event2 ∨ event4). event4 -> F event3.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event1 happens"" — a proposition event4 ∨ event1 holding at a given time.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — the temporal property G(event4 ∨ event1): at every time point, either event4 or event1 holds.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true?
- Construct a trace consistent with the rules: at time 0 event1 happens (given). Because event1 requires event2 later, let event2 happen next. After event2 happens, no further events occur (terminal).
  - Time 0: event1 = true (so C1 true).
  - Time 1: event2 = true, and no other event happens at time 1 (so event1 = false and event4 = false at time 1). Thus C1 is false at time 1.
- Since C1 fails at time 1, C2 = G(event4 ∨ event1) is false on this allowed trace.

Therefore C2 is False under the usual interpretation that events are instantaneous occurrences. (Note: if you instead interpret ""happened"" as a persistent past predicate — i.e. once event1 has happened it remains true forever — then event1 would remain true at all times and C2 would be true. Make sure which semantics you intend.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial fact: event4 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after what)
- After event3, event4 must happen.  (event3 → eventually event4)
- After event4, event2 must happen.  (event4 → eventually event2)
- After event2, event4 must happen.  (event2 → eventually event4)
- After event1, event4 must happen.  (event1 → eventually event4)

From the last three rules we get a required alternation once event4 has occurred: starting from the initial event4, event2 must occur later, then event4 again, then event2, etc. Nothing in these rules forces event1 or event3 to ever occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event3 happens."" C1 is true exactly when at some time event1 or event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""event3 happens"" (if event3 happens then C1 is automatically satisfied, so C2 ⇔ event3 happens).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the truth of C2
- Since C2 ⇔ ""event3 happens"", the question reduces to: does the context force event3 to occur?
- The given rules do not force event3 (they only force the event4↔event2 cycle and force event4 after event1 or event3). Therefore event3 is not entailed by the context.
- Conclusion: C2 is not provably true from the context. It is undetermined/possible but not guaranteed:
  - It can be true in a model where someone causes event3 at some point (then C2 is true).
  - It can be false in a model where only the forced event4↔event2 sequence occurs forever and event3 never happens.

Short answer: C2 is not entailed by the context (undetermined).

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened first.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event1: next must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2: next must be event3.
- After event3: no further events can happen (terminal).
- After event4: next must be either event1 or event2.

(“After event3, no other events can happen” was stated twice; it is just the terminal rule.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — i.e. in the run of events starting from the initial event4, event1 never occurs.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event3 happens” — i.e. in any run where event1 never occurs, event3 does occur.

4) How they relate — explicit case analysis
Starting from initial event4, the next step must be either event1 or event2.

- Branch A: If we choose event1 after event4, then event1 happens (so C1 is false in this branch). Nothing in this branch is required for evaluating C2 because C2’s antecedent (C1) is false here.

- Branch B: If we choose event2 after event4, then by the rule “after event2, event3 must happen,” event3 will occur next, and then the run terminates. In this branch event1 does not occur (C1 is true) and event3 does occur.

There are no other choices. Thus there is no possible run in which event1 never occurs (C1 true) and event3 also fails to occur. In every run where C1 holds, event3 indeed happens.

Conclusion
- C2 is true (entailed by the given rules).

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed true (i.e., not entailed). There is a valid execution where C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happens (at the start).

2) Transition rules (after X → allowed next events)
- After event4 → event2 (must).
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2} (this rule appears twice but is the same).

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" — interpreted as “event3 never occurs” (a global claim). Given the initial condition that event3 happens, C1 is false in the given scenario.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e. (event1 occurs at some point) OR (event3 never occurs).

4) How do these relate and is C2 true?
- Because C1 is false (event3 does happen initially), C2 reduces to the claim “event1 happens.”
- Is event1 guaranteed by the transition rules? No. There is a valid execution that never produces event1, for example:
  event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... 
  (choose event2 after every event3, and choose event3 after every event2). This infinite trace respects all transition rules and never contains event1. In that trace C1 is false (event3 does occur) and event1 does not occur, so C2 is false.
- Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true (not entailed). It can be true in some traces (if event1 eventually occurs) but there exist traces consistent with the rules where C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event4 happens."" (i.e., at some times in the run both event3 and event4 occur.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 means: event4 occurs, event3 occurs, and event1 occurs (all happen somewhere in the execution).

Step 4 — how they relate; is C2 true?
- C2 can be true in some runs. Example where C2 holds:
  - Sequence: 4 (initial) → 1 → 3. Here event4 (initial), event1, and event3 all occur, so C2 is satisfied.
- C2 can also be false in some runs:
  - Example 1 (C1 true but no event1): 4 → 2 → 3 → 4. Here event4 and event3 occur but event1 never does, so C2 is false.
  - Example 2 (C1 false): 4 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → … (loop of 1 and 2 forever). Here event3 never occurs, so C1 (and thus C2) is false.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. It is satisfiable (there exist runs where C2 is true) but not entailed in all runs (there also exist runs where C2 is false). So if you mean “Is C2 necessarily true?” the answer is: False (not necessarily true).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 (e1), event2 (e2), event3 (e3), event4 (e4).
- Initial condition: e4 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules (reading ""After A, B must happen"" as: whenever A occurs, B must occur at some later point)
- After e2, e4 must happen (if e2 occurs then sometime later e4 occurs).
- After e4, e3 must happen.
- After e3, either e1 or e2 must happen.
- After e1, either e2 or e3 must happen.

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""event3 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e., at the considered moment the current event is e3 or e2 (or equivalently: the statement 'e3 ∨ e2' holds at that time).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., at every moment in time the proposition e3 ∨ e2 is true (the global/always operator).

4) How the conditions relate and truth of C2
- From the initial e4, the rules force e3 at some next step (so C1 is true at that next step because e3 occurs).
- But C2 asserts C1 holds at every moment. That fails immediately at the initial moment: initially e4 occurred, and e4 is neither e3 nor e2, so C1 is false at time 0. Thus C2 is false.
- More generally, there are execution traces that include events other than e2 or e3 (for example the initial e4, and possible occurrences of e1), so C1 is not globally true. Example traces:
  - t0: e4 (C1 false) → t1: e3 (C1 true) → t2: e1 (C1 false).
  - or t0: e4 (false) → t1: e3 (true) → t2: e2 (true) → t3: e4 (false) → ...
  Either way, there are times when neither e2 nor e3 are happening, so C1 does not hold always.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: at the initial moment e4 holds, so C1 (e3 ∨ e2) is false there. Since C2 requires C1 to hold at every moment, C2 is false. Example trace: t0: e4 (C1 false) → t1: e3 (C1 true) → t2: e1 (C1 false)."

Answer first, then the step-by-step reasoning:

Conclusion: C2 is False (because C1 is False).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).

2) Transition rules between events (given):
- After event1, event4 must happen. (event1 → event4 next)
- After event4, no other events can happen. (event4 is terminal)
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen. (event2 → event3 or event4)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → event2)

3) What the sub-conditions mean:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (claims event3 occurs immediately after the current state)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (both event1 is true in the current state and event3 occurs in the next state)

4) How these relate and final evaluation:
- From ""event1 happened"" and ""after event1, event4 must happen"", the next state must contain event4.
- But C1 asserts the next state contains event3. That contradicts the mandatory rule that the next state must be event4. Therefore C1 is False.
- C2 requires event1 (True) AND C1 (False) → False.

So C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Events and initial condition:
   - Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
   - Initial state: event1 happened (so event1 is true now).

2. Transition rules:
   - After event1, event4 must happen in the next state.
   - After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
   - After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
   - After event3, event2 must happen.

3. Interpret hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
   - C2: ""Event1 happens (now) and C1 holds.""

4. Evaluate C1 given the rules:
   - Since event1 happened now, the rule ""after event1, event4 must happen"" forces the next state to contain event4.
   - Because event4 is terminal, no other event (including event3) can occur in that next state.
   - Therefore C1 is false.

5. Evaluate C2:

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state, event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event3 → event1 must happen next.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2 → event1 must happen next.
- After event4 → no other events can happen after it (terminal).

(Implicit modelling assumption I’ll use below: time is discrete, one event occurs per state, and “after X” means “in the next state following a state where X occurred.”)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” From the current state this says: at the immediately next state (one step from now) event1 occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Interpreting literally with the same “next” operator: C2 = “In the next state, C1 is true.” That means: at the next state (call it s1), C1 is true — equivalently, event1 happens in s2 (two steps from now). So C2 asserts event1 occurs two steps from now.

Step 4 — how the rules determine C1 and C2
- Start: current state s0 has event2.
- By “after event2 → event1 must happen”, s1 (the next state) must be event1. So C1 is true at s0 (event1 happens in the next state).
- Now ask whether C2 is true at s0. C2 requires that in s1, C1 be true — i.e., that event1 occurs in s2.
- But the rule “after event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen” applies in s1 (because s1 is event1). So s2 must be either event2 or event3, not event1.
- Therefore event1 cannot (must not) occur in s2 under the given rules (given the single-event-per-state assumption). So C2 is false.

Conclusion
- C1 is true (event1 happens next).
- C2 is false (event1 does not necessarily — and under the rules cannot — happen two steps from now).

Note on assumptions: If you allow multiple simultaneous events per state or a different interpretation of “holds in the next state,” the answer could change; under the standard single-event-per-state temporal-next semantics used above, C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (i.e., event3 is true / has occurred initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, no other events can happen (so once event3 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 occurs afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event4, event2 must happen (if event4 occurs then event2 occurs afterwards).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (i.e., event3 is false / did not occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" i.e., (event3 does not happen) OR (event4 occurs).

(There is no C3 given in the hypothesis.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / evaluation?
- From the initial condition, event3 happened, so C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
- Because event3 happened and the rule ""after event3 no other events can happen"" holds, event4 cannot happen (no events can occur after event3). So event4 is false.
- Therefore C2 = (C1) OR (event4) = false OR false = false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened at the start (every execution begins with event3).

2) Transition rules
- After event1: next must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2: next must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event3: no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4: no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

(Notes: the context repeats the last two rules but they are the same.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreted naturally in this setting as: in every possible execution (every allowed run following the rules) event3 occurs (i.e., event3 is present in every trace).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is, there exists at least one allowed execution in which event3 does not occur.

4) How the conditions relate, and evaluation
- Because the initial condition states that event3 happened at the start, every allowed execution already contains event3 (it occurs immediately). Also, event3 is terminal, so no later events can remove that fact. Therefore C1 is true (event3 occurs in every execution).
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

Remark on interpretation: If by ""always happens"" one instead meant ""at every moment from now on event3 holds"" (a stronger reading), the story is still consistent: execution starts with event3 and then no further events occur, so there are no moments after the start with a different event — the usual, intended reading (event3 occurs in all executions) makes C1 true and C2 false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (interpreting “after X ...” as the next-state rule; one event per state)
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
- After event3, next must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event4, no further events can happen (event4 is terminal).

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” Formally, at a state s, C1 means at s+1 the event is event4.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Formally, at state s, C2 means at s+1 the formula C1 is true — i.e. at s+2 the event is event4 (a two-step lookahead).

4) How they relate and truth value
- From s0 we have event1. The rules force s1 = event2 (because after event1 event2 must happen). Then s2 = event1 (after event2 event1 must happen). So the system cycles: s0=1, s1=2, s2=1, s3=2, ... indefinitely.
- Event4 can only occur immediately after event3 (by the rules), but there is no rule that allows event3 to appear after event1 or event2, and starting from s0=1 the rules force the 1↔2 alternation. Thus event3 (and therefore event4) is unreachable on this run.
- Therefore C1 (that event4 happens in the next state) is false at s0, and C2 (that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. event4 happens two steps ahead) is also false.

- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.

- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean

- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” (the conjunction of C1 with “event1 happens”; effectively it requires event1 to occur — C1 already asserts that.)

4) How they relate and whether C2 is true
- From the rules there are two recurring choices after each 3: go to 1 or go to 4. Starting from event2 you must take either 1 or 4 next.
- One possible trace that includes event1: 2 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → … (event1 happens repeatedly). In this trace C1 (and therefore C2) is true.
- But there is also a valid trace that never contains event1: 2 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → … (always choose 4 after 3). In this trace event1 never occurs, so C1 is false and therefore C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 holds in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 -> next is event2).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (event2 -> next is event1 or event3).
- After event3, event4 must happen (event3 -> next is event4).
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen (event4 -> next is event1 or event3).

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (At some state s, C1 holds iff in s+1 event4 holds.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (There exists some future state where C1 is true — i.e., at some state the next state contains event4.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the rules, event4 occurs only immediately after event3. To get event3 you must, at some point, choose event3 as the successor of event2.
- But after event2 it is allowed to choose event1 instead, and then from event1 you must go to event2 again. So one possible infinite behavior is the cycle: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... This trace never visits event3 or event4, so C1 never holds at any state, hence C2 does not hold on that trace.
- There are other traces where you do choose event3 after some event2 (e.g. event1, event2, event3, event4 ...), in which case C1 and therefore C2 do hold. So C2 is satisfiable (true on some traces) but not guaranteed on all traces.

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true (it is not entailed by the rules). If you mean ""C2 holds on all possible executions"": False. If you mean ""there exists an execution where C2 holds"": True.

Counterexample: start at event1 (initial), then follow the permitted transitions event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... forever. This trace never visits event3 or event4, so C1 (event4 in the next state) never holds at any state, hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed."

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed (so it is not true as a logical consequence of the rules). It is only true in some runs and false in others.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (we are at the state right after event4).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event3 follows event2).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so event1 follows event3).
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — here interpreted as “event1 does not happen in the (current) next step” (the statement is about whether event1 occurs at some given step).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the current one (the state after the initial event4), event1 does not happen.

4) How the conditions relate / evaluation
- From the rule after event4, the next event must be either event1 or event2.
  - If the next event is event1, then C1 is false in that next state (event1 does happen), so C2 is false on that branch.
  - If the next event is event2, then C1 is true in that next state (event1 does not happen immediately), so C2 is true on that branch. (Note: after that branch event2 → event3 → event1 will still eventually force event1, but C2 only talks about the immediate next state.)
- Because the rules allow both possibilities, C2 is not entailed by the premises. It is contingent: true in some traces, false in others.

Conclusion: C2 is not universally true (not logically guaranteed). If you must answer True/False as “is C2 a guaranteed consequence?” — False. If you mean “could C2 be true in some run?” — Yes, in runs where event2 occurs next.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules (after X → next must be ...)
- After event1: either event2 or event4.
- After event2: event4.
- After event4: either event1 or event3. (This rule is given twice but is the same rule.)
- After event3: event1. (Also repeated.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" (We must choose a reading of ""always"".)
  Two common readings:
  a) Global/pointwise: at every time step the event that occurs is event4 (formally: G event4). That says event4 happens at every step.
  b) Repeatedly/inevitably: event4 occurs infinitely often (formally: G F event4 — “always eventually event4”).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Under the usual reading this just asserts that the property C1 is true at all times; in practice it reduces to the same type of global claim about event4 as C1 itself.

4) How the rules relate and final answer
- Under reading (a) (G event4): C1 is false. Right after the initial event4, the next event may be event1 or event3, so there are steps where event4 does not occur. Hence C1 is false and therefore C2 (which asserts C1 always holds) is also false.
- Under reading (b) (G F event4): C1 is true. Every run always returns to event4: from event4 you go to 1 or 3; 3 → 1; from 1 you go to 2 or 4; from 2 → 4. There is no infinite path that avoids returning to event4, so event4 recurs infinitely often. Thus C1 (event4 occurs infinitely often) holds, and so does C2 under that interpretation.

If you mean the usual literal reading ""event4 holds at every step,"" then C2 is False. If instead you meant ""event4 always recurs (infinitely often),"" then C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: Interpreting ""always happens"" as ""holds at every step"", after the initial event4 the next event can be event1 or event3, so event4 does not occur at every step; C1 is false and therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (we start in a state labeled event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (successors from a state where a given event happened)
- After event2: no other events can happen (no successors).
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen (successors: event2, event3).
- After event3: either event1, event2, or event4 must happen (successors: event1, event2, event4).
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen (successors: event2, event4).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" Interpreted straightforwardly: in every state along the execution (from now on) event4 holds (i.e., every state is an event4 state). Equivalently, event4 holds in the current state and every future state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the immediate successor state (the state after the current one), C1 is true (i.e., from that successor state onward event4 holds in every state).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial state (event2) there are no successors (the trace terminates immediately).
- Two important consequences:
  1. C1 is false at the initial state because the initial state is event2, not event4 (so event4 does not ""always"" hold).
  2. C2 asserts something about the immediate successor state. But there is no successor state. Under the usual semantics for ""next"" (X) on finite traces, ""X φ"" is false in a state with no successor. (If one used a different semantics that treats ""next"" as undefined, one would say C2 is undefined rather than true; under the standard convention it is false.)
- Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state is event2 and has no successor, so ""C1 in the next state"" (the standard X operator) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (the run starts with event3).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen next.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3} must happen next.
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event4, no other events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" Given the initial condition, C1 is false (event3 did happen).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (i.e., some run contains event2).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial event3, three continuations are allowed: go to event1, or event2, or event4.
  - If continuation is event1 (sequence e.g. [3,1]), event2 does not occur → C2 is false.
  - If continuation is event4 (sequence e.g. [3,4]), event2 does not occur → C2 is false.
  - If continuation is event2 (sequence e.g. [3,2,...]), event2 does occur → C2 is true.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules: it is true in some possible runs and false in others.

Final answer: C2 is undecided/not necessarily true (both true and false are possible depending on how the nondeterministic choices after event3 are resolved).

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed. From the initial event2, the next event must be event1 or event3, so C1 (event1 or event2) may hold in the next state if the next event is event1, but not if it is event3. Thus C2 is satisfiable but not valid (not necessarily true).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (current state = event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event4 → either event1 or event2.
- After event1 → event4.
- After event2 → either event1 or event3.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “event2 happens or event1 happens” — i.e., the current state's event is either event1 or event2.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the immediately following state, the event is event1 or event2.

4) How they relate / reasoning
- From the initial state event2, the rule “after event2” forces the next event to be either event1 or event3.
- If the next event is event1, then C1 holds in that next state, so C2 is true on that branch.
- If the next event is event3, then in that next state neither event1 nor event2 holds, so C1 is false there, and C2 is false on that branch.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed: it is true on some possible runs and false on others. (Formally: C2 is satisfiable but not valid.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen (i.e. the next event after event1 is 3 or 4).
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the statement; those repetitions are redundant.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at a given state, C1 asserts that the immediate next event/state is event1.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That means in every state of the system (or globally), the next state is event1.

4) How do these conditions relate, and evaluation:
- Start in the initial state where event1 has just happened.
- The rule ""after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen"" forbids event1 as the immediate next event. Therefore C1 is false in the initial state (the next event cannot be event1).
- Since C1 fails at the initial state, C1 is not true ""always"", so C2 is false.
- More generally, C2 cannot be true in this system because the transition rule from event1 prevents the next state from being event1, so there is at least one (indeed the initial) state where C1 fails. Thus C2 is impossible.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (so event1 occurs first).
- Additional global constraint: “After event1, no other events can happen.” So once event1 has happened (and it happens initially), no further events can occur afterward.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- Combine the last two: event4 ⇒ event3 ⇒ event1, so event4 ⇒ event1 (if event4 occurs then event1 must occur afterward).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “If event4 happens, then event1 happens.” This is the implication event4 ⇒ event1.
- C2: “Event4 happens and C1 holds.” This asserts both that event4 actually occurs and that the implication of C1 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- From the transition rules we can infer C1 is true (event4 forces event3, which forces event1).
- However, because event1 happened initially and “after event1 no other events can happen,” no further events (including event4) can occur at any later time. Therefore event4 does not (and cannot) happen in this scenario.
- C2 requires event4 to happen (and also C1 to hold). Although C1 holds, the conjunction is false because event4 does not happen.

Conclusion: C1 is true (entailed by the rules). C2 is false (because event4 cannot occur given the initial event1 and its “no further events” rule).

Short answer: C2 is False (it does not follow from the context).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: in the current state (call it state0) event3 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen in the next state.
- After event1, event4 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event3, event2 must happen in the next state.
(“After event3, event2 must happen.” was repeated; it is the same rule.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state” (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one).
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds” — i.e., in the next state both event2 and event4 occur (or, if interpreted temporally, event2 occurs in the next state and C1 is true).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the initial state0 where event3 happened, the rule “after event3, event2 must happen” forces event2 to occur in the immediate next state (call it state1). So event2 in state1 is entailed.
- Does event4 occur in state1 (C1)? There is no rule that forces event4 after event3. The rule about event4 only constrains what must follow after event4, not that event4 must follow event3. Therefore C1 is not entailed by the given facts and rules.
- If we assume the standard one-event-per-state model (exactly one event happens in each state), then state1 must be event2 (by the rule) so event4 cannot be the event in state1; hence C1 is false, and therefore C2 (event2 AND C1) is false.
- If instead one allows multiple events to occur simultaneously in a state, then event2 is required in state1 but event4 is not forbidden by the rules — so C1 could be true in some models but is not forced by the context. In that interpretation C2 is not entailed either (it may be true in some models and false in others).

Conclusion: Under the usual single-event-per-state reading, C1 is false and therefore C2 is false. Even under a looser concurrent-events reading, C2 is not entailed by the premises (so you cannot conclude C2 is true).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From event3 we must have event2 in the next state, but there is no rule forcing event4 then. So C1 (event4 next) is not entailed, and thus C2 (event2 and event4 next) is not entailed — false under the usual single-event-per-state reading, and not guaranteed even if concurrent events are allowed."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened.
- Additional key fact: after event4, no other events can happen (so the state after the initial event4 is terminal).

2) Transition rules
- After event4: no further events (terminal).
- After event1: next must be either event2 or event4.
- After event2: next must be either event1 or event4.
- After event3: next must be either event1 or event4.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" — in temporal logic: F(event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. F(C1) = F(F(event3)). Note that F(F(p)) is equivalent to F(p), so C2 is logically equivalent to C1 (both mean ""event3 happens at some future point"").

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because the initial (and only) state is ""event4 happened"" and that state is terminal (no further events can occur), event3 cannot occur now or at any future time. Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 is also false.

Thus C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (it is given that initially event3 occurs).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen next.

(These are nondeterministic rules: they allow choices when “either … or …” appears.)

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens."" This is equivalent to simply “event3 happens” (the conjunction is redundant). Given the initial condition, C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds."" This is equivalent to “event4 happens AND event3 happens.” So C2 holds exactly when event3 happened (which we know) and event4 happens at some point.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer about C2
- C1 is true because the initial event3 is given.
- Is event4 guaranteed to happen? No. From the transitions we can produce:
  - A sequence that reaches event4: event3 → event2 → event1 → event4 (so event4 can happen).
  - A sequence that avoids event4 forever: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 … (always choose the event2→event3 branch), so event4 never occurs.
- Therefore event4 is possible but not entailed by the rules. C2 requires event4 to occur; since event4 is not guaranteed, C2 is not necessarily true given the information. It is satisfiable (there exist runs where C2 is true) but not provable/guaranteed.

Short answer: C1 is true. C2 is not necessarily true (possible but not guaranteed), so you cannot conclude C2 as definitely True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the run starts at event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen. (stated twice but same rule)
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen. (stated twice but same rule)

(These are nondeterministic choices — at each step one of the listed next events occurs.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” Interpreted as event3 never occurs at any point in the run.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” Interpreted as: under the assumption that event3 never occurs, event2 must (eventually) occur in the run.

Step 4 — how they relate; decision about C2
- Start at event4. Under C1, event3 is forbidden, so the allowed successors of event4 are event1 or event2.
- If the nondeterministic choice picks event2 at that point, then event2 happens and C2 would hold for that run.
- However, nondeterminism also allows picking event1. From event1 the allowed successors are event2 or event4. Again, under C1 event3 is not allowed, so one can always pick event4 rather than event2. That yields a possible infinite run that never includes event2: 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, ...
- Because such a run (4,1,4,1,...) satisfies C1 (no event3) but never includes event2, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Conclusion
- C2 is False: C1 (no event3) does not force event2 to happen (a counterexample run is 4,1,4,1,...).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start at event4 and repeatedly choose event1 then event4, producing the run 4,1,4,1,4,... This run meets C1 (event3 never occurs) but never contains event2, so C2 does not hold."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.
- Additional constraint: after event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, the system has no further events).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens"" (there exists some future point where event4 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — i.e., event4 eventually happens AND event2 happens (at some time).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because event1 occurred initially and the rule forbids any further events after event1, no other events (including event2, event3, event4) can ever occur.
- Therefore C1 is false (event4 does not eventually happen).
- Consequently C2 is also false (it requires C1 true and event2 to occur; neither happens).

So C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False (not guaranteed).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at the current (initial) state S0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event4 must happen (so from event2 the next state must be event4).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" Interpreting ""next state"" relative to the current initial state S0, C1 asserts: at S1, event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreting this relative to S0, C2 asserts: at S1 it is true that C1 holds. That means: at S2 (two steps from S0) event3 occurs.

(So C1 refers to S1; C2 refers to S2.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From S0 (event2) the rule forces S1 = event4. Therefore C1 (event3 at S1) is false.
- From S1 = event4, the rule allows S2 to be either event2 or event3. Thus event3 at S2 is possible but not forced. C2 asserts that event3 must occur at S2; since S2 could instead be event2, C2 is not guaranteed.

Concrete counterexample trace showing C2 false:
S0: event2 -> S1: event4 -> S2: event2 (allowed). In this trace C2 is false because event3 does not occur at S2.

Conclusion: C2 is not true (it is not entailed by the rules). It is satisfiable (there exist traces where C2 holds) but not necessarily true in all allowed traces.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (In every allowed execution/run consistent with the rules, both event4 and event2 occur.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the rules, after event1 you must choose one of event2, event3, or event4.
  - If you choose event4 immediately: event4 happens and then no further events can occur, so event2 does not happen. This run violates C1.
  - If you choose event2 immediately: event2 happens and then no further events occur, so event4 does not happen. This run violates C1.
  - If you choose event3: then event2 must follow (so event2 happens) and then nothing else; event4 does not happen. This run also violates C1.
- There is no way to have both event4 and event2 occur in a single execution because both are terminal (after either one nothing else can happen), so C1 is impossible in any run.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must follow each event)
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2: event1 must happen next.
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1: event4 must happen next.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “If event3 happens, then event3 happens.” This is a tautology (A → A). It is always true.
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” This asserts both that event1 occurs at some point and that C1 is true. Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to simply asserting “event1 happens.”

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- From the transitions, some paths starting at event3 do lead to event1 (for example: 3 → 2 → 1 → 4 → ...). So event1 can happen.
- However, there is also a valid infinite path that never reaches event1: 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... . This path obeys all transition rules but avoids event2 and therefore never reaches event1.
- Because there exists a valid execution consistent with the rules in which event1 never occurs, “event1 happens” is not guaranteed.

Conclusion
- C1 is true (tautology).
- C2 (which requires event1 to happen) is not guaranteed; therefore C2 is not necessarily true. In other words, C2 is false as a necessary consequence of the given rules (it is satisfiable in some runs but not entailed in all runs).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition given: ""Initially, event4 happened."" Also given: ""After event4, no other events can happen."" So event4 occurs at the start and is terminal (no events can occur after it).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event4 happens."" (Both events occur.)
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" This is equivalent to ""Event3 happens and (Event3 happens and Event4 happens)"" — i.e., again: event3 and event4 both occur (C2 is just a redundant restatement of C1).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Because event4 happens initially and is terminal, no other events can occur after it. Interpreting ""initially"" as the start of the timeline, there are no earlier events either, so the only event that occurs in the timeline is event4.
- Therefore event3 does not happen. That makes C1 false (it requires event3). Since C2 simply asserts the same conjunction as C1, C2 is also false.

(If one tried to allow event3 before event4, that would force event1 (and then event2 or event3, and if event2 then event4), producing a sequence that ends in event4 — but that contradicts ""initially, event4 happened"" if ""initially"" is taken to mean event4 is at the start. Under the natural reading that event4 is the initial, terminal event, both C1 and C2 are false.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it S0), event4 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen. (This is stated twice; same rule.)
- After event4, event1 must happen.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" Interpreting from the initial state S0, C1 asserts that at S1 (the immediate next state) event4 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means at S1, C1 is true — i.e., from S1's perspective the next state (S2) has event4. Equivalently, C2 asserts event4 happens two steps from the initial state (at S2).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Start at S0: event4 happened. The rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" forces S1 to be event1. Therefore C1 (event4 at S1) is false.
- From S1 (event1), the rule forces S2 to be event3. Thus at S1, C1 (which would assert event4 at S2) is also false. Therefore C2 (C1 holds in the next state, i.e. event4 at S2) is false.
- More generally, once you leave the initial event4, the system cycles event1 ↔ event3 (1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ...). There is no rule that leads back to event4 except from event2, which never occurs here, so event4 does not reoccur.

Conclusion: C1 is false (event4 does not happen in the next state), and therefore C2 is also false.

Answer: C2 is False (not guaranteed). Below I show the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at the current (initial) state, event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: event2 must happen next.
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen next.
- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen next.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” (If we write X for “next”, C1 = X(event4).)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That is, in the next state C1 is true. In temporal notation C2 = X(C1) = X X(event4) — event4 occurs two steps from now.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial state (event3), the next state (time 1) must be either event2 or event4.
  - If the next state is event2, then the state after that (time 2) must be either event1 or event4 — so event4 may or may not occur at time 2.
  - If the next state is event4, then the state after that (time 2) must be either event1 or event3 — in either case event4 does NOT occur at time 2.

A counterexample showing C2 is false:
- t0: event3 (given).
- Choose t1: event4 (allowed because after event3 we can have event4).
- Then t2: choose event1 (allowed because after event4 we can have event1).
- At t2 there is no event4, so C1 is false at t1, hence C2 (which says C1 holds at t1) is false in this run.

Because there is a valid run consistent with the rules where C2 is false, C2 is not guaranteed true. (C2 is therefore False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: t0 = event3. Let t1 = event4 (allowed after event3). Then t2 = event1 (allowed after event4). At t1, C1 (event4 at t2) is false, so C2 (C1 at t1) is false."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happened first.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event4 → next is either event1 or event3.
- After event1 → next is either event2 or event3.
- After event3 → next is either event1 or event4.
- After event2 → next is either event1 or event3.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting ""always happens"" in the usual sense used here: event3 must occur on every possible execution (or at every state of an execution, which is even stronger). Either reasonable interpretation requires that no execution can avoid event3.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That means C1 is true in all cases (essentially restating that event3 is unavoidable).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the rules, starting at event2 we may choose the transition event2 → event1 (this is allowed). From event1 we may choose event1 → event2 (also allowed). Repeating these choices yields the infinite trace:
  2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, ...
  This trace never contains event3, so event3 is not unavoidable.
- Therefore C1 is false (there exists a valid execution with no event3). Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: starting from event2 you can repeatedly take event2 → event1 → event2 → ... which never visits event3, so C1 (“event3 always happens”) is false; hence C2 is false."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened (so at least one occurrence of event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event4 → either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2 → either event3 or event4 must happen. (This rule is repeated but is the same rule.)
- After event3 → event2 must happen. (Also repeated; same rule.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens."" This is a simple disjunction about whether either event1 or event4 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when neither event1 nor event4 happens.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- The initial condition already states that event1 happened. Therefore the disjunction in C1 (event1 or event4) is true.
- Since C1 is true, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.

So C2 is false.

- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (it is given that initially event4 occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- (The last rule is repeated; it’s redundant.)

Step 3 — meanings of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens."" Interpreted as: at least one of event1 or event4 occurs in the timeline.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the logical negation of C1 — equivalently: neither event1 nor event4 happens.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because the initial condition already says event4 happened, C1 is true (event4 did happen).
- Therefore C2, being the negation of C1, is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (""event1 or event4 happens"") is true because event4 already happened initially, so its negation C2 is false."

Reason: Initially event2 occurs, so by ""after event2, event4 must happen"" an event4 must occur later. But ""after event4, event2 must happen"", so a further event2 is required after that event4.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened at the start (so every possible run/trace begins with event3).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur next (event3 -> event1).
- After event1 occurs, one of event2, event3, or event4 must occur next (event1 -> {event2, event3, event4}).
- After event2, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).
- After event4, no further events can occur (event4 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Given the usual reading in this context, this means in every possible run of the system event3 occurs (at least once).
  - Because event3 happened initially, every run already contains an occurrence of event3, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" This is a logical disjunction: C2 is true if either C1 is true or there is a run in which event4 happens (or both).

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts at event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next (a nondeterministic choice).
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, no further events can happen (event4 is terminal).
(There is no rule that leads to event4 from the initial state, so event4 is unreachable here.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: along a given execution starting from the initial state, at some future point event3 occurs (formal: F event3).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Two plausible readings:
  a) Universal reading: For every possible execution starting from the initial state, C1 holds (i.e., in all runs event3 eventually occurs).
  b) Stronger/temporal reading: In every state along a run, C1 holds from that state on (i.e., G F event3, meaning event3 will keep occurring infinitely often).
  Either reading amounts to an inevitability or persistence of event3.

4) How do these conditions relate, and final verdict?
- From the initial event1 there are two possible immediate behaviors:
  A) Choose event3 after event1 → sequence: event1, event3 (terminal). C1 holds on this run.
  B) Choose event2 after event1 → sequence: event1, event2, event1, ... and each time after event1 you may again choose event2. This allows an infinite loop event1 ↔ event2 that never reaches event3, so C1 fails on that run.
- Because there exists at least one valid execution that never reaches event3, C1 is not guaranteed on all executions. Therefore C2 (under the natural universal reading ""in all executions C1 holds"") is False.
- The stronger temporal reading (G F event3) is also false: you can avoid event3 forever by repeatedly choosing event2 after event1.

Note: If you add a fairness assumption that forbids indefinitely postponing the choice of event3 (for example, if the choice must eventually pick event3), then C2 could become true under that fairness. With the rules as stated and no fairness assumption, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event1 there is a valid run that repeatedly chooses event2 (event1 → event2 → event1 → ...), never taking the branch to event3. Thus event3 does not eventually happen on all executions, so C2 (that C1 holds in every execution) is false. (With a fairness assumption preventing indefinite postponement of the event3 branch, C2 could be true, but no such assumption was given.)"

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the run starts right after event4).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event4: one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen next.
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1: no further events can happen (terminal).
- After event3: no further events can happen (terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting this as: in every possible execution (starting from the initial state), event3 occurs at some point.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting this as: C1 is true for the system (i.e., it is always the case that event3 occurs in every execution). In practice C2 asserts the same global property as C1 (that event3 occurs on every possible run).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value?
- From the transitions, possible runs starting from event4 include:
  - event4 → event1 (allowed because after event4 you may choose event1). Here event3 does NOT occur.
  - event4 → event3 (event3 occurs).
  - event4 → event2 → event1 (no event3).
  - event4 → event2 → event3 (event3 occurs).
- Because there exists at least one valid run (e.g. event4 → event1) in which event3 does not occur, C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, the claim C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial state: event3 happened (call this state s0).

2) Transition rules (from any state where the named event has just happened)
- after event1: next must be event3 or event4.
- after event3: next must be event2.
- after event4: next must be event1 or event2 or event3.
- after event2: next must be event1. (This rule was listed twice; it's the same constraint.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting “always” in the usual temporal sense (G event2) means: at the current state and at every future state, event2 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In temporal notation, C2 = X C1: in the immediate successor state, C1 is true (i.e., from that successor state onward, event2 holds at every state).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From s0 (event3), the rules force the next state s1 to be event2 (because after event3, event2 must happen).
- At s1 we have event2. But after event2, the next state s2 must be event1. So s2 is event1, not event2.
- Therefore C1 (which requires that every state from the current one onward has event2) is false at s1 (because s2 ≠ event2).
- Since C1 is false at the next state, C2 = X C1 is false at the initial state.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: at time 0 event3 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (as a directed graph)
- From event3: next must be event2 or event4. (3 → {2,4})
- From event2: next must be event1 or event4. (2 → {1,4})
- From event4: next must be event1. (4 → {1})
- From event1: next must be event2 or event3 or event4. (1 → {2,3,4})

(Notes: the repeated sentences in the problem restate the same rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting ""always"" in the standard temporal (safety) sense: C1 = “for every time step, the current event is event2” (globally/eventually-for-all-time).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” That is, there exists some time t0 after which C1 is true at every subsequent time — equivalently, eventually from some point on every state is event2 (eventually always event2).

Step 4 — how the rules affect C1 and C2
- From the transition rules, whenever you are in event2 the next event must be event1 or event4. There is no transition 2 → 2. Hence it is impossible to have two consecutive time steps both be event2.
- Therefore it is impossible for C1 to hold at any time (you cannot have “every future state is event2”).
- Consequently, C2 (""eventually C1"") is also impossible: there is no time after which all future steps are event2.

Conclusion
- C1 is False.
- C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From event2 the next state must be event1 or event4 (no 2 → 2). So you cannot reach a point after which every future state is event2. Hence ""event2 always holds"" can never eventually become true."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.
- Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs, the execution stops and no further events occur.

2) Transition rules
- After event1: no next events.
- After event2: next must be either event1 or event4.
- After event4: next must be event3.
- After event3: next must be either event1 or event2.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens"" (both occur).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all possible executions/paths, both event3 and event2 occur.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Because the system starts with event1 and after event1 no further events can occur, the actual execution is just event1 with no event2 or event3 ever happening.
- Thus C1 is false in the given system (neither event2 nor event3 occurs).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

(If the initial condition were different, some traces might contain both event2 and event3, but with the given initial event1 + blocking rule, C2 is false.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initially: event1 happened (so we are at a state where the current event is event1).

2) Transition rules (reading ""After X, Y must happen"" as: whenever X happens, the next state’s event is forced)
- After event4 → event3 must happen next.
- After event3 → event4 must happen next.
- After event1 → either event3 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2 → event3 must happen next.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Applied to the current/initial state, this asserts that the immediate next event is event2.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: at all times (for the initial state and for every reachable state), the immediate next event is event2.

4) How the conditions relate and final reasoning
- From the initial event1, the rules force the next event to be either event3 or event4 (not event2).
- If event3 occurs next, the rule forces the following event to be event4; if event4 occurs next, it forces the following to be event3. So once we leave event1, the system alternates 3 ↔ 4 indefinitely.
- Nowhere in the rules is event2 produced as a next event from any of the reachable events (1,3,4), so event2 cannot be the next event after the initial state (and in fact never occurs at all in any reachable state).

Therefore C1 (event2 happens in the next state from the initial state) is false, and C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (the current state is event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event1: the next state must be event2 or event3.
- After event2: the next state must be event3 or event4.
- After event3: the next state must be event4.
- After event4: the next state must be event1 or event3.
(Notes: some rules are repeated in the text but they state the same constraints.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” Interpreting relative to the initial state, C1 asserts that the state immediately following the initial event1 is event4.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” This means in every reachable state (or at least in the initial state and in all states generally), the next state is event4 — equivalently, C1 is true in all states.

Step 4 — how they relate / evaluation
- From the rule for event1, the next state after the initial event1 must be event2 or event3. Therefore the next state cannot be event4. So C1 (event4 happens in the next state from the initial state) is false.
- Because C1 is already false in the initial situation, the claim that C1 always holds (C2) is also false.

Counterexample trace (consistent with the rules) showing failure of C1/C2:
- Start: event1 (initial).
- Next: choose event2 (allowed by “after event1 → event2 or event3”).
  => The next state is event2, not event4, so C1 fails right away.

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: the initial state is event1 (initially event1 happened).

2) Transition rules
- From event2 → either event1 or event4.
- From event1 → either event2 or event3.
- From event4 → either event1 or event2.
- From event3 → event4 (must happen).
These are nondeterministic choices unless a single option is forced.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" I read this as: at every state along the execution, the current event is event3 (i.e., event3 holds at all times).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the immediate successor state(s) after the initial state, C1 is true (i.e., starting from that next state, event3 holds at every time).

4) How the conditions relate and truth values
- C1 is false. Reason: from the initial event1 you can choose the successor event2 (since event1 → event2 or event3). Then from event2 you can choose event1, and so on. Example run: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... never visits event3. So it is not true that event3 holds at every state.
- C2 is also false. To make C2 true you would need every immediate successor of the initial state to satisfy C1. The initial state (event1) has two possible successors: event2 and event3. The successor event2 does not satisfy C1 (from event2 you can avoid event3 forever as shown). Also even if the next state were event3, C1 would still fail (from event3 you must go to event4, so event3 cannot hold at every subsequent state). Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state(s). So C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial state (event1) one successor is event2, and from event2 you can loop event2→event1→event2... avoiding event3 forever, so C1 (""event3 always happens"") fails in that successor. (Also the other successor event3 immediately goes to event4, so C1 fails there too.) Hence C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at time 0 (the run starts at event2).

2) Transition rules (allowed next events)
- After event2: next ∈ {event1, event4}.
- After event1: next ∈ {event2, event4}.
- After event4: next = event2.
- After event3: next ∈ {event1, event4}.

(One of the ""After event4"" lines is duplicated; they are the same rule.)

Note: From the given rules, event3 is not reachable from event2 (no rule leads to event3), so reachable states from the start are event1, event2, event4.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" — interpreted as: from the current time onward, at every time step event4 holds (temporal form: G event4).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — interpreted as: at some future time N, from that time onward event4 holds at every step (temporal form: F G event4). Equivalently, there is a suffix of the run consisting entirely of event4.

4) Relation and conclusion
- Because after any event4 the next event must be event2, two consecutive event4 occurrences are impossible. Thus no suffix of a run can consist solely of event4.
- Therefore C1 (G event4) is false in every moment of every run, and there is no future time after which only event4 occurs.
- Hence C2 (F G event4) is false.

Concrete counterexamples of valid runs starting from the initial event2:
- 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, ... (always choosing 4 after 2) — event4 does not hold at all times (event2 appears repeatedly).
- 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ... (always choosing 1 after 2) — event4 never holds.

Thus C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

2) Transition rules

- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event4 → event3 must happen. (This is repeated but equivalent.)

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ¬(event4 ∨ event3), equivalently (¬event4 ∧ ¬event3).

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- The initial condition states event3 has already happened, so event3 is true.
- Therefore the disjunction event4 ∨ event3 (C1) is true.
- Since C1 is true, its negation C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the trace starts at event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
(Repeated sentences in the problem are the same rules restated.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There exists some future point in the trace where event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That is, at some future point C1 is true (there is a later point from which event2 will eventually happen). In linear-time logic, ""eventually (eventually event2)"" is equivalent to ""eventually event2"", so C2 is equivalent to C1.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true?
- From the rules and the initial event1, a possible infinite trace is:
  event1 → event4 → event3 → event1 → event4 → event3 → ...
  At every visit to event4 the choice ""event3"" is taken; event2 is never chosen. This trace respects all the given rules but never contains event2.
- Because such a valid trace exists where event2 never happens, C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed (it is false as a must/hard assertion). Since C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (there is a valid run consistent with the rules in which event2 never occurs).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 is ""eventually (eventually event2)"", which is equivalent to ""eventually event2"". The trace event1 → event4 → event3 → event1 → event4 → event3 → ... respects all rules and never contains event2, so event2 is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is false."

Reason: From the initial event1 the next event can be event2 or event3. If event2 occurs, event4 must follow; but if event3 occurs you can loop event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> event1 ... forever (from event3 you may choose event1, and from event1 you may choose event3), never taking the branch to event2 and thus never reaching event4. So ""event4 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed from the next state (it fails on the branch starting with event3), hence C2 is False."

Short answer: C2 is True (given the usual reading that ""C1: Event2 always happens"" means ""event2 necessarily occurs / will occur in every allowed run"").

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (in every run we consider).

2) Transition rules (implications)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → eventually event1)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → eventually event2)
- After event3, event4 must happen. (event3 → eventually event4)
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen. (event4 → eventually (event2 ∨ event3))

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every admissible execution (given the initial condition and rules) event2 will occur (i.e., event2 is inevitable / guaranteed). (If you meant a stronger reading like ""event2 holds at every time instant,"" that is different — I assume the usual temporal reading of inevitability.)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" I.e., whenever event1 occurs, that implies event2 is (inevitably) going to happen (so C1 is true).

4) How the conditions relate
- From the rule event1 → eventually event2, any execution that contains event1 must contain event2 afterward. Since event1 is given as having happened initially, event2 must therefore occur in every allowed execution. Thus C1 is true (event2 is inevitable).
- C2 says: if event1 happens then C1 holds. Because event1 does happen (initially) and that entails event2 will occur (by the rule), the implication in C2 is satisfied. More generally, whenever event1 happens at any point, the rule guarantees event2 will follow, so C1 (inevitability of event2) holds in that execution.

Conclusion: Under the standard interpretation of the rules and of ""always happens"" as inevitability, C2 is True.

Caveat: if by C1 you meant ""event2 holds at every moment (globally true at all times)"" then C1 would be false (we only get event2 at some moments, not at all times), and then C2 would be false under that reading.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the initial condition says event1 occurs in every run, and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" makes event2 inevitable in every run, so C1 holds. C2 (""if event1 happens then C1"") is therefore true. (If by ""always happens"" you instead meant ""holds at every moment"" rather than ""inevitably occurs,"" the answer would differ.)"

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event2 happens first.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (2 → 1).
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen (1 → {2,3,4}).
- After event3, event2 must happen (3 → 2).
- After event4, one of event1 or event2 must happen (4 → {1,2}).

(“Either” / “one of” is nondeterministic: if a rule gives multiple options, any of them is a permitted next event.)

3) Meaning of conditions
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” (This is a property of a particular execution/trace: it says that trace contains no occurrence of event3.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (This asserts that in every possible allowed execution/trace, event3 never occurs — i.e., event3 is impossible in all runs.)

4) Relation and conclusion
- From the rules, starting at the initial event2 we have 2 → 1. From event1 we are allowed to choose event3 (because 1 → {2,3,4}). Thus there exists a valid sequence 2 → 1 → 3 (and then 3 → 2 → 1 → …).
- Therefore event3 can occur in some allowed runs. That means C1 (“event3 does not happen”) is not true in all runs, so C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4.
- Initial condition: event3 happens (it has already occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event4} must happen. (This rule was given twice.)
- After event3, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens."" Since event3 is given to have happened initially, C1 is equivalent to saying ""event2 happens (at some point)"" together with the known event3.
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" Logically C2 = event3 ∧ (event3 ∧ event2) = event3 ∧ event2 — i.e. C2 is equivalent to C1. So C2 holds exactly when event2 happens (because event3 is already true).

Step 4 — how the rules relate to these conditions and final answer
- Starting from the initial event3, the rules force event4 next (event3 → event4).
- After that event4 may be followed by event1, event2, or event3:
  - If after event4 we pick event2, then event2 happens and C1/C2 are true.
  - If after event4 we pick event1, then event1 forces event2 next, so again event2 happens and C1/C2 are true.
  - If after event4 we pick event3, then event3 forces event4 again, and we can loop 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 ... indefinitely and never choose event1 or event2. In that execution, event2 never happens, so C1/C2 are false.
- Therefore: C2 is satisfiable (there are executions where it is true) but it is not entailed by the rules (not guaranteed true in every possible execution).

Short answer: C2 is not necessarily true. It can be true in some sequences of events and false in others.
