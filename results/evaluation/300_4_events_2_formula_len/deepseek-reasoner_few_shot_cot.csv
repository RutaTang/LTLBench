Interpreting ""always happens"" in temporal logic, it means that event4 must be true in every state of the sequence. However, from the transitions, after event4, event3 must happen, so event4 cannot be true in consecutive states. Therefore, it is impossible for event4 to be true in every state. Thus, C1 is false.

Since C1 is false, C2 (which asserts that C1 does not hold) is true.

Additionally, considering possible sequences from the initial state event3, we must go to event1. From event1, we can go to event2, event3, or event4. If we go to event3 from event1, we return to event1, creating a loop where event4 never occurs. Similarly, a loop between event1 and event2 can avoid event4 entirely. Thus, there are sequences where event4 does not occur, further confirming that C1 is false.

From the initial state (event2), the transitions allow for a sequence where event2 always happens: specifically, from event2, we can go to event4, and from event4, we can go back to event2. This cycle (event2 → event4 → event2 → ...) can continue indefinitely, meaning event2 is always true in this sequence. Therefore, in this sequence, C1 never holds.

Since there exists at least one sequence where C1 never holds, C2 is false.

From the initial state where event2 happened, the possible sequences always lead to event1 eventually:
- If from event2, it goes directly to event1, then event1 happens.
- If from event2, it goes to event3, then from event3 it must go to event4, and from event4 it must go to event1.

Initially, event1 happened. From event1, the system must transition to either event2 or event4:
- If it transitions to event2, then after event2, no other events can happen. Thus, the system remains at event2, where event1 does not happen, so C1 holds.

Event3 is not reachable from the initial state or from any transitions from event1 or event4, so it never occurs. Therefore, in all possible sequences, the system eventually reaches event2 and remains there, meaning event1 does not happen eventually.

From the initial state, event2 happened. After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen. If event4 happens, then in that state, event4 is true, so C1 holds (because event4 happens). However, in that state, event2 does not happen (since only one event occurs at a time). Therefore, when C1 holds due to event4, event2 does not hold, violating C2.

Even though in sequences where event4 never occurs, C2 may hold in those states, the possibility of reaching event4 means that there exists a state where C1 holds but event2 does not. Thus, C2 is not true in all cases.

Therefore, C2 is false.

From the initial state, event4 happened. The transitions are:
- After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.

In all possible sequences, event3 cannot happen in every state because after event3, event4 must occur. For example:
- If the sequence goes from event4 to event3, then to event4, and so on, event4 occurs periodically.
- If the sequence goes from event4 to event1 or event2, then to event3, and then to event4, event4 still occurs.

Initially, event4 occurred. From event4, the transitions allow either event2 or event3 to happen. If event2 occurs, then C1 holds immediately because event2 is true.

In the system, events occur sequentially, meaning only one event is true at any given state. Therefore, if event1 happens, it implies that event2 is not happening at the same state.

However, from the transitions, after event3, the next event must be event1, event2, or event4, so event3 cannot occur consecutively. Therefore, event3 cannot always happen from any state, making C1 always false.

C2 states that ""C1 holds in the next state,"" meaning that in the immediate next state, C1 is true. Since C1 is always false, C2 is also always false. Specifically, from the initial state where event4 happened, the next state will have event1, event2, or event3, but from that state, event3 cannot always happen, so C1 is false in the next state, making C2 false.

Thus, C2 is False.

- Initially, event3 occurred.
- From event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2.
- If event1 occurs, no other events can happen, so the sequence stabilizes at event1. In this case, event4 never occurs.
- If event2 occurs, the next event must be event3, leading to a cycle between event2 and event3. In this cycle, event4 never occurs.
- There is no transition from any event to event4 in the available paths from the initial state. Therefore, event4 never happens in any sequence starting from event3.

Since event4 never happens, C1 (event4 always happens) is false. Thus, C2 requires both event2 to happen and C1 to hold, but since C1 is false, C2 is false regardless of whether event2 happens.

- The initial state is event4.
- From event4, event1 must happen, and after event1, no other events can happen. Thus, the sequence always goes from event4 to event1 and then remains at event1 forever.
- Event2 never occurs in this sequence because there is no transition to event2 from any event (event1, event3, or event4). Specifically:
  - After event1, no events occur.

- Initially, event1 happened, so C1 holds because event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So the next state is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so the system remains in event2.

There are no other sequences from the initial state that reach event3 or event4, as the only path from event1 is to event2, and then the system stops. Thus, C2 is false.

C2 is defined as ""C1 holds in the next state,"" meaning that in the next state from the current state, C1 is true. C1 is ""Event4 happens in the next state,"" meaning that in the state after the next state, event4 occurs.

From the initial state (event1), the next state must be event2 (since after event1, event2 must happen). At this next state (event2), C1 would require that in the following state, event4 happens. However, after event2, event1 must happen, so event4 does not occur in the following state. Therefore, C1 does not hold in the next state from the initial state, meaning C2 is false.

Additionally, the system cycles between event1 and event2 indefinitely, never reaching event4, so C2 cannot be true at any point from the initial state.

Thus, C2 is False.

The initial state is event1. From event1, the next event must be either event3 or event4, as per the transition ""After event1, either event3, or event4 must happen."" Therefore, event2 does not happen in the next state from event1.

From event3, the next event must be event4, as per ""After event3, event4 must happen."" Thus, event2 does not happen in the next state from event3.

- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen, so the sequence stabilizes at event3.

Thus, after event4, it is impossible to have event4 immediately again; instead, event1 or event3 must occur. If event3 occurs, the sequence stops at event3, and event4 never happens again. If event1 occurs, it may lead to event4 again, but event4 does not occur in every state because event1 or event3 intervenes. Therefore, in no sequence does event4 happen in every state from any point onward.

Since C1 never holds, C2 cannot be true.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.

Since after event1, event3 is a possible next event, there exists a sequence where event3 occurs. For example: event2 → event1 → event3.

In this sequence, event3 happens, so C1 is false at that state. Therefore, C1 does not always hold in all possible sequences, meaning C2 is false.

Thus, C2 is False.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context, events occur one at a time in discrete states. C2 requires both event3 and event2 to happen simultaneously, as C1 is defined as ""Event3 happens and event2 happens."" However, in any single state, only one event can be true. Therefore, it is impossible for event3 and event2 to be true at the same time, making C2 always false.

The event sequences from the initial state (event3) confirm that event3 and event2 never occur simultaneously. Thus, C2 is false.

Answer: False"
