C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" So C2 asserts: whenever event3 occurs, either event1 or event2 occurs.

Step 2 — Use the given rules:
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — Chain the implications:
If event3 happens, then either
- event2 happens (directly), which makes C1 true, or
- event4 happens, and then event2 must happen afterward — which also makes C1 true.

Thus in every possible case after event3, event2 will occur, so C1 holds.

- After event1, event4 must happen. (Explicitly forces event4 to occur after the initial event1.)
- Other rules (after event2 → event3, after event3 → either event2 or event4, after event4 → either event2 or event3) do not prevent event4 from occurring; they only constrain what can follow other events.

Step 3 — Reasoning about sequences:
- Because event1 initially happened and ""after event1, event4 must happen"", event4 will occur regardless of whether C1 holds.
- Therefore, even under the assumption that event2 always happens (C1), event4 still occurs (indeed it already must occur by the given rule).

Conclusion:
- The implication in C2 is true (event4 happens whenever C1 holds, and in fact event4 is guaranteed regardless).

- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") would require that whenever C1 is true, event2 must occur. But in the actual sequence C1 is true while event2 does not occur (we only have event3 then event4). That is a counterexample to C2.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""

- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal)
- After event2, next must be event1 or event3.
- After event3, next must be event1 or event4.
- After event4, next must be event2 or event3.

Step 3 — consequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and event1 is terminal, no further events can ever occur in any admissible execution. Therefore event2 never eventually happens, so C1 is false in every model allowed by the context.

Step 4 — truth of C2:
- C2 is an implication ""if C1 then event4"". An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since there are no models where C1 holds, the implication is true in all admissible models.

- The context also states: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means no future events can undo or change the fact that event2 has occurred; there are no alternate continuations that would avoid event2 having happened.
- Because every possible execution consistent with the constraints starts with event2 and then stops, C1 holds in all states/traces.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- C1 says event4 always happens. Start state: event1 has happened.
- From event1 the rules allow either event2 or event4 next.
- From event4 the rules force event1 next (the duplicate rule doesn't change anything).
- Therefore a valid infinite trace is: event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ... . This trace satisfies C1 (event4 occurs repeatedly) but never contains event3.
- Since there is a valid execution where C1 holds and event3 does not occur, ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Thus C2 is False."

- After event3, event4 must happen → event4 will occur at some point after the initial state.
- After event4, event1 must happen → once event4 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards.
- After event1 no other events can happen → event1 is terminal.

Possible interleavings (e.g. inserting event2) cannot prevent event4 occurring after event3, because if event2 led to event1 before event4 that would violate the requirement that event4 must happen after event3. Thus every allowed run must reach event4 and then event1, so event1 inevitably happens.

Step 3 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 is true (event1 eventually happens).
- C2 says ""eventually C1 holds."" That is equivalent here to C1 (if event1 inevitably happens, C1 already holds, so it certainly holds at some future point). Therefore C2 is also true.

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some point in time it becomes true that event2 does not happen (in fact C1 already holding at the start counts).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
(The other rules — after event1 no other events, after event2 event1 must happen, after event4 no other events — are irrelevant if no events can occur after event3.)

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- Because event3 has happened initially and after event3 no other events can happen, no occurrence of event2 is possible now or in the future.

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every step in the sequence).
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

2. Examine the constraints:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
   - Thus, immediately after any occurrence of event1 the system forces a next event that is not event1.

3. Consequence for C1:
   - C1 requires event1 at every step. That contradicts the rule ""after event1 → one of {2,3,4}"" because that rule forbids event1 from following event1.
   - Therefore C1 cannot hold in any sequence that obeys the given rules (C1 is impossible / inconsistent with the context).

4. Evaluate C2:
   - An implication ""If C1 then P"" is true whenever C1 is impossible (there are no models where C1 holds), so the implication is vacuously true.
   - Hence C2 is true given the context.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the conditional “if event1 happens then event2 does not happen.”

Examine the rules and trace possible sequences from the initial condition:

- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur immediately after the initial event4. So event3 occurs in every possible continuation (there is no alternative).
- After that (event3) either event1 or event2 must happen:
  - If event1 happens next, ""after event1, no other events can happen"" — the sequence ends, but event3 already occurred.
  - If event2 happens next, then ""after event2, either event1 or event4 must happen"":
    - If event1 follows, the sequence ends, and event3 already occurred.
    - If event4 follows, the rule ""after event4, event3 must happen"" forces event3 again, and the process repeats. In every branch, event3 appears.

Therefore event3 occurs in every possible sequence from the initial state: C1 is true. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context the allowed transitions are: 1 -> {2,3,4}, 2 -> {3}, 3 -> {1,4}, 4 -> {1,2,3}, with initial event4.
- Interpret C1 as the claim ""whenever event3 happens, event2 will happen (at some later time).""
- Produce a counterexample run: start at the initial 4, choose 4 -> 3, then always choose 3 -> 1 and 1 -> 3. That yields the infinite sequence 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, ... in which event3 occurs repeatedly but event2 never occurs.

- C2 = ""Event4 happens or C1 holds."" We must decide whether that disjunction is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Step 2 — restate the relevant conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- (Other rules: after event4 → one of {event1,event2,event3}; after event3 → one of {event1,event2,event4}; after event1 → no further events.)

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Since event2 has happened initially and ""after event2, event4 must happen"", event4 will occur in any sequence that satisfies the conditions.
- Therefore the disjunction ""event4 happens or C1 holds"" is satisfied by the fact that event4 happens. (Whether C1 itself holds is irrelevant for the truth of the disjunction.)

Reasoning:
- C1 says “event1 eventually happens.”
- From the initial state event2, the next event must be one of event1, event3, or event4.
  - If event1 is chosen, event1 has happened.
  - If event3 is chosen, it must be followed by event4, and after event4 event1 must happen → event1 occurs.
  - If event4 is chosen, after event4 event1 must happen → event1 occurs.
- Therefore, in every possible continuation from the initial event2, event1 occurs (within at most two steps). So C1 is true.
- C2 says “C1 eventually holds.” Since C1 already holds from the initial state, C2 is also true. (Also note F F p ≡ F p, so “eventually (eventually event1)” is equivalent to “eventually event1.”)"

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event3 never occurs.
- From the context: initially event4 happens. After event4, event1 is allowed. After event1, event3 is allowed. After event3, event4 must happen (so the trace can continue).
- A valid trace is: 4 (initial) → 1 → 3 → 4 → ...
  This trace contains event1 and also contains event3, so C1 is false in that trace.

- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen. Choose event1 (this choice is allowed).
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen. Choose event3 (this choice is allowed).
- Thus there is a valid sequence 2 → 1 → 3 in which event3 does happen.

Therefore C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false (there exists a valid run where 3 occurs). C2 states ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen (initially) but C1 is false, the implication in C2 is false. Hence C2 is False."

   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens.""  
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every point in every execution, either event1 or event4 occurs).

2. Given conditions:  
   - Initially, event1 happened.  
   - After event1, no other events can happen.  
   - (Other rules: after event4 → event1 must happen; after event2 → one of {event1,event3,event4}; after event3 → one of {event1,event2,event4}.)

3. Consequences:  
   - Since event1 occurs initially and no events can follow event1, every execution consists of that initial event1 only.  
   - Therefore at the only point in every execution (the initial point) C1 holds (because event1 happened). There are no later points where C1 could fail.

4. Conclusion: C1 holds at all times in every execution, so C2 is True."

- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event3 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. eventually Event3 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" That means Event3 has already occurred at the start.
- No given rule prevents Event3 from holding; the other rules only constrain what can follow after events 2, 3, 4, and 1.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Since Event3 already happened initially, C1 is true immediately.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially (at the current state) event3 has happened.
- Whenever event3 happens, eventually event4 must happen.
- Whenever event4 happens, eventually event1 must happen.
- (Other rules: after event2 → event3, and after event1 → event4; these only add obligations.)

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event3 has happened initially, there is an obligation that event4 will occur at some future point.
- When that event4 occurs, it creates an obligation that event1 will occur at some later point.
- Therefore from the initial state, event1 is guaranteed to occur eventually (C1 is true).
- Moving to the next state does not remove the outstanding obligations created by the initial event3. From the next state there is still the guaranteed future occurrence of event4 (and then event1). Thus in the next state it remains true that event1 will eventually happen.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Identify the hypothesis:
  - C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
  - C2 = ""C1 always holds"" means ""Event1 always holds"" (i.e., in every reachable situation/point in time).

- Examine the conditions:
  - Initially, event1 happened. So event1 occurs at the start.
  - After event1, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has occurred, the system cannot move to any further event.
  - The other rules (after event4 → event1, after event2 → event3 or event4, after event3 → event1 or event2 or event4) only matter if those events can occur, but they cannot because nothing can happen after the initial event1.

- Trace of possible event sequences:
  - The only possible sequence is: event1 (initial) and then nothing else. No alternative sequence is reachable.

- Conclusion:
  - Since event1 occurs in the only reachable sequence and there are no later states where it could fail, C1 holds in all reachable situations. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True."

Step 2 — read the conditions and possible sequences:
- Initially event1 happened (so at time 0 event1 occurs).
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- If event2 happens, no further events can happen (sequence stops).
- If event4 happens, then event2 must happen after that, and then no further events.
- (After event3, event2 must happen, but event3 never appears in any allowed continuation here.)

Step 3 — trace the allowed sequences:
- Sequence A: event1 → event2 (then stop).

In both sequences, at the step(s) after the initial one, the occurring event is event2 or event4 — i.e., a step exists where event1 does not happen.

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point from now on we reach a situation where Event1 does not occur (and stays not occurring).

Step 2 — understand the rules (transition graph)
- Start: event3 happened.
- After event3 → event2 must happen. So sequence begins 3 → 2.
- After event2 → next is either 1, 3, or 4.
- After event3 → next must be 2 (given).
- After event1 → next is 2 or 3.
- After event4 → next is 1, 2, or 3.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the required 3 → 2, at event2 we can choose 3 (allowed) instead of 1.
- If we choose 2 → 3, then from 3 we must go to 2 again. So we can repeat 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 … forever.
- In that infinite 2–3 cycle, Event1 never occurs. Thus the property ""Event1 does not happen"" holds (indeed, holds from the start of the cycle and forever after).

Conclusion
- Therefore C1 can be made true and indeed holds eventually (in fact immediately after the first 2 if we choose the 2↔3 cycle). So C2 is True.

(If one instead reads C2 as ""on every possible future path, eventually Event1 never occurs"", that stronger universal reading would be False — but under the standard existential reading of ""eventually"" (there exists a future run where C1 holds), C2 is True.)"

- After Event1, Event2 must happen.
- After Event3, Event4 must happen.
- After Event4, Event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- The initial occurrence of Event2 creates an outstanding obligation: Event1 must occur at some future point.
- Moving to the next state does not remove that obligation; it still must be satisfied eventually.
- No allowed successor sequence can avoid fulfilling that obligation: any allowed run that includes Event2 (including the initial one) requires Event1 later. Other events (e.g., Event4, Event3) could occur, but those either do not cancel the obligation or they themselves lead back to Event2 (and thus again to Event1). There is no permitted continuation in which Event1 never occurs.

- Therefore, in the next state it is guaranteed that Event1 will eventually happen, so C2 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: If event1 happens, then event4 happens.
   - C2: If event3 happens, then C1 holds (i.e. event3 → (event1 → event4)).

2. Examine the given rules (transitions):
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
   - After event2: event4 must happen.
   - After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen.
   - After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.

3. Show C1 holds:
   - Whenever event1 occurs, the rules force either event4 immediately, or event2 next.
   - If event2 occurs, the rule forces event4 afterward.
   - Thus every possible continuation after event1 leads to event4 (possibly after one intermediate event2). So C1 is entailed by the context.

4. Conclude about C2:
   - C2 states that if event3 happens then C1 holds. But C1 is already true from the rules (it does not depend on event3).
   - Therefore the implication “if event3 then C1” is true.

Hence C2 is True."

- C2 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

- Context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true.
- Also, ""After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.""
- And ""After event2, event4 must happen"" and ""After event4, event2 must happen"" (they force each other).

From event1 having happened, consider the two allowed cases:
- If event2 happens after event1, then C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is satisfied.
- If event4 happens after event1, then because event4 implies event2 happens afterward, event2 also happens. So C1 is satisfied in this branch too.

- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event1 must happen; after event1, event3 must happen. So without other triggers the system cycles 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...
- The only rule that can introduce event2 is: after event4, either event2 or event3 must happen. Thus event2 can occur only as a consequence of a prior event4.

Step 3 — derive C1 from the conditions
- Because event2 cannot occur except after event4, whenever event2 happens there must have been an event4. Hence C1 (event2 -> event4) is true in this system.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that if event4 happens then C1 holds. We have shown C1 holds unconditionally from the rules, so in particular it holds whenever event4 happens. Therefore C2 is true.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens, so the next must be event3 (rule: after event4, event3 must happen).
- From event3 you can choose event1 or event4. To get event2 at all you must take the event3 → event1 option.
- But event2 can only occur after event1 (rule: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen). So any occurrence of event2 is immediately preceded by event1.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur immediately after that initial event2.
- Thus there is a time at which event1 holds (so C1, which is just event1, holds).

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 means “Event4 does not happen” (no 4 anywhere from that point).
- C2 means “eventually C1 holds” — there is some time after which Event4 never happens.

Examine the rules and possible traces (we start with event3):

- From 3 we may go to 1 or 4.
  - If we choose 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... (always choose 1 after 2), then Event4 never occurs and C1 holds (indeed from the start). So there exist executions where C2 is satisfied.
  - But we can also choose 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... (always choose 3 after 4 and 4 after 3). This infinite trace has Event4 occurring forever, so C1 never holds at any time, and therefore C2 fails on this execution.

Because there exists at least one valid execution where C2 does not hold, C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions. Therefore the statement “C2 is True” is false."

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at all future steps/event occurrences)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1.
The question: Is C2 true or false?

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So the sequence starts event1 → event2.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, no further events can happen (terminal).
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence that falsifies C1
- From the required start: event1 → event2.
- After event2 we are allowed to choose event3. If we do, the sequence is event1, event2, event3, and then it stops.
- In that run, after the initial event1, there are points (e.g., when event3 occurs) where event1 does not occur — so ""Event1 always happens"" is false (a single counterexample run suffices).

Conclusion
- C1 is false (it is not true that event1 always happens), therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What the hypothesis asks
- C1 states: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens.""
- C2 states: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means there is a possible future point after which C1 is true (equivalently, C1 becomes true at some time and from that time on it holds).

2. The transition rules (edges)
- From 3 → {1,2}
- From 1 → {2,4}
- From 2 → {1,4}
- From 4 → {2}

3. Construct a counterexample run
- Start at the initial event3. Choose the branch 3 → 1.
- From 1 choose 2 (allowed). From 2 choose 1. Repeat:
  3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
- This infinite run respects all rules: 1→2 is allowed, 2→1 is allowed, and 3→1 was allowed initially.
- In this run event1 occurs infinitely often but event4 never occurs.

4. Consequence for C1 and C2
- On this run, C1 (""if event1 then event4"") is violated whenever event1 occurs (because it is followed by event2, not event4), so C1 does not hold at those times — indeed it never holds along this run.
- Therefore C1 does not eventually become true on this run. Since such a run is allowed, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed and is false.

So C2 is False."

- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every allowed scenario, Event3 does not happen).
We must determine whether C2 is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Initially event2 happened (so the timeline starts with event2).
2. There is a constraint: after event2, event4 must happen. So any valid sequence must include event4 at some point after event2.
3. There is a constraint: after event3, no other events can happen. Thus if event3 ever occurs, nothing can occur afterwards — in particular, event4 could not occur after that.
4. Combining (2) and (3): since event4 must occur after event2, event3 cannot occur at any point after event2 (because if event3 occurred after event2 it would block the required event4).
5. Could event3 occur before event2? No — the problem states event2 happened initially, so nothing occurs before it.
6. Could event3 occur concurrently or in some other way? No allowance is given for that; any occurrence of event3 would prevent the required event4 from occurring after event2.
7. Therefore, in every valid execution consistent with the constraints, event3 cannot occur. So C1 holds in all cases.

C2 is True."

Explanation (concise):

Interpret C1 as ""event4 never occurs (from now on)"" and C2 as ""event4 eventually never occurs (there is a future point after which event4 never happens)"".

- Start: event4 happened initially.
- From event4 the next event must be event1 or event3.
- From event1 the next must be event3 or event4.
- From event3 the next must be event2 or event4.
- From event2 the next must be event4.

Thus any run leaving event4 will, within at most three steps (1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 or via other choices), return to event4. Event4 therefore recurs and cannot be permanently avoided from some future point onward. So C1 can never hold as a persistent property, and C2 is false."

- If the branch where event1 happens is taken, then both event3 (initial) and event1 (next) occur, so C1 holds.

- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.

Assume C1 holds: whenever event2 happens, event3 happens (so the ""after event2"" choice of event4 is disallowed).

Trace a possible sequence under that assumption:
- Start: event2 (given).
- By C1, after event2 we must have event3.
- After event3, we may choose event1 (allowed by ""either event1 or event4"").
- After event1, choose event2 (allowed by ""either event2 or event3"").
- By C1, after that event2 we must have event3, and we are back where we started.

This yields an infinite cycle 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → ... that never includes event4, and it respects all rules plus C1. Therefore event4 is not forced by C1 and the context.

- If after event4 the choice is event3, then the rule forces event2 next, so event2 will occur one step later — again satisfying C1.

From the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So the next state after the initial state is necessarily event2. Therefore C1 (event1 in the next state) is false for the initial step.

Now evaluate C2. C2 claims that whenever event1 happens, the next state will also be event1. But the rules say after event1 the next state must be either event2 or event3 (1 -> {2,3}); there is no 1 -> 1 transition. Thus if event1 happens at some state, the following state cannot be event1, so C1 would be false in that situation. Therefore the implication ""if event1 happens then C1 holds"" is not satisfied.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is ""Event1 does not happen OR event2 happens"".
- To show C2 is not necessarily true, give a valid event sequence where both disjuncts are false: event1 does happen, and event2 never happens.
- Start: initially event3 happened.
- From event3 we may choose event1 (allowed: after event3 either event1 or event4).
- From event1 we may choose event4 (allowed: after event1 either event2, event3, or event4).
- After event4 no further events can happen, so the sequence is event3 → event1 → event4. In this sequence event1 occurs and event2 does not.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false and event2 does not happen, so C2 is false."

Examine the constraints:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event4 must happen (event4 must occur at some later point).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, a later event1 must occur).
- After event3, event4 must happen.

Can event3 occur in a valid execution? Yes. Example valid sequence:
- event1 (initial),
- event3,
- event4.

This satisfies:
- event1 has a later event4,
- event3 has a later event4,
- after event4 no further events occur,
- the event2→event1 rule is irrelevant (no event2 occurs).

So there is a valid run in which event3 happens. Therefore ""Event3 does not happen"" is not guaranteed to always hold, so C2 is False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and initial state:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- Rule: ""After Event2, no other events can happen."" So Event2 is terminal — there are no events in the next state after Event2.
- Other rules (after Event1 → Event4, after Event4 → Event3, after Event3 → Event1 or Event2 or Event4) are irrelevant because they only apply if those events occur; they do not apply here since Event2 already occurred and forbids any subsequent events.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: event4 -> event1.
- Assume C1 holds and start from the initial event4 (given).
- By C1, event1 must occur after that event4.
- From event1, the rules allow either event2 or event4 next.
- It is allowed to repeatedly choose event4 each time (event1 -> event4), and then by C1 again event1 follows, producing an infinite loop: event4, event1, event4, event1, ...
- In that execution no event2 ever occurs. Since C2 claims event2 must happen whenever C1 holds, but we have a valid counterexample execution where it does not, C2 is not entailed.

Reasoning summary:

- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen. So event3 is possible (e.g., choose event1 → event3), but not forced.
- There are valid sequences avoiding event3 entirely (e.g., event1 → event2 → event1 → ...), so event3 need not occur.
- C1 asserts ""event3 happens"" (tautologically repeated). C2 asserts the negation (""event3 does not happen"").
- Because the context allows both possibilities (event3 may or may not occur), C2 is not entailed. Hence C2 is False."

- After event3, event4 must happen → s2 has event4.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 simplifies to ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2 says: if event3 happens then event2 happens.
- From the context we can follow transitions: 4 -> {2,3}, 3 -> {1,4}, 1 -> {2,4}, 2 -> {1,4}.
- Starting from the initial event4, choose the transitions 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... . This infinite loop is allowed (3 can be followed by 4, and 4 can be followed by 3), so event3 can occur while event2 never occurs.

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):
- Hypothesis C2 requires both: (a) event4 eventually happens (C1), and (b) event3 happens.
- Condition: initially event3 already happened, so (b) is satisfied.
- But C1 is not guaranteed. From the transition rules you can choose 3 -> 1 and 1 -> 3 repeatedly, producing the infinite trace 3,1,3,1,... which never visits event4 and respects all given rules.
- Therefore event4 does not necessarily eventually happen, so C1 is false and hence C2 (C1 and event3) is false."

- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., event3 never happens in any possible run).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen. (This rule appears twice but duplication doesn't change anything.)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state
- From initial event4, the next step must be either event2 or event3.
  - If next is event3, then event3 happens (violates C1).
  - If next is event2, then by the rule “after event2, event3 must happen,” event3 happens afterwards (still violates C1).

There is no choice that avoids event3: both branches from the initial event4 lead to event3 occurring.

- C1 is false (event3 does happen).

- Initially event2 has happened, so the “event2 happens” part of C1 is satisfied in the initial state.
- After event2, the rules allow either event1 or event4.
- If we choose event1 next, then after event1 we may choose event3 (allowed by the rule “after event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen”).
- If event3 occurs, no further events can happen, so event4 never occurs in that run.

- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step event4 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asking whether, from the state immediately after the initial one, it is guaranteed that event4 will happen at every subsequent step.
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the constraints and the initial event3.

Step 2 — examine the constraints
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2, event4 must happen next.
- After event4, event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace possible futures from the next state
From the initial event3, the next state is either:
A) event1, or
B) event2.

- If next = event2: then by the rules event4 must follow, but after that event2 must follow, so the run contains event2 states as well as event4 states. Thus event4 is not present at every state.
- If next = event1: then either event2 or event4 follows. In either case, after those events the rules force alternation between event2 and event4; again there are states that are event2, so event4 does not occur at every state.

Also note: even if the next state were event4, the very next step must be event2, so event4 cannot hold at every subsequent state.

Step 4 — conclusion
There is no possible future from the next state in which event4 holds at every step. Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state.

- Initially event3 happened. The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur at some point.

- Nothing in the premises forces event4 to occur before event1. The only required sequence starting from the given initial event3 is to have event1 next and then stop.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" makes event2 terminal: once event2 occurs, the sequence ends and no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.
- Therefore, unless event1 had already happened before or exactly at the initial moment, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- The context only states that initially event2 happened (it does not state event1 also happened initially). So there is no way to ensure event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2.

Step 3 — check C1:
- If event4 happens, then by ""after event4 → event2"" we get event2, then by ""after event2 → event3"" we get event3, then by ""after event3 → event1"" we get event1. So event4 entails that event1 will happen. Therefore C1 is true (entailed).

Step 4 — check whether event2 happens (the second part of C2):
- Starting from the initial event1, the rule ""after event1 → either event3 or event4"" allows a choice. If the choice is always event3, the system can cycle 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 … indefinitely, never producing event4 or event2. Thus event2 is not guaranteed to occur by the given constraints.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the statements:
   - C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — read as: from now on, at every step the event is event3 (temporal logic: G(event3)).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — read as: at some future point, C1 becomes true (F G(event3)).

2. Examine the rules:
   - Initially: event3 occurred.
   - After event3 must come event1. (So no two consecutive event3's are allowed.)
   - After event1: next is either event3 or event4.
   - After event4: next is either event2 or event3.
   - After event2: next must be event3.

3. Trace possible sequences starting from the initial event3:
   - Start: 3 (given).
   - After 3 → must be 1. So the next event is 1. Already the sequence is 3,1 — so not ""always 3"".
   - From 1 you can choose 3 or 4. If you choose 3, you get 3,1,3,1,... (alternation), so 1's keep appearing. If you choose 4 then maybe 3 later, but every time a 3 occurs it is followed by a 1. Thus there is no point after which every event is 3.

4. Conclusion:
   - It is impossible to reach a future point from which only event3 occurs (because any event3 forces a subsequent event1). Therefore F G(event3) (C2) is false."

- After event4, event1 must happen (event4 → event1), so the sequence event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ... is a valid infinite sequence that never contains event3 and satisfies all constraints.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- C1 = ""Event3 always happens"" means in the current state and all future states every event is event3.
- From the initial state (event4), the next event can be event1, event2, or event3.
- Take the successor state where event1 occurs (this is allowed). From event1 the only allowed next events are event2 or event4 — so event3 does not always occur after that state. Hence C1 is false in that successor.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., every next-state must satisfy ""event3 always happens""). But we have a next-state (event1) that does not satisfy C1, so C2 is false."

Reasoning:
- From the facts: sequence must start with event1, and then exactly one of event2, event3, or event4 occurs; after any of those (2, 3, or 4) no further events can happen.
- That yields three possible executions: 1→2, 1→3, or 1→4.
- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") would require event4 in every possible execution, but there are executions 1→2 and 1→3 where event4 does not occur. So C1 is false.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just event2, and it is true because we are told initially event2 happened.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" — so C2 requires event3 to occur.
- Inspecting the rules: none of them forces event3 to ever happen. From the initial event2 we are forced to a sequence of event1 or event4 (and those force each other back to event2/event1), but there is no rule that entails event3.
- Therefore C2 does not follow from the given information. (It could be true in a run where someone additionally makes event3 occur, but it is not entailed by the statements.)

- From event2: next must be one of {event1, event4}.
- From event3: next must be one of {event1, event2}.

- Choices are nondeterministic, so any allowed choice may be taken.

Step 3 — Find a counterexample sequence

  - Each step respects the rules (1→2 allowed, 2→1 allowed).
  - In this run, event3 never happens.

- From the context: initially event1 occurs. The rule ""after event1, event4 must happen"" forces the next state to have event4. Then ""after event4, event1 must happen"" forces the following state to have event1. So one legal infinite trace is: S0: event1, S1: event4, S2: event1, S3: event4, ...

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened. The rule says: after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen next.
- C1 asserts ""Event3 does not happen."" For C1 to hold in the next state (C2), event3 would have to be impossible next.
- But the rules allow event3 to occur next (it's one of the required alternatives). Therefore event3 might happen, so you cannot guarantee C1 in the next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 always holds"", where C1 is ""Event2 happens and Event4 happens"".
- We must check whether in every allowed sequence of events both Event2 and Event4 occur (i.e., C1 holds in all possible executions).

Examine the transition rules:
- From event2 → either event1 or event3.
- From event3 → either event1 or event2.
- From event1 → either event3 or event4.
- From event4 → either event2 or event3.
- Initially event2 happened.

Find a counterexample sequence that respects the rules but avoids event4:
- Start at event2 (given).
- From event2 choose event3.
- From event3 choose event2.
- Repeat: 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... forever.

This infinite sequence obeys all rules but never includes event4. Therefore C1 (that both event2 and event4 happen) does not hold in this execution, so C1 is not guaranteed to always hold. Hence C2 is False."

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially: event4.
- After event4: either event1 or event2.
- After event1: event4.
- After event2: event1.
- After event3: either event2 or event4. (event3 never appears in the initial info except as a rule.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event4 we may choose event2, giving 4 → 2 → 1 → 4 → ...
  In that run C1 holds at the initial step (and repeatedly if we choose 2 again).

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event3 has occurred, so by ""after event3, event4 must happen"" a event4 must happen.
- After any event4, ""either event2 or event3 must happen"".
  - If event3 happens, that again forces a later event4.
  - If event2 happens, that forces a later event3, which then forces a later event4.
- So once we start from the initial event3, the system is forced into an infinite chain of events among 3,4 (and possibly 2), with a required next event always outstanding.
- Event1, by its rule, would forbid any further events after it. But because there is always a mandatory future event (from the chain of obligations), event1 cannot occur without violating the ""must"" requirements.
- Therefore event1 cannot eventually happen (C1 is false). Event4 does occur, but C2 requires C1 and event4, so C2 is false."

We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event3 is required to occur eventually, since event1 did occur initially).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen (if event2 occurs, it forces a following event).
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen (if event4 occurs, it forces a following event).

Step 3 — reasoning about possible sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" event3 must occur in every allowed sequence.
- Nothing in the rules requires event2 to occur. It is perfectly allowed to have the sequence: event1 (initial) then event3 and stop. This satisfies all constraints: event3 occurs after event1, and no events occur after event3.
- In that sequence, event2 does not occur, so C1 (""event2 and event3 happen"") is false for that sequence.

Interpretation:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate next event is event2).
- C2: ""Eventually there is a point where C1 holds"" (i.e., at some time the next event will be event2).

Reasoning through the constraints:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1 the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- If the next event is event2, C1 holds immediately, so C2 holds in that run.
- But if from event1 the next event is event4, then after event4 event3 must happen, and after event3 no further events can happen. That execution is event1 → event4 → event3 and terminates without any occurrence where the next event is event2. In that run C1 never holds, so C2 never holds.

Because there is a valid execution (event1 → event4 → event3) in which C2 does not hold, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

- Because event2 happened initially, every possible timeline already contains event2 (at the start).
- Therefore, in any timeline where event1 later occurs, event2 is already present (from the initial event).
- Even in branches where event1 is followed immediately by event4 (which stops further events), that does not negate the initial event2 — event2 still occurred earlier in the timeline.

- From event2: next is event3.

- Therefore there is a reachable point (just after event2) from which event4 will not eventually happen. That violates ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., ""always eventually event4"").

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify goal: Decide whether ""C2: If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is true under the given facts.

2. Read the conditions:
   - Initially, event4 happened.
   - After event4, no other events can happen. (So event4 is terminal and no further events occur.)
   - After event1, event4 must happen.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

3. Consequence of the first two facts: since event4 happened initially and nothing can happen after event4, no events other than event4 can occur at all. So event1, event2, and event3 do not occur.

4. Evaluate C1: ""If event2 happens, then event4 happens."" Given event4 has happened in the model, C1 is true (either vacuously because event2 does not occur, or because event4 already occurred).

5. Evaluate C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" We have C1 holding (see step 4), but event3 does not and cannot happen (step 3). So the conditional in C2 is false in this situation.

Therefore C2 is False."

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future point C1 becomes true.)

Now use the given rules:
1. Initially event2 happened.
2. After event2, event3 must happen.
3. After event3, no other events can happen (the run terminates).
4. After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
5. After event4, event2 must happen.

Trace possible executions starting from the initial condition:
- Start: event2.
- By (2), next is event3.
- By (3), after event3 nothing can happen; the run ends.

No event1 or event4 ever appears in this run. There is no way to reach event1 or event4 from the given initial event2 (event2 forces event3 then termination). Therefore event4 never occurs in any execution starting from the initial condition.

Consequences:
- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false (event4 does not happen at all).
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- From the required event1, one choice is event2, yielding event4 → event3 → event1 → event2 (then stop). In that run event2 happens.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- We have a sequence of discrete events starting with event1.
- Rules:
  1. After event1, event2 must happen.
  2. After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen (so event2 cannot follow event2 immediately).
  3. After event4, event2 must happen.
  4. After event3, event2 must happen (event3 never appears in the given start, so irrelevant here).
- From the start: event1 → event2 (by rule 1).
- After that event2 must be followed by event1 or event4. Whichever is chosen (1 or 4), it in turn must be followed by event2. So the system produces alternating pairs: ...2→1→2→1... or ...2→4→2→4...
- Because rule 2 forbids event2 immediately after event2, event2 cannot occur at every step (i.e., consecutive event2s are impossible).
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"", meaning at every step) therefore cannot hold at any time, hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens). C1 is ""Event4 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — Examine the context rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace consequences:
- From the initial event2, event1 must occur (by ""after event2, event1 must happen"").
- Once event1 occurs, event2 must occur again, and so on — so event1 and event2 will alternate indefinitely. That guarantees event1 does happen.
- Nothing in the rules forces event4 to occur (no rule says some event implies event4). Event4 may or may not happen; it is not entailed by the given premises.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2:
- The second conjunct (event1 happens) is guaranteed, but the first conjunct (C1: event4 eventually happens) is not implied by the context.
- Therefore the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed/entailed.

- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible allowed sequence).

- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.

Trace the possible branches after the initial event3:
1. If event1 happens immediately after event3, then event1 occurs — C1 holds.
2. If event2 happens after event3, then by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 will occur — C1 holds.
3. If event4 happens after event3, then by “after event4, event1 must happen,” event1 will occur — C1 holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says: whenever event2 happens, event3 happens.
- After the initial event3, the next event can be either event2 or event4.
- Consider the successor where the next event is event2. From event2 the rules permit event1 to happen next (the allowed successors of event2 are event1, event3, or event4). If event1 happens, event3 does not occur after that, so C1 is violated in that branch.
- Although in the branch where the next event is event4 C1 would be vacuously true (event2 never occurs), C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state regardless of which next state occurs. Because there is a next-state (the event2 successor) where C1 fails, C2 is false."

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. What C2 says: C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. C1 is the statement ""if event4 happens, then event1 happens"" (i.e. event4 → event1).

2. From the context: initially event4 happened, and after event4 no other events can happen. That makes the initial state terminal — there is no successor (no ""next"") state.

3. In standard temporal semantics, a ""next"" assertion (X φ) is false at a terminal state because there is no next state to evaluate φ in. So ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false in the given scenario.

(Also note: C1 already fails in the initial state because event4 occurred but event1 did not; but the key reason C2 is false is that there is no next state in which to evaluate C1.)

Therefore C2 is False."

Start state: event3 has happened.

From the rules:
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Consider the branch where, after the initial event3, event1 happens. That is allowed by the rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen."" Once event1 occurs, no further events can occur. In that branch:
- Event2 does not happen.
- Event4 does not happen.

Thus there is a permitted sequence where event2 does not occur and event4 does not occur. Therefore:

- Event4 is not guaranteed to always happen.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" i.e. starting from the next state, C1 must be true in all possible future executions.

- Initially event1 happened.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample

- After that event2, event1 must happen (by rule).
- After that event1 we may again choose event2 (allowed).
- Repeat: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 … indefinitely.

Examine the conditions and trace possible sequences:
- Initially (state0) event3 happened.
- Rule after event3: the next state (state1) must be either event2 or event4. So state1 ∈ {event2, event4}.
- If state1 = event2, rule ""after event2, event4 must happen"" forces state2 = event4.
  Then ""after event4, event2 must happen"" forces state3 = event2, and so on. So once you hit event2 or event4 you are forced into an infinite alternation 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 …
- If state1 = event4, similarly state2 must be event2, then state3 event4, etc., the same alternating loop.
- Nowhere do any rules allow event1 to occur: no rule requires or permits a transition to event1, and the obligations after 2 or 4 force staying within {2,4}. After event1 there are obligations, but nothing produces event1 later.

Event1 can never occur in any future state given the initial event3 and the mandatory rules. Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") never becomes true at any future point, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 asserts ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) and ""event1 happens"".
- From the context: start with event4. After event4, you may have event1 or event2. After event2, you may have event1 or event4.
- A valid sequence is 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → ... (always choosing the event4 option after event2 and the event2 option after event4). In this sequence event1 never occurs.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What the hypothesis claims
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event3 happens."" (i.e. every occurrence of event4 implies event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" We must determine whether both parts are true.

2. Key facts from the context
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.

3. Consequences
- Because event4 happened initially and event4 is terminal, no other events can occur at any time (there are no events after that initial event4).
- Therefore event2 does not occur (it cannot happen after the initial event4, and nothing in the context says it happened before).
- C1 requires that when event4 happens, event3 happens. In the given scenario event4 happens but event3 does not occur (and cannot occur after event4 because event4 is terminal). Thus C1 is not satisfied by the context.
- Since C1 is false and event2 also does not happen, the conjunction C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is false.

Final verdict: False."

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" — i.e., at state1.
- Hypothesis C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., at state1, C1 is true, which means event4 happens at state2 (two steps from the initial state).

From the context:
- At the initial state (state0) event4 happened.
- After event4, the next state (state1) must be either event1 or event3.

Consider the two possible branches for state1:
1. state1 = event1. Then after event1, either event2 or event4 must happen at state2. So event4 at state2 is possible; in this branch C1 holds at state1, so C2 is true.
2. state1 = event3. Then after event3, event2 must happen at state2, so event4 at state2 is impossible; in this branch C1 does not hold at state1, so C2 is false.

Since there is at least one valid branch where C2 is false, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. Therefore the correct answer is False."

- C2 says ""C1 always holds"", i.e. in every possible sequence consistent with the constraints, C1 (Event1 happens and Event4 happens) is true. We must decide if that is necessarily true.

Step 2 — restate the constraints
- Initially event3 occurred.
- After event1, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2 (no other choice).
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4, if it occurs, must be final).

Step 3 — examine possibilities / produce a counterexample
- From the initial event3, the rule ""after event3"" forces the next event to be either event1 or event2.
- Choose event2. Then by the rule after event2, event3 must happen. After that event3 again forces either event1 or event2.
- We can repeatedly choose event2 each time: sequence 3,2,3,2,3,2,... This satisfies all constraints and never contains event1 or event4.
- Thus there exists a valid run in which C1 (event1 and event4 happen) is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is at least one valid sequence where C1 does not hold, C1 does not hold in all possible sequences. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.

- If the next event is event4, the rules force event2 afterwards, and again either event1 or event4.
- Therefore there is a valid infinite trace: event2 (initial) → event4 → event2 → event4 → ... in which event1 never occurs.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Identify the claim: C1 is ""Event4 happens or event1 happens."" C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., in every reachable situation).

- From the conditions: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2 no other events can happen. Thus every execution starts with event1 and then event2, and stops. Event4 never needs to occur in that execution.

- Because event1 happened initially, the disjunction in C1 is satisfied (event1 has occurred). That fact persists in the history of all reachable states (every reachable state comes from the initial state where event1 occurred).

- Therefore in every reachable situation C1 is true, so C2 is True."

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts that whenever event1 is absent (C1), event3 will occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no further events can happen (terminal).
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen (not needed here but noted).

Step 3 — trace sequences assuming C1 (event1 does not happen)
- The initial event4 requires either event1 or event2 next. If event1 is ruled out, the only allowed choice is event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen (by rule).
- Thus under C1 the sequence is event4 → event2 → event3, so event3 does occur.

Conclusion
- There is no allowed sequence where event1 never happens and event3 also does not happen. Therefore C2 is True.

3) Consider the two possible immediate next states:

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e. at time t+1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" => at time t+1, C1 is true, i.e. event1 happens at time t+2. So C2 asserts event1 at time t+2.

Step 2 — apply the given rules starting from the initial state
- Initially (time t) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen. So at time t+1 event1 happens. Therefore C1 is true.
- Rule: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. So from the state at t+1 (where event1 occurred), the event at t+2 must be event2 or event3 — not event1.
- Either choice (event2 or event3) at t+2 leads (by the rules) to event1 at t+3, but that does not affect t+2.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires event1 at t+2. But from the rule after event1, t+2 must be event2 or event3, so event1 does not occur at t+2. Thus C2 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 occurred. The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" forces the next state to be event2.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" then forces the subsequent state to be event1, and this alternation repeats forever (event1 ↔ event2).
- Event4 can only occur after event3 (""After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen""), but there is no rule allowing event3 to occur after either event1 or event2, so event3 (and thus event4) never appears in the reachable sequence.
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false (the next state is event2). Consequently C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false."

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1 one of {event2, event3, event4} must follow.
  - If event1 → event3, event3 has occurred.
  - If event1 → event2, then event2 → event4 (forced) and then event4 → event3 (forced); so event3 occurs.
  - If event1 → event4, then event4 → event3 (forced); so event3 occurs.
- Therefore in every possible continuation event3 will occur — C1 holds.

- But event4 is not guaranteed in every continuation. For example, take event1 → event3, then choose event3 → event1, then event1 → event3, etc. You can loop between event1 and event3 indefinitely and never perform event4. Thus “event4 happens” is not entailed.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event4 has happened.
- From event4 the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- If event1 happens, the next event must be event2 or event4. If it is event2, event2 forces event4. If it is event4, we already have event4. So from event1 you inevitably reach event4 next (maybe via event2).
- If event3 happens, event3 forces event1, and from event1 as just shown you inevitably reach event4.
- Thus from any occurrence of event4 the system is forced to reach event4 again (possibly after 1 or 2 intermediate events). There is no path that avoids returning to event4.
- Therefore event4 always occurs (indeed infinitely often) in every possible execution, so C1 holds, and hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True."

1) Identify C1 and C2:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds — equivalently, ""Event2 happens or Event3 does not happen.""

2) Use the given conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. So C1 is false (event3 does happen).
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1 or event4, no further events can happen (both are terminal).
- After event2, one of {event1, event3} must happen (and then the process continues according to the rules).

3) Reason about possible sequences starting from the initial event3:
- If after the initial event3 we get event1, the sequence is 3 → 1 and then stops. Event2 never happens, and C1 is false.
- If after 3 we get event4, the sequence is 3 → 4 and then stops. Event2 never happens, and C1 is false.
- Alternatively, we could have 3 → 2 → … (in which case event2 does happen).

Because there exist valid continuations (e.g., 3 → 1) where event2 does not happen and C1 is false, C2 is not guaranteed.

  - If event4 happens directly after event1, then event4 happens.
  - If event3 happens after event1, then by the second rule event4 must happen after that.
- In both possible cases following event1, event4 necessarily happens. So C1 (""event1 implies event4"") is true.

C2 claims C1 does not hold; that claim is false.

- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen → at time2 we may have event2 or event3 (non-deterministic choice).

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is being asked
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event2 happens"" (both occur).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible valid event sequence both event4 and event2 occur.
We must decide whether every sequence consistent with the context contains both event4 and event2.

2. Examine the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen next.
- After event3, event2 must happen (event2 must occur at some point after event3).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

3. Enumerate possible valid sequences starting from event1
- If next is event2: sequence = event1 → event2. Contains event2 but not event4.
- If next is event3: sequence must be event1 → event3 → event2 (because event2 must follow event3). Contains event2 but not event4.
- If next is event4: sequence = event1 → event4. Contains event4 but not event2.

No sequence contains both event2 and event4 because they are alternate terminal continuations after event1 (and event4 cannot occur after event3 because that would prevent the required event2).

4. Conclusion
Since there exist valid sequences (in fact, multiple) where both event4 and event2 do not both occur, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in all cases. Therefore C2 is False."

- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (a tautology)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules and initial event3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1 is trivially true (A → A always holds).
- The rules from the context:
  - Initially event3 has happened.
  - After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen (choice).
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice).
  - After event1, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One possible sequence: event3 → event2 → event1 → event4 → ... In this branch event1 does happen.
- But there is also a looping sequence that avoids event1: event3 → event4 → event3 → event4 → ... Here after event4 you choose event3, and after that you can choose event4 again, never taking the event2 branch that would force event1. The rules permit this infinite alternation, so event1 is not guaranteed to occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 holds, but event1 is not guaranteed (it may or may not happen depending on choices).
- Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is not guaranteed/true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at the initial state (state0), this means state1 = event4.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted at state0, this says that at state1 the formula C1 is true — i.e. state2 = event4 (so C2 amounts to ""event4 happens two steps from now"").

From the rules and the initial condition:
- state0 = event3.
- After event3, state1 may be event2 or event4.

Counterexample showing C2 can be false:
- Choose state1 = event4 (allowed, since after event3 either event2 or event4).
- After event4, state2 may be event1 or event3. Choose state2 = event1 (allowed).
- Now at state1, C1 (""event4 in the next state"") is false because state2 = event1, not event4. Thus C2 is false at state0.

- C1 = (event4 happens AND event2 happens).
- C2 = (C1 holds) OR (event1 happens). So C2 is true iff either both event4 and event2 occur, or event1 occurs.

Step 2 — the rules / conditions (transitions)
- Initially event3 occurred.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1 → event3 must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event4 → event2 must happen.

Step 3 — construct a sequence consistent with the rules that makes C2 false
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose after event3 → event2 (allowed).
- After event2 → choose event3 (allowed).
- After event3 → choose event2 again, and repeat 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 … indefinitely.

In this sequence:
- event1 never occurs,
- event4 never occurs (so C1 = event4 AND event2 is false, since event4 does not happen),
- event2 does occur but that alone doesn't make C1 true.

Thus neither C1 nor event1 holds, so C2 is false in this valid sequence.

- C1 = ""Event4 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state."" So we must decide whether, in the immediate next state after the initial situation, both event4 and event2 occur.

Step 2 — unpack the rules
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen (but that is one step later).
- After event2, event3 must happen (next).
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine possible next states
- From the initial event3, the next state must be either event1 or event2.
  - If the next state is event2, then event4 does not happen in that next state (event4 cannot co-occur there), so C1 is false in the next state.
  - If the next state is event1, event4 might happen later (after event1) but not in that immediate next state; thus in the next state both event2 and event4 do not hold simultaneously. Also, if event4 ever happens later, no events can follow it, so you cannot have event4 and then later event2.

- It is not the case that both event4 and event2 happen in the immediate next state. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- If C1 holds then the disjunction in C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") is true regardless of whether event4 occurs.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""  
  Hypothesis C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution (from every point) event3 will eventually occur.

- From the conditions:
  - Initially event1 occurs.
  - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event3 (and after event4), no further events can happen.

- Trace analysis:
  - From the initial event1 we may choose event3 next; that would satisfy C1.
  - But we may instead choose event2; after event2 event1 must happen, returning us to the same choice (after event1 choose event2 or event3).
  - This allows the infinite trace: event1, event2, event1, event2, event1, event2, ... which satisfies all constraints but never contains event3.

- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed in all executions, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Now examine the transition rules and possible traces starting from the initial event4:

- From event4 the next event can be event1, event2, or event3.
  - If event4 → event1, then after event1 no other events can happen, so the run is 4 → 1 and event3 never occurs.
  - If event4 → event2, then from event2 the next event must be event1 or event3.

- If event3 occurs next, then the following state must be event4, then event3, etc. (alternation 3,4,3,4,...).
- At no point is event2 required by the rules; it may never occur.

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is not guaranteed after the initial state (the next state must be 3 or 4, not necessarily 2).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is not entailed by the given conditions.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Clarify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — interpreted as: at every future state, event3 holds (i.e., G(event3)).
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — means: in the state after the initial one, C1 is true (so from that next state onward event3 always holds).

2. Use the given rules:
   - Initially: event1 happens.
   - After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
   - After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen next.
   - After event3: event4 must happen next.
   - After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen next.

3. Exhibit counterexamples:
   - From the initial event1 you can choose event2 next. Then follow with event1, then event2, etc.: 1,2,1,2,... This infinite trace is allowed by the rules and never has event3. So C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false in that next state (indeed false from the start).
   - Even if the next state were event3, the rules force event4 next, so event3 would not hold at every subsequent state; thus C1 would still fail.

4. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not true.

Final answer: False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypotheses:
  - C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
  - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. from the state reached after the first transition, event4 is guaranteed to eventually occur.

- From the context: initially event1 happened. After event1 the next event must be either event2 or event3.

- Case 1: If the next event is event2, then after event2 event4 must happen, so C1 would hold in that next state.

- Case 2: If the next event is event3, the rules allow the next choice to be event1 (since after event3 either event1 or event2 must happen). From event1 we can again choose event3, and so on. This yields an infinite cycle: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... that never reaches event2 or event4.

- Because there exists a possible next-state (the one where event3 occurs) from which event4 can be avoided forever, C1 is not guaranteed in the next state. Therefore C2 is false."

- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" So C2 claims: whenever event1 occurs, it implies that event2 always happens.

Step 2 — examine the given rules
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences starting from the initial situation
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 will occur next.
- After that event2, ""after event2, event1 must happen"", so event1 occurs again, then event2 again, and so on. This enforces an alternating 1,2,1,2,... pattern.
- The event3↔event4 subsystem cannot start because there is no rule that ever generates event3 or event4 from event1 or event2; they are never introduced given the initial state, so they do not affect the behavior.
- Therefore, once event1 has occurred (indeed it did initially), event2 will necessarily occur and in fact will continue to occur repeatedly.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Given the rules and the initial event1, whenever event1 occurs it forces event2 to occur (and the system remains in the 1↔2 cycle), so the claim that ""if event1 happens, then C1 (event2 always happens)"" is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 is ""Event1 happens and event4 happens."" C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., there is some future point where both Event1 and Event4 have occurred.
- Initially Event4 has already happened (given).
- From Event4 the rules allow Event3 to happen next (after Event4, either Event2 or Event3 must happen).
- From Event3 the rules allow Event1 to happen next (after Event3, either Event1 or Event4 must happen).
- So one possible sequence is: Event4 (initial) → Event3 → Event1. At that point both Event4 (earlier) and Event1 (now) have happened, so C1 holds, and thus C1 eventually holds.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step).
- From the rules: after any occurrence of event4 the next event must be either event1 or event3. Thus you can never have two consecutive event4 occurrences, so there is no suffix of a trace in which every step is event4.
- Therefore C1 is never satisfied at any point (it cannot become true eventually). Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False."

1. From the context: initially event2 happens. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
2. That means after the mandatory sequence event2 → event1, it is valid to choose event3 next.
3. Thus there exists a valid sequence in which event3 does occur (e.g. event2, event1, event3, ...).

Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to hold in all runs, so C2 is False.

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 says: event3 happens AND event2 happens.
- C2 says: event3 happens AND C1 holds — which is equivalent to event3 happens AND event2 happens (C2 is the same as C1).

The question is whether C2 is true given the rules (i.e., whether event3 and event2 must occur).

Step 2 — examine the rules / constraints
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen → so next is event4.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event4} must happen.
(One rule is repeated but doesn’t change the set of constraints.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Starting: event3 → event4.
- From event4 you could choose event2 (giving event2), or event1 (which forces event2 afterward), or event3.
- However, it is allowed to choose event3 after event4, which forces event4 again, so one can loop: event3 → event4 → event3 → event4 → ...
- That loop avoids event2 indefinitely.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a permitted sequence (the infinite loop between event3 and event4) in which event2 never occurs, event2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Thus C1 (event3 and event2) is not entailed, and so C2 is not guaranteed.
Final answer: False"
