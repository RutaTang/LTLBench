3. From the initial state (event4), the system can move to event1 (after event4 either event1 or event3 must happen).
4. In the state event1, event4 is false (and after event1 no other events can happen).
5. Since C1 is true in that event1 state but event4 is false there, the implication in C2 fails.

3. From the context: initially event3; after event3, event4 must happen; after event4 no other events can happen.
4. So there is a reachable successor state where event4 holds and event2 does not.

1. Interpret the context as a state-transition system with exclusive events {event1,event2,event3,event4} and transitions:
   - Initially: event1.
   - From event1 → next is event2 or event4.
   - From event2 → next is event1 or event3 or event4.
   - From event4 → next is event1 (must).
   - From event3 → no other events can happen (event3 is a sink, it stays at event3).

2. C1: ""Event4 always happens"" means G(event4) — event4 holds now and at every future state. Check whether C1 can hold at any reachable state:
   - At the initial state event1, event4 is false, so C1 does not hold there.
   - At a state where event4 holds, the next state must be event1, so event4 cannot hold in the next state. Thus C1 cannot hold at any state (there is no state from which event4 holds at all future times).

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is an implication. Since C1 is impossible (false in every reachable state), the implication is vacuously true in every state.

Therefore C2 is True.

2. Start state: event2.

3. From event2 the allowed next events are: event1, event3, or event4.
   - If next = event1, event1 has happened immediately.
   - If next = event4, the rule ""after event4, event1 must happen"" forces event1 in the following step.
   - If next = event3, the rule ""after event3, event4 must happen"", and then after event4 event1 must happen, so event1 occurs within two steps.

4. Therefore on every possible path starting from the initial state event2, event1 occurs eventually. So C1 is true at the initial state, and hence C2 (equivalent to C1) is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 states: ""Event3 does not happen"" — meaning event3 never occurs anywhere on the timeline.
2. C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event3 must never occur (ever).
3. From the context: initial state is event2.
4. From event2 the rules allow going to event1 (after event2, either event1 or event4 must happen).
5. From event1 the rules allow going to event3 (after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen).
6. Thus there is a valid execution: event2 → event1 → event3, so event3 does occur after event2.
7. That execution shows event2 occurs but C1 (event3 never occurs) is false.
8. Therefore C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is false."

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false already in the initial state because initially event4 happens, not event1.
- C2 requires that whenever event2 happens, C1 holds. But event2 can happen: from the initial event4, the system may go to event2 (after event4 either event2 or event3 must happen).
- On that trace (initial: event4 → event2 ...), event2 does occur while C1 is false (initial state is not event1). Thus the implication in C2 is violated.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 says: whenever event3 happens in some state, then in the next state event4 happens (C1).
2. The rules include: after event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen — it's a nondeterministic choice, not a forced event4.
3. Construct a concrete counterexample run: initially event4 (given). From event4 choose event3 next (allowed by ""after event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen""). Now we are in a state with event3.
4. From that event3 state we may choose event1 next (allowed by ""after event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen""). The next state is event1, not event4.
5. Thus there is a reachable state where event3 holds but C1 (event4 in the next state) does not hold. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Reasoning:
- From the context, after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen. So event1 can be followed by event3.
- C1 requires that event2 happens in the next state. That is not guaranteed after event1 (it could be event3 instead).
- Example counterexample trace: event2 (initial) → event1 → event3. At the point where event1 happens, the next state is event3, so C1 is false there, making the implication ""if event1 then C1"" false.

1. C1 is the conjunction ""Event4 happens and Event1 happens"" — interpreted as both Event1 and Event4 being true in the same state (consistent with the examples where conjunction requires simultaneous truth).
2. In this model exactly one event is true in any state, so two different events cannot be true simultaneously.

Step 2 — events per state
- As in the examples, exactly one event holds in any given state (events are mutually exclusive).

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 would require Event1 and Event4 to be true simultaneously in a single state, which is impossible given mutual exclusivity. Even though Event4 holds initially and Event1 can occur in a later state, they cannot both hold in the same state.

2. C1 is the propositional implication ""if event2 then event1"". In a single state this implication is false only if event2 is true and event1 is false simultaneously.

1. Interpret the context as a state graph where exactly one event holds per state and the ""After ..."" rules give allowed next events:
   - From event3 -> next is event1 or event2
   - From event2 -> next is event1 or event4
   - From event1 -> next is event2 or event4
   - From event4 -> next is event2
   Initial state: event3.

2. C1 is a state formula ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens"" — i.e., in a given state C1 is (event1 -> event4). Because exactly one event holds per state, C1 is false precisely in states where event1 holds (since event4 cannot also hold); in any state where event1 does not hold, C1 is true.

3. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — so we need to check that on every path from the initial state there is some future state where event1 is false (equivalently, where C1 is true).

4. From the initial event3 state:
   - If next is event2, then at that state event1 is false, so C1 is true immediately.
   - If next is event1, then the following state must be event2 or event4; both of those states have event1 false, so C1 is true at that next state.

5. There is no possible infinite run consisting only of event1 states (event1 never transitions to event1), so every path reaches a state where event1 is false and thus C1 holds.

Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True."

1. C1 asserts ""Event1 happens and Event3 happens"" — in the examples and this kind of context that means both events are true in the same state (simultaneous occurrence).

2. The context gives a single initial event (event3) and deterministic transition constraints of the form ""after eventX, either A or B (or C) must happen."" That enforces that each state is labeled by exactly one event (one event holds in a state); transitions pick one next event from the listed options, not multiple simultaneously.

3. Because at any state exactly one event can be true, Event1 and Event3 cannot be true at the same time in any state. Thus C1 is impossible (always false).

4. Therefore C2, ""C1 does not hold,"" is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. The context gives: Initially event2 happened, and after event2, event1 must happen. So the next state after the initial one must be event1 (not event2).
3. Therefore event2 does not hold in that next state, so event2 cannot hold in every state. Hence C1 is false in the model.

- Initially event1 holds.
- From event1 the only possible next events are event3 or event4.
- From event3 the only possible next events are event1 or event4.
- From event4 the only possible next event is event1.
- Therefore the only events reachable from the initial state are {event1, event3, event4}. Event2 is never reachable.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false (there are reachable states where event3 or event4 hold instead of event1).

3. From the context: initially event4, and after event4 the next event must be event2.
4. After event2, event1 is one allowed choice, so event1 can indeed occur (there is a reachable state with event1).
5. From the context: after event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3 — not event1. So if event1 occurs, the immediate next state cannot have event1, so C1 is false in that situation.

- In these problems, a bare phrase like ""Event4 does not happen"" is normally evaluated in the current state (i.e., it means ""event4 is not true in this state""), unless a temporal operator (like ""always"" or ""eventually"") is explicitly present.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event3 happened. So in the initial state: event3 = true, and all other events (including event4) are false.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 in the initial state:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" — in the initial state event4 is false, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" — event3 is true and C1 holds, so C2 is true in the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 is the claim: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C2 says: whenever we are in a state with event3, the next state must be event1.
2. From the context: after event3 the next event may be event1 or event4 (the clause ""After event3, either event1, or event4 must happen"").
3. Therefore a transition event3 -> event4 is allowed by the rules.
4. In such a state where event3 occurs and the next state is event4, C1 (event1 in the next state) is false. Hence the implication ""if event3 then C1"" is false in that state.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 is the formula (event1 -> event2).
2. C2 is (event1 -> C1) = (event1 -> (event1 -> event2)). The inner implication makes C2 logically equivalent to (event1 -> event2) (i.e. C1), so C2 holds exactly when C1 holds.
3. Check C1 in the given system: C1 requires that whenever event1 holds in a state, event2 also holds in that same state.
4. From the context: initially event2. After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen — so a state with event1 is reachable. In any state where event1 holds, event2 does not hold simultaneously (events are mutually exclusive here).
5. Therefore there is a reachable state where event1 is true but event2 is false, so C1 is false, and hence C2 is also false."

Reasoning (concise):
- The statements describe a system where each state is exactly one event (initially event1), and transitions force a single next event (e.g., after event1 either event2 or event3; after event2 one of event1, event3, event4; after event3 event1; after event4 nothing else).
- C1 requires event3 and event4 to hold simultaneously in the same state.
- By the transition structure (and the usual mutual-exclusivity of events per state), no state can have both event3 and event4 true at once. (You can have event3 at one time and event4 later, but that does not make the conjunction true in any single state.)
- Therefore C1 cannot hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 is the propositional claim ""event4 happens or event2 happens"" evaluated in the current (initial) state.

   - State2: event1 (must follow event4).
   - From event1 the system can go to event2 or to event4; if it goes to event2, the next state must be event1, etc.
3. Thus event4 and event2 occur at different states in the run (they may both occur at different times), but they can never be true simultaneously in the same state.
4. C1 is the conjunction ""event4 happens and event2 happens"" as a state formula, which would require both to hold in the same state — this is impossible under the one-event-per-state assumption. So C1 is always false.

Reasoning:
1. C1 is the state formula (event3 → event1). That is false in any state where event3 holds and event1 does not (and true in states where event3 is false).
2. C2 is (C1 → event1). To refute C2 it suffices to find a reachable state where C1 is true but event1 is false.
3. From the initial state (event3), the context allows a transition to a state where event2 happens.
4. In a state where event2 holds, event3 is false, so C1 (event3 → event1) is true (vacuously), but event1 is false in that state.
5. Thus C1 holds while event1 does not, making C2 false in that reachable state.

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and event4 happens"" — this is a conjunction that requires both event2 and event4 to be true in the same state.
2. From the context and prior examples, states are labeled by a single event happening at that state (events are mutually exclusive in a state). The context gives transitions between single-event states (e.g., after event2 either event1 or event4 happens), so two different events cannot hold simultaneously in one state.

Context summary:
- Initial state (state0): event3.
- From event3 → next must be event1 or event2.
- From event1 → next must be event2 or event4.
- From event2 → next must be event4.
- From event4 → next must be event2.

Hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., in the current state and all future states).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., from the next state onward event4 always holds).

Evaluate C2 from the initial state:
- If the next state (state1) is event2 (allowed by event3 → event1 or event2), then state1 is not event4, so C1 is false at state1. Moreover from state1 the system goes event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 ... so event4 does not hold in all states starting at state1.
- If the next state is event1 (the other allowed option), state1 is event1 (not event4), so C1 is false at state1 (and subsequent choices still include states that are not event4).

In all allowed next states, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

1. Initial state: event3 holds (given).
2. ""After event3, event1 must happen"" — so the next state has event1.
3. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — so once event1 occurs the system stays at event1 forever (no transition to event4 or anything else).

3. The pair event1/event4 forms a separate cycle (after event1 -> event4, after event4 -> event1), but there is no rule allowing a transition from event2 or event3 to event1 or event4. Thus event1 (and event4) never occur in any reachable state starting from the initial state.

6. If from event1 we always choose event2, then the mandatory transitions force: event2 → event4 → event1 → (choose event2 again) … producing an infinite cycle 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → … that never visits event3.
7. That execution is allowed by the given rules, so there exists a valid behavior in which event3 never happens.
8. Therefore F event3 (C2) does not hold in all executions; in particular it is false on the infinite 1–2–4 cycle.
9. Hence C2 is False.

1. Initially event4 holds. After event4 the next state can be event1, event2, or event3 (nondeterministically).
2. C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is ""event3 always happens"" (i.e., every future state must be event3).
3. If the next state is event1, then that state is not event3, so C1 is already false there.
4. If the next state is event2, that state is not event3, so C1 is false there.
5. If the next state is event3, C1 would require that all subsequent states remain event3. But from event3 a transition to event1 (or event2 or event4) is allowed, so future states need not be event3; thus C1 does not hold.
6. Because there exist (indeed all) possible next states in which C1 fails, C2 is not guaranteed.

2. After event1, one of event2, event3, or event4 must occur next.
3. After event2, event3, or event4, no other events can happen (each is terminal).
4. Thus possible executions are: event1 -> event2, or event1 -> event3, or event1 -> event4.
5. C1 (""Event4 always happens"") requires event4 to hold in every state (including the initial state). The initial state has event1, not event4, so C1 is false.

2. From event1 the rules require the next state to be either event3 or event4.
3. C1 is ""event3 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event3).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the propositional implication ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" evaluated in a single state.
2. Only one event can be true in any given state, so event1 and event2 cannot both be true simultaneously. Thus C1 is false in any state where event1 holds.
3. From the context: initially event2 holds, and after event2 either event1 or event4 must happen. So a state with event1 is reachable.
4. At that reachable event1 state, event2 is false, so C1 is false there.
5. Since C1 does not hold in all states, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event1 happens in the next state.""
- From the initial state event3, the next state can nondeterministically be event1 or event4. So there is a possible transition initial(event3) -> event1, making C1 true at the initial state.
- C2 claims: if C1 holds then event4 happens. That would require that whenever the next state is event1, event4 occurs (either now or inevitably later, depending on reading).
- But there is a run that refutes any such guarantee: choose transitions that always go event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> ... (from event1 choose event3; from event3 choose event1). This run makes C1 true at the initial state (since next is event1) and yet event4 never occurs.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context and is False."

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens"" — i.e., both events true in the same state.
2. The context implies a single event occurs in each state (as in the examples): initially event2; after event2 the next state is event1; after event1 the next state is 2 or 3; etc. Transitions: 2→1, 1→{2,3}, 3→{2,4}, 4→{1,2}.
3. In any given state only one event holds, so no state can have both event2 and event1 true simultaneously.
4. In particular, at the initial state event2 is true but event1 is not, so C1 is false at the initial state.

   - Thus the system can only visit events in the loop: 1 -> 4 -> (1 or 2) -> 4 -> ...
   - There is no rule that leads to event3 from any of these states. The rule ""after event3, ..."" describes what would happen if event3 occurred, but nothing causes event3 to occur in the first place.

1. C2 says: ""Eventually there is a state from which C1 (event2 always happens) holds forever.""
2. For C1 to hold at some state, that state itself must have event2 true and every future state must also have event2 true.
3. But from the context rules: after event2, the next state must be event1 or event4 — the next state cannot be event2. Therefore you can never have two consecutive states with event2.

2. Initially event3 holds, so event4 is false and therefore C1 holds in the initial state.
3. C2 is (C1 -> event2). At the initial state the antecedent (C1) is true, so for C2 to hold at the initial state event2 would have to be true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event1 holds.
2. After event1, the system nondeterministically must go to either event2 or event3.
3. If it goes event2 → event3 → event4, then both parts of C2 hold (event2 occurs and event4 eventually occurs).
4. But there is another valid execution: event1 → event3 → event4, in which event2 never occurs.
5. C1 (event4 eventually happens) is true in all executions, but ""Event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.
6. C2 requires both ""Event2 happens"" and C1; since event2 can fail to occur, C2 does not hold universally.

Therefore C2 is False."

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state, C1 is true. (Nested ""always"" is redundant: C2 is equivalent to C1.)

Step 2 — Use the context:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event4 (there are no states where any other event holds).

Step 3 — Evaluate C1:
- In the initial (and only reachable) state event4 holds, not event2.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 holds in every state"") is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:
- Since C1 is false in the initial state, C1 does not hold always; thus C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 asserts that C1 (""event1 AND event2"") holds in every state (always).
2. C1 requires event1 and event2 to be true simultaneously in a single state.
3. The model of the context is that each state records which single event happened; initially event1 happened, so the initial state has event1 = true and event2 = false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context: initially event1. From event1 the next state is either event2 or event3 (nondeterministic choice).
2. C1 is the state formula ""if event2 happens then event4 happens"" (i.e., event2 => event4 in the same state).
3. Consider the possible immediate successor states from the initial state:
   - If the next state is event2, then event2 is true and event4 is false in that same state (only one event holds at a time). Hence event2 => event4 is false there, so C1 does not hold in that successor.
   - If the next state is event3, C1 would hold there (antecedent false), but this does not matter because C2 requires C1 to hold in the next state of every possible immediate successor.
4. Because one allowed successor (event2) makes C1 false, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed at the initial state.

2. C2 asks whether eventually there is a time after which C1 holds forever (F G event2).

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 holds. The rules give the forced transitions:
  - event3 -> event1
  - event1 -> event4
  - event4 -> event1
  - (event2 would go to event4, but event2 never occurs here)
- So the run from the initial state is: event3, then event1, then event4, then event1, then event4, ... (event2 never occurs).
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is true in the initial state (because from event3 the next state is event1).
- C2 says: if C1 holds then event2 happens. In the initial state C1 holds but event2 does not happen (current event is event3), and in fact event2 never occurs in any future state of this run.
- Therefore the implication in C2 is violated, so C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event3 holds (given).
2. C1 requires event1 and event4 to hold simultaneously in a state. By the model (as in the examples), only one event can hold in a state, so event1 and event4 cannot both be true in any single state.
3. Also, no rule in the context makes event4 ever occur (initial is event3 and no transition leads to event4), so event4 never happens; therefore C1 never holds.

1. C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" means: at every state from some point onward, event1 is true (i.e., globally/eventually-for-all-times event1 holds).
2. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" means: in the immediate successor of the initial state, from that successor onward event1 must always hold.
3. From the context, the initial state is event2. From event2 the next state can be either event1 or event4 (non-deterministic choice).
4. If the next state is event4, then the mandatory next step is event2, and states with event2 or event4 are not event1. Thus starting from that successor (event4) it is not true that event1 holds at every future state — C1 fails.

1. Context summary:

   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal / the system stays at event2).
   - Other rules (about event3 and event4) are irrelevant because event3/4 are never reached from the required event1→event2 path.

2. Hypothesis:
   - C1: event4 happens or event1 happens (i.e., in a given state either event4 or event1 is true).
   - C2: C1 always holds (i.e., C1 must be true in every state along the execution).

3. Check states:
   - Initial state: event1 is true → C1 holds there.
   - Next state: event2 must happen → state where event2 is true. In that state neither event1 nor event4 is true, so C1 is false there.
   - Because event2 is terminal, C1 stays false thereafter.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. From the context: e1 -> e2 (must), e2 -> {e1 or e3}, e3 -> e4 (must), e4 -> {e1 or e3}.
2. Initially we are at event1, so the next state is event2; thus C1 (event4 in the next state) is false at the start.
3. Consider the infinite run that always chooses e2 -> e1 whenever at e2. The run is e1, e2, e1, e2, ... forever.
4. In that run, e3 and e4 never occur, so there is never a state whose next state is event4; C1 never becomes true along this run.
5. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed by the context (there exists a valid behavior where it never holds).

Hence C2 is False."

1. Initially event1 happened.

Reasoning (step by step):
1. C1 says: whenever event1 happens, event4 happens (i.e., event4 is guaranteed after event1).
2. From the context: after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
3. If event4 happens immediately, C1 is satisfied at that occurrence of event1.
4. If event3 happens next, the context requires that after event3 event4 must happen (so event4 follows in the next step).
5. Therefore in both possible continuations from any event1, event4 will occur (either immediately or one step later).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event4 happens and Event2 happens"" — interpreted as both holding in the same state.
2. From the context, exactly one event is true in any state (events are mutually exclusive), and after event2 or event4 no other events can happen (those states are terminal).
3. Therefore there is no state in which both event2 and event4 are true simultaneously, and there is no execution that contains both events at different times (once you hit event2 or event4 you cannot reach the other).

2. Initially s0 = event3. From event3, the next state s1 must be either event2 or event4.

3. Consider the branch where s1 = event4 (this branch is allowed by the context). From event4, the rules force the following state s2 to be either event1 or event3 — never event4. Thus at s1, C1 (""event4 in the next state"") is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. As in the examples, assume each state has exactly one event true at a time.
2. Initial state: event2 is true.
3. From the rules: after event2 → must be event4; after event4 → must be event2. So the system alternates event2, event4, event2, event4, ... forever.
4. There is no rule that ever produces event3, so event3 (and thus event1 which can only follow event3) is unreachable.
5. C1 = (event4 AND event1) requires both events to be true in the same state. That is impossible (only one event per state) and, moreover, event1 never occurs at any time here. So C1 is always false.
6. C2 = (C1 holds AND event2 happens) therefore is false (conjunction with a permanently false C1).

2. C1 is: event4 AND event2 (both must be true in the same state).
3. By the problem's event semantics (as in the examples), each state records which single event happened, so two different events cannot both hold simultaneously in one state.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules:

- From event1: either event2 or event3 must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- From event2: event1 must happen (forced).
- From event3: no further events (terminal).

1. As in the examples, assume exactly one event holds in each state (states are labeled by the event that happened).
2. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") means: at the current state and at all future states event2 holds.
3. From the context: after event2, the next state must be event1 or event4 — so a state labeled event2 cannot have a successor also labeled event2. Therefore no state can satisfy ""event2 holds now and at all future states.""
4. Thus C1 is never true in any reachable state.
5. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") requires some future state where C1 holds, but since C1 never holds, C2 is false."

1. Context says ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means the system starts in a state where event1 is true and remains there forever (no transitions to other events).

2. C1 is ""Event3 happens and event2 happens"" — requiring both event2 and event3 to be true (simultaneously in a state).

3. Since the system stays forever in the event1 state, neither event2 nor event3 ever occur in any state. So C1 is false in the initial state and in every state.

4. C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Because C1 is always false, C2 is false.

3. The rules for transitions after event1 require that the next state must be either event2 or event3 (after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen).

2. For C2 (C1 holds in the next state) to be true, the immediate next state must satisfy C1 — from that next state onward, every state must be labeled event3.
3. From the context, after event3 the next state must be event4. Therefore any state that is event3 is followed by event4, so event3 cannot hold at every future state starting from any state (you cannot have event3 followed by event3).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initial state: event3 is true, so event2 is false at the initial state. Thus the disjunct ""event2 happens"" in C2 is false now.

2. C1 is ""event1 eventually happens."" To make C2 true without initial event2, event1 would have to be inevitable (i.e., occur on every possible future path).

3. From event3 the rules permit going to event2 (3 -> 2). From event2 the rules permit going back to event3 (2 -> 3). Therefore there is a valid infinite trace 3,2,3,2,3,... that never contains event1.

4. From event2 the system may go to event4 (or event1), so event4 can occur at some times.
5. But the rules state: after event4, event2 must happen. Thus any state where event4 holds is followed by a state where event2 holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event1 holds.
2. C2 says: ""In the next state, eventually event4 happens"" (i.e., from the immediate successor state, event4 will occur at some future time).
3. From event1 the next state can be either event2 or event3.
4. If the next state is event2, then event4 must happen immediately afterward, so event4 does eventually happen in that branch.
5. If the next state is event3, then from event3 the system may choose event1 (or event2). If it repeatedly chooses event1 after event3 and then event3 after event1, the execution cycles between event1 and event3 forever and never visits event2 (and hence never visits event4).
6. Because there exists a possible next state (event3) and a continuation from there that avoids event4 forever, C1 (""event4 eventually happens"") does not hold in that next state.
7. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is not guaranteed from the initial state.

1. The system states are labeled by which single event ""happened"" at that state (initially event4). Transitions tell which single event can follow each event. So only one event can be true in any given state.
2. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event4 happens"" — it requires both event1 and event4 to be true simultaneously in the same state.
3. Because only one event can hold in a state, C1 can never be true in any state.
4. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 is impossible, C2 cannot become true.

Therefore, C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""Event4 always happens"" (G event4 — event4 holds in every future state).
2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (F G event4 — there is some future point from which event4 holds forever).
3. From the context: after event4, the next state must be either event1 or event3. So event4 cannot occur in two consecutive states.
4. Therefore it is impossible to reach a point from which event4 holds in every subsequent state (you would need event4 at two consecutive times, which the rules forbid).
5. Concretely, one possible trace is: initial event4 -> event3 -> event3 -> ... In that trace there is no future point after which event4 holds forever.
6. Because there exists a valid execution where F G event4 does not hold, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Thus C2 is False."

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 occurs, and after event2 event1 must occur.
- From event1 one allowed choice is event3, so a valid trace is: event2 -> event1 -> event3 -> ...
- In that trace event3 does happen, so C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is violated.
- Therefore C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

</graphml>",0,"Step 1 — simplify the formulas:
- C1 = (event3 AND event2).
- C2 = (event3 AND C1) = (event3 AND (event3 AND event2)) = (event3 AND event2).

Step 2 — evaluate against the context:
- Initially event3 is true and event2 is false, so C1 is false at the initial state.
- Thus C2 (which requires both event3 and event2 simultaneously) is false at the initial state.
- Also, by the transition rules, events are mutually exclusive per state (you move from one event to another), so no single state can have event2 and event3 true together.

Conclusion: False"
