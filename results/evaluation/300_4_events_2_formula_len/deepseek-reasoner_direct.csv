However, from the context, after event2, either event3 or event4 must happen, so C1 does not necessarily hold true in all scenarios. Specifically, if event4 happens after event2, then event3 does not happen, contradicting C1.

C2 states that if C1 holds, then event4 happens. But if C1 holds, it means that whenever event2 happens, event3 follows. In such a scenario, it is possible to have a sequence where event4 never occurs. For example, starting with event2, followed by event3 (since C1 holds), then event1, then event2 again, then event3, and so on, forming a loop without event4. Thus, even if C1 holds, event4 may not happen, making C2 false.

However, from the rules, it is possible to have a sequence where event2 never occurs. For example:
- Start with event1 (initial condition).
- After event1, event4 must happen (rule).
- After event4, if event1 is always chosen (allowed by rule), then the sequence loops: event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ... indefinitely, without event2 ever occurring.
