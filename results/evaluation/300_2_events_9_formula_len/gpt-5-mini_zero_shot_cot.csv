- Initially (s0) event2 occurred.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as: event2 holds at every state (global). In our timeline event2 is true at even states only, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1 → false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" As an implication, false → false is true, so C3 is true at every state (the antecedent C1 is false).
- C4: same as C3 → true.
- C5: C3 and C4 → true ∧ true = true (holds at every state).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is true at every state, C5 indeed holds in the next state, so C6 is true at every state.

- We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the conditions (context + hypothesis).

Step 2 — examine and simplify the conditions (let A = ""event1 happens"", B = ""event2 happens"")
- C1: B or B → simplifies to B.
- C2: C1 and B → B and B → B.
- C3: A or C2 → A ∨ B.
- C4: A or C2 → A ∨ B (same as C3).
- C5: not C4 → ¬(A ∨ B) → ¬A ∧ ¬B.
- C6: B or C5 → B ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B).
- C7: C3 or C6 → (A ∨ B) ∨ (B ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)).

Step 3 — simplify C7
- Let X = A ∨ B. Then C7 = X ∨ (B ∨ ¬X).
- But B ∨ ¬X together with X gives X ∨ ¬X (since B is a disjunct of X), and X ∨ ¬X is a tautology.
- Directly: C7 = (A ∨ B) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B) = X ∨ ¬X = True.

Step 4 — check with the context (optional)
- Context implies A is true and B must happen, so B is true; that also makes C7 true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: event1 happens initially, and events alternate (after event1 comes event2, after event2 comes event1). So event2 does occur (at least once), hence the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" is false.

2. C1, C2, C3 are all the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" — therefore each of C1, C2, C3 is false.

3. C4 is ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is true in the model, while C3 is false, so C4 is false.

4. C5 is ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both C2 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

5. C6 is ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 never holds, C6 is false.

6. C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is false, so this implication is vacuously true; hence C7 is true (and time-invariant).

7. C8 is ""C7 holds or event1 happens."" Since C7 is true, C8 is true (at all times).

8. C9 is ""C8 always holds."" Because C8 is true at every time (via C7), C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True."

- C4 and C5: each is ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Since C1 is true, both C4 and C5 are true regardless of C3.

Step 1 — identify the question
- C6 is the formula ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" (i.e. C4 → C5). We must decide its truth.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state.""
- C5 is ""C3 holds in the next state.""
They are syntactically the same statement.

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- An implication A → A is always true: it cannot be the case that A is true while A is false.
- Therefore C4 → C5 is a tautology regardless of any other facts (including the given event cycle).

- We must determine whether C9 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, no future state can have any event, in particular event2 never occurs after event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions step by step
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Event2 does not happen (no events after event1), and C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false (so it cannot hold always), thus C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 never holds, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Same as C1, so C8 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Let p mean ""event2 happens.""  
   - C1 is p → p, which is a tautology — true in every state.

2. C2 and C4 both state ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C1).  
   - Since C1 is true in every state, X C1 is true exactly in states that have a next state, and false in a terminal state (after event2, no next state).

3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"", i.e. ¬X C1.  
   - So C3 is true exactly in terminal states and false elsewhere.

4. C5 = C3 ∧ C4 = (¬X C1) ∧ (X C1).  
   - This is a contradiction: it can never be true in any state (cannot both have and not have a next-state C1).

5. C6 = eventually C5 (F C5). Since C5 is false everywhere, F C5 is false everywhere.

6. C7 = always C6 (G F C5). That requires C6 true at every state, but C6 is false, so C7 is false.

7. C8 = ¬C7, the negation of false, is therefore true.

Thus C8 is True."

- C5: ""C2 does not hold"" — true (same as C3).

- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — true, since C6 is valid regardless of state (it follows from C4 → C3).

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That asks whether at the next state C2 is true (i.e., whether event2 happens two steps ahead). False, since no events ever occur after event1.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This implication has a false antecedent (C1 is false), so the implication is vacuously true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 has happened initially, and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" so event1 will occur. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes event1 terminal.

- C1, C2, C3 (""Event1 eventually happens"") are true in the initial state (event1 will indeed occur).

- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false (because C3 is true). C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is therefore true. C6 (""C2 holds or C5 holds"") is true. C7 (""C1 holds or C6 holds"") is true — again, in the initial state.

- But once event1 occurs, no further events can happen. From a state after event1, the statement ""Event1 eventually happens"" (C1, C2, C3) is no longer true (there is no future occurrence), so C1–C3 become false; C4 becomes true, C5 false, C6 false, and thus C7 becomes false after event1.

- Therefore C7 is not true at all times, so ""C7 always holds"" (C8) is false, and consequently C9 (""C8 always holds"") is false.

So C9 is False."

Given facts:
- At the initial state S0, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from S0 onward, no events occur anywhere).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never happens).

Evaluate the conditions step by step (truth at all states unless noted):

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since no events can occur after S0, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false (at S0 and at every state).

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That would require event2 to happen two steps ahead; since event2 never occurs, C2 is false everywhere.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is true everywhere.

4. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true everywhere.

5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 holds at every state, C5 is true.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is a global truth, so C6 is true.

7. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is true at every state, so C7 is true.

8. C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" C7 is true at every state, so C8 is true at every state.

9. C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" Because C8 holds already at every state, it certainly holds at some future state — thus C9 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the context as discrete states with next-state obligations:
   - Initially (state s0): event1 is true.
   - After event1 (i.e. in the next state) event2 must hold.
   - After event2 (next state) event1 must hold.
   So the state sequence alternates: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

2. Evaluate the Ci formulas at s0 and successors:
   - C1 and C2 are both simply ""event1"" (redundant conjunction). So C1 and C2 hold at s0 (true), fail at s1.
   - C3 = not C2. Since C2 is false at s1, C3 is true at s1. Thus C3 does not hold at s0 but does hold at s1.
   - C4 = eventually C3. From s0 we reach s1 where C3 holds, so C4 is true (it eventually holds).
   - C5 = not C4. Since C4 is true, C5 is false at s0.
   - C6 = (C1 → C5). At s0, C1 is true and C5 is false, so C6 is false at s0.
   - C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" — at s0 we check C6 at s1. At s1, C1 is false (event1 false) and C5 is false, so C6 (false → false) is true at s1. Hence C7 is true at s0.
   - C8 = eventually C7. C7 already holds at s0, so C8 is true.
   - C9 = eventually C8. C8 holds at s0, so C9 is true.

Step-by-step reasoning

Context facts:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. In particular, once event2 has happened, no further events occur in later states.

Evaluate the conditions in the initial state and next states:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - Because event2 has happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur in the next state. So C1 is false.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds.""
   - C1 is already false, so ""always C1"" is false. Thus C2 is false.

3. C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens.""
   - event2 happens in the initial state, so the disjunction is true in the initial state. Thus C3 is true (initially).

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds.""
   - Since C3 already holds in the initial state, ""eventually C3"" is true. So C4 is true (initially).

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" (i.e., X C4)
   - In the next state no events occur (because event2 already happened), C2 remains false and event2 does not occur at that later state, so C3 will be false in that next state and at all subsequent states. Therefore ""eventually C3"" (C4) is false in the next state. So C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold.""
   - Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

7. C7: ""C6 does not hold.""
   - C6 is true, so C7 is false.

8. C8: ""C7 does not hold.""
   - C7 is false, so C8 is true.

9. C9: ""C8 does not hold.""
   - C8 is true, so C9 is false.

Conclusion: C9 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 occurs initially. After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 never occurs at any future time.
- C1 and C2 (""event2 eventually happens"") are therefore false.
- C3 (C1 and C2) is false.
- C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is vacuously true because its antecedent C3 is false.
- C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is also vacuously true because event2 never happens.
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state""): since C5 is true in every state (vacuously), C6 is true.
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds""): true (it already holds now).
- C8 (""C7 always holds""): true, because at every state the same reasoning applies.

- Initially event2 happened. The context says: after event2, event1 must happen — so in the initial state, event1 will happen in the next state. Thus C1 and C2 (both ""event1 happens in the next state"") are true in the initial state, so C3 (C1 and C2) is true in the initial state.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds."" But after event1 happens, no other events can happen, so in the state after event1 there is no next state (or the next-state proposition ""event1 happens in the next state"" is false). Therefore C3 does not hold in every state, so C4 is false.

- Initially (at the current/initial state) event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there are no later occurrences of any events after that initial state).
- (The statement about event2 is irrelevant because event2 does not occur in the initial state.)

Step 2 — expand the conditions:

- C2: event1 happens.
- C3: If C1 then C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same fact, C3 is true at the initial state.

- C8: If C6 holds then C7 holds (an implication).

Step 3 — evaluate truth values given the context:
- C1, C2, C3, C4 are true at the initial state.
- Because “after event1 no other events can happen,” there is no later occurrence of event1, so C5 (event1 in the next state) is false.
- Therefore C6 = C3 and C5 is false (since C5 is false).
- C7 is false (same as C5).
- C8 is the implication (C6 → C7). An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 occurs initially, then event2 must occur, then event1 must occur, and so on — so event2 does occur and event1 does occur (alternating), but event1 does not hold at every moment.

1. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false — event1 does not hold at times when event2 is the occurring event.
2. C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true — the implication is true because the antecedent C1 is false (or trivially, if event1 always happens then in particular event1 happens).
3. C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true — event1 does happen (initially) and C2 holds.
4. C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false — C3 includes ""event1 happens"", which is not true at times when event2 occurs, so C3 does not hold at all times.
5. C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens"") is true — event2 does occur (after event1), so the disjunction is true.
6. C6 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is the same as C3, so it is true.
7. C7 (""C5 holds or C6 holds"") is therefore true (both C5 and C6 are true).

Hence C7 is True."

- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

So in the actual execution: event1 occurred and event2 did not occur.

Now evaluate the conditions one by one:

1. C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
   - In the execution event1 did happen but event2 did not, so C1 is false.

2. C2: C1 does not hold.
   - Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

3. C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.
   - C2 is true, so the implication ""if event2 then C2"" is true (its consequent is true regardless of whether event2 occurs). Thus C3 is true.

4. C4: C3 always holds.
   - C3 is true now and depends only on the truth of C2 (which is a global fact about C1). Nothing in the trace makes C2/ C3 become false later, so C3 indeed holds at all times. Hence C4 is true.

5. C5: C4 always holds.
   - Same reasoning: C4 is a stable/global truth, so C5 is true.

6. C6: C5 always holds.
   - True for the same reason.

7. C7: C6 eventually holds.
   - If C6 always holds, then it certainly holds at some (in fact every) time; so C7 is true.

8. C8: C7 eventually holds.
   - C7 is true now, so ""eventually C7"" is true. Thus C8 is true.

9. C9: C8 eventually holds.
   - C8 is true now, so ""eventually C8"" is true. Thus C9 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- From ""initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event2 cannot occur at any time in this scenario. Thus event2 does not happen.

Evaluate conditions:
- C1 (event2 happens and event1 happens): false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens): false (C1 false).
- C3 (C2 always holds): false.
- C4 (C3 always holds): false.
- C5 (C4 eventually holds): false.
- C6 (C5 holds and event2 happens): false (both parts false).
- C7 (C6 does not hold): true (since C6 is false).
- C8 (event2 happens and event1 happens): false (same as C1).

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
  => In particular, since event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur later. That only restricts possible event traces, it does not force any of the logical conditions to be false.

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. This is a tautology (A -> A); it is always true (true whether or not event2 actually occurs).
- C2: C1 eventually holds. Since C1 is true now (a tautology), ""eventually C1"" is satisfied (it holds immediately), so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4 and C5: both are the same tautology as C1, so both hold (true).
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds. C4 and C5 are true, so the implication is true.
- C7: C3 holds or C6 holds. Both disjuncts are true, so C7 is true.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no later events occur. So ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (C1 and C5 true).
- C2 = (C1 or event2) is true. C3 = ""C2 in the next state"" is irrelevant because there is no next state after event2 (so it does not make C3 necessary).
- C4 = (event1 or C3) is false (event1 didn't happen and C3 doesn't hold).
- C6 = (C4 or C5) is true because C5 is true.
- C7 = (C6 or event2) is true.
- C8 = ""C7 always holds"" is true (C7 holds in the only state of the trace).

- We must decide whether C9 (""C8 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 ⇒ event1 holds and event1 is true after that).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 ⇒ event2 holds and event2 continues to be true).  
Thus event2 and event1 both occur (and the conditional ""if event2 then event1"" is true in this scenario).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" — True (matches the context).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (contradicts C1).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" — False (event1 is true but C2 is false, so the conjunction is false).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" — False (C3 is false, so it cannot always hold).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — False (since C4 is false).
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" — True (same as C1).
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" — True (an implication with a false antecedent C5 is vacuously true).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" — True (C7 is true).
- C9: ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" — C8 is true and event2 is true (from the context), so C9 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Despite the contradiction between C1 and C2, evaluating each statement against the context yields C9 true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 holds initially and the rules force alternation: after event2 comes event1, after event1 comes event2. So event1 does occur (indeed at the next state), and in fact occurs infinitely often. Therefore C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is True.

- C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is then True (because C1 is True). So C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is False, and consequently C4 (""C3 always holds"") and C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") are False at the initial state.

- C6 (""Event1 happens or C5 holds"") may be False initially (event1 does not hold at the initial state), but at any state where event1 happens the disjunction becomes True.

- Note that at any state where event1 happens:
  - C6 holds (because ""event1 happens"" makes the disjunction true),
  - hence C7 (""C6 holds and event1 happens"") holds,
  - and C8 (""C7 holds and event1 happens"") also holds.

  Thus C8 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" at a given state.

- Therefore C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is equivalent to ""event1 eventually happens"" (which is C1). Since C1 is True, C9 is True."

- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event1, event2 must occur (so at the next state after the initial state, event2 happens).

We need the truth of C8, which asserts ""C7 holds in the next state."" So evaluate C7 in the state immediately after the initial state (the state where event2 happens).

Evaluate the relevant Ci in that next state:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True in the next state because after event2, event1 will happen (so event1 does eventually happen).
- C2: same as C1, so True.

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is false at the initial moment, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"" — C4 does hold and event1 does happen (initially), so the implication C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds"" — C3 is true (C6 is false), so the disjunction is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore there are no future events after the initial state, so event1 never happens at any point. So C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is false.

- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false: either there is no next state (so X formulas are false) or, if you consider a next state, from that state event1 still never happens, so C1 is false there.

- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true because C2 is false.

- C4 is the same as C1, so false. C5 is the same as C2, so false. Hence C6 (C4 and C5) is false, and C7 (C6 in the next state) is false.

- Finally C8 is ""C3 holds or C7 holds"". Since C3 is true, C8 is true."

- C3 is the same as C2, so it is also always true.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state. Since C3 is always true, C4 is true whenever we consider the next state.

1) Interpret the context as an execution trace of states:
- s0 (initial): event1 happens.
- Because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", in the next state s1 event2 happens.
- Because ""after event2, no other events can happen"", any state after s1 (call it s2, s3, ...) has no events.

2) Simplify the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ event2.
- C2: X C1 ≡ X(event2) (C1 holds in the next state).
- C3: X C1 (same as C2).
- C4: ¬C3 ≡ ¬X(event2).
- C5: event1 ∧ C4 ≡ event1 ∧ ¬X(event2).
- C6: event1 ∨ C5 ≡ event1 (because A ∨ (A ∧ B) = A).
- C7: C2 ∨ C6 ≡ X(event2) ∨ event1.
- C8: always C7 (globally X(event2) ∨ event1).

3) Evaluate C7 at each state:
- At s0: event1 is true, so C7 is true.
- At s1: event2 is true at s1, but X(event2) at s1 asks whether event2 holds at s2 — it does not (no events after s1). event1 is false at s1. So C7 is false at s1.
- Because C7 is false at s1, it is not true in all states.

Therefore C8 (""C7 always holds"") is False.

- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- The system forces alternation: after event2 there will be event1, and after event1 there will be event2. So the trace is s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, … (alternating forever).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at s0
- C1: ""event1 eventually happens"" — true (event1 occurs at s1).
- C2: ""event2 happens or C1 holds"" — true at s0 because event2 happens at s0.
- C3: same as C2 — true.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" — true at s0 (C3 true and event2 happens at s0).
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds"" — true at s0.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — true, since C5 already holds at s0 (so it holds eventually).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — true, since C6 holds now (so it holds eventually).
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — we must check C7 at s1.

Step 3 — check C7 at s1
At s1 (event1):
- C1: event1 eventually happens — true (it holds now and again later).
- C2, C3: true (C1 holds).
- C4: C3 and event2 happens — false at s1 because event2 does not happen at s1.
- C5: false at s1 (since C4 is false).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — true at s1 because C5 holds at s2 (event2 at s2 makes C4 and hence C5 true).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — true at s1 because C6 already holds at s1.

So C7 is true at s1.

Step 4 — conclusion
C7 holds in the next state (s1), so C8 is true.

- Let S0 be the initial state (event2 just happened). By ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 occurs in the next state S1. So C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is true at S0.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. it asserts C1 is true at S1. But at S1 event1 has already happened, and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so event1 does not happen in S2. Therefore C1 is false at S1, so C2 is false at S0.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") and C6 (""C2 holds in the next state"") are the same claim; both assert C2 is true at S1, which we already found false. So C3 and C6 are false.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 never becomes true in any future state.

So a possible state sequence is s0: event2, s1: event1, s2+: no events.

- C3: same as C2.
- C4: (if C2 then C3) = (if C1(s+1) then C1(s+1)) — this is a tautology, true in every state.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpretations (from the context)
- S0 (initial): event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → S1 must have event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from S1 onward no events occur.

2. Evaluate conditions at states
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" In S0 the next state S1 has event1, not event2 → C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1 → false in S0.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" In S0 event2 does happen but C2 is false there → C3 is false in S0.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C1 is false, C4 is vacuously true in S0.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" C4 is true (or event2 happens in S0 anyway), so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Same as C3, false in S0.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" After S0, we reach S1 where event2 does not happen, so the implication in C6 is vacuously true in S1. Hence C6 holds at S1, so C6 eventually holds → C7 is true.

Examine the context and consequences:
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial state event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Because event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur at any later state.
- Therefore there will be a (next) state where event1 does not hold (a state with no events). So there exists a future state in which ""event1 does not happen"" is true.

Now evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false at the initial state, but true at a subsequent state (as just argued).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — true (there is a future state where C1 holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — false (because C2 is true).
- C4 and C5: ""C3 holds in the next state."" — false (C3 is false now and remains false in the next state).

C7 is the statement: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" We must decide whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will inevitably occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (follows from “after event1, event2 must happen”).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" True — the next state is still after event1, so event2 will still eventually happen there.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" True (C2 is true, so the disjunction is true).
- C4: same as C3, so True.
- C5: same as C1, so True.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" True (antecedent true and consequent true → implication true).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event1 occurs, and after event1 event2 must occur at some later time. After event2, no further events occur.
- C1 = (event1 or event2). C2 asserts C1 always holds (i.e., at every moment either event1 or event2 happens).
- Given the context, once event2 happens there are no further events, so at times after event2 neither event1 nor event2 occur, making C1 false after event2.
- But event2 must occur (since event1 occurred initially). Therefore C1 cannot hold at all times; C2 is impossible under the context (C2 is false in every model of the context).
- An implication (C2 -> C7) is true whenever the antecedent C2 is impossible (vacuously true). Hence C8 holds under the context.

Reasoning step by step:

1. From the context: event2 happens initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never happens on this execution.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is false (event1 never happens).

3. C2 = ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is already true at the start and remains true, so C3 is true.

5. C4 = ""C3 always holds."" C3 holds now and at all (remaining) states, so C4 is true.

6. C5 = ""C4 holds and event1 happens."" C4 is true but event1 does not happen, so C5 is false.

7. C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial event2 (no further events), so C6 is false.

8. C7 = ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is false and will never become true, so C7 is false.

9. C8 = ""If event2 happens, then C7 holds."" Event2 does happen, but C7 is false, so the implication is false; C8 does not hold.

Reasoning step by step:

1. From the context: event2 happens initially and after event2 no other events can happen. So every possible execution/trace contains event2 (and then stops). Therefore the claim ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. event2 occurs in every execution) is true. So C1, C2, C4, C6 (all the same claim) are all true.

2. C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same true proposition, C3 is true (indeed it is a trivial implication true here).

3. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is true already, so ""eventually C4"" is true as well (since C4 holds immediately).

4. C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" We already have C6 true (and C5 true), so C7 is true.

5. C8: ""If event2 happens, then C7 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), and C7 is true, so C8 is true.

6. C9: ""If C3 holds, then C8 holds."" We have shown C3 is true and C8 is true, so the implication C3 -> C8 is true.

Thus C9 is True."

From the context:
- event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen.

Evaluate the Ci under event2 = True and event1 = True:
- C1 (event2 does not happen) is false.
- C2 (if event1 then C1): since event1 is true, C2 is equivalent to C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 is identical to C2, so false.
- C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is false.
- C5 (if C4 then event2): antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is true.

- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Also after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 never occurs here.)

Step 2 — evaluate the named claims
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C7: ""C6 holds in the next state.""
- Because event2 occurred and no other events can happen after it, there is no successor (no next state) to the current state. In standard temporal semantics, a ""next"" formula is false at a state that has no next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context:
   - At time 0: event2 happened (initially).
   - “After event2, event1 must happen” ⇒ at time 1, event1 happens.
   - “After event1, no other events can happen” ⇒ at time 2 and later, no events occur.

2. Evaluate the Ci’s (at the initial state/time 0, unless otherwise noted):
   - C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” At time 1 event1 happens, not event2, so C1 is false.
   - C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” At time 1 event1 does happen, but C1 is false at time 1, so C2 is false (it fails when event1 occurs).
   - C3: “C2 always holds.” Since C2 fails at time 1, C3 is false.
   - C4: same as C3, so false.
   - C5: “C4 holds or event1 happens.” At time 0, event1 does not happen, but at time 1 event1 does — so C5 can be true at time 1. In particular, at time 0 we care about whether C5 holds now or later as used below; more directly:
   - C6: “C5 holds or event2 happens.” At time 0 event2 happened, so C6 is true at the initial state.
   - C7: “C3 holds or C6 holds.” C3 is false, but C6 is true (already true at the initial state), therefore C7 is true.

Thus C7 evaluates to True."

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must determine whether C8 (""If C6 holds, then C7 holds"") is true, given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — Use the context
- event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 happens).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Not needed for these condition evaluations beyond confirming event2 occurs.)

Because the context forces event2 to happen, event2 is true.

Step 3 — Evaluate conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (implication of a fact to itself). C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 holds unconditionally, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Both are true (C2 true, event1 happened), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: same form as C1, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both hold, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 holds, so C7 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C8
- C8: ""If C6 holds, then C7 holds."" We have C6 true and C7 true, so the implication is true.

- C4 is ""event1 happens and C3"" — C3 is true but event1 does not happen, so C4 is false.
- C5 is ""event2 happens and C4"" — C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6 is ""C2 and C5"" — C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7 is ""C6 always holds"" — since C6 is false, C7 is false.
- C8 is ""If event1 happens, then C7 holds"" — the antecedent (event1 happens) is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 is true.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — not needed to decide C9.
- C2 = (C1 or event1). Since event1 is true initially, C2 is true.
- C3 = C2 and event1. With C2 and event1 true, C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"". Because C3 already holds now, C4 is true.
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" is therefore false.
- C6 = ""C5 always holds"" is false (C5 is already false).
- C7 = ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens"" is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C8 = ""If event1 happens, then C7 holds"". Event1 holds in the initial state and C7 is true, so C8 is true in the initial state.

Now consider the next state:
- Whether or not event2 occurs in the next state (the premises force event2 to occur eventually, and if it occurs then no further events happen), in the next state either event1 does not hold (making the antecedent of C8 false, so C8 true vacuously) or event1 does hold and C7 still holds (C7 is true as shown). In every case C8 is true in the next state.

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C7.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So event1 cannot happen after the initial event2.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 does not occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" In the initial state event2 does happen, but event1 does not (it cannot occur after event2). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already false in the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 → false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is false, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" C4 is true, so C5 is true (regardless of event1).
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" C2 is false and C5 is true, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" No events can happen after the initial state, so truth values persist and C6 remains false in the next state; hence C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication that is true in any state).
- Since C1 is true in every state, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true in every state that has a next state; given the context (“after event2, no other events can happen”), either there is a next state with no events (in which case C1 is still true there) or the execution stops (in which case X-operators are vacuously handled as described below). In either interpretation C2 holds at the initial point.
- C3 is the same as C2, so it also holds.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") holds because C3 holds everywhere.
- C5 (""C4 always holds"") therefore holds.
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false (since C5 holds).
- C7 (""C2 holds or C6 holds"") is true because C2 holds.
- C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true because C7 holds in all states.

</graphml>",1.0,"Assume ""after X"" means ""in the next state after X"". From the context:

- state0: event1 holds (given).
- Because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", state1: event2 holds.
- Then ""after event2, event1 must happen"" gives state2: event1, and so on; events alternate each step (state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, ...).

Now evaluate the Cs at state0 (unless stated ""in the next state""):

- C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just event2. At state0 this is false (event2 does not happen at state0).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at state1 event2 does hold, so C2 is true at state0.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — this is C2 -> event2 at the current state (state0). C2 is true but event2 is false at state0, so C3 is false at state0.
- C4: same as C2, so true at state0.
- C5: C3 and C4 → false (since C3 false).
- C6: C5 or event1 happens → event1 is true at state0, so C6 is true at state0.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" → false at state0 (because C6 holds).
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — we must check C7 at state1.

Evaluate C7 at state1:

- At state1: event2 is true, event1 false.
- C1 at state1 (event2) is true.
- C2 at state1: C1 holds in next state → at state2 event2 is false (event1 at state2), so C2 is false at state1.
- C3 at state1: C2 -> event2 is vacuously true (C2 false).
- C4 at state1: same as C2, false.
- C5 at state1: C3 and C4 → false.
- C6 at state1: C5 or event1 → event1 is false at state1, so C6 false.
- C7 at state1: ""C6 does not hold"" → true (since C6 false at state1).

Context summary:
- At the initial state (state 0), event1 occurred.
- After any occurrence of event1, no other events can happen later (so in states after that occurrence, event2 and any other different events are forbidden).
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur later (this is vacuous here if event2 never occurs).

Show a counterexample timeline consistent with the context:
- state 0: event1 happens (given).
- state 1: no events happen.
- state 2, state 3, ...: no events happen.

This timeline satisfies the context: after event1 (state 0) no other events occur in future states; event2 never occurs, so the ""after event2, event1 must happen"" constraint is vacuously satisfied.

Now evaluate the hypothesis components on this timeline:
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false at state 0 because at state 1 no events occur.
- Since C9 requires C1 to hold, C9 is false in this model.

Therefore C9 is not guaranteed by the context.

- C2: same as C1 — True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" — True (C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — False (C3 holds).

Reasoning (step-by-step, assuming events are instantaneous truths that do not automatically persist):

1. Initially event1 happened, so at the initial state event1 = true and event2 = false.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" implies in all future states neither event1 nor event2 will occur again.
3. C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" is true at the initial state (because event1 happened). C2 is the same, so also true initially. Thus C3 (C1 and C2) is true at the initial state.
4. C4: ""C3 always holds"" requires C3 to be true at every future state. But in the next (and all later) states no events happen, so neither event1 nor event2 holds there; therefore C1 and C2 are false in those future states and C3 is false. Hence C4 is false.
5. If C4 is never true, C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false, so C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false, and all subsequent conditions C7, C8, C9 are false as well.

Therefore C9 is False."

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 is true; after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 never happens.
- C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false.
- C2 (C1 or event1) is true because event1 is true.
- C3 and C5 (both: if C2 then event2) are false because C2 is true but event2 never occurs.
- C4 (if event2 then C3) is true vacuously (event2 is false).
- C6 = C4 or C5 is true (C4 true).
- Since no events can occur after the initial state, truth values don't change in the next state; C6 still holds there.
Therefore C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication and therefore holds in the given situation (event2 did happen initially, so the implication is true).

2. C2, C3, C4 each say ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 does hold and event2 did in fact happen (initially), each of C2, C3 and C4 is true.

3. C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since C3 and C4 are true, C5 is true.

4. C6 is ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" With both C2 and C5 true, C6 is true.

5. C7 says ""C6 always holds."" Given the context that event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, the truth values of C1–C6 cannot be overturned later—C6 remains true at all times in this timeline. Therefore C7 is true."

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Understand the context:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once we are in the initial state (where event1 has happened) there will be no occurrence of any event thereafter.
- Therefore event2 can never occur in any future state.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True, because event2 can never occur given the context.
- C2, C3, C5: each is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now and continues to hold (event2 never happens), these are true in the current state and in every future state.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is trivially true because C2 and C3 are the same statement (both true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because C5 holds in every state (C1 never happens anywhere), it also holds in the next state — so C6 is true.

3. C7: ""If C4 holds, then C6 holds."" Since C4 is true and C6 is true, the implication is true.

Therefore C7 is True."

Step 2 — what the context says
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"", but event2 cannot occur because it would be after event1.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""at every moment/state,"" event1 only occurs initially and does not reoccur at later times, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen initially, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 and C4 are the same as C2, so they are false.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts false, so C6 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
   - At the initial state event1 has happened.
   - After event1 no other events can happen (so no event2 can occur at or after the initial state).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 does not occur).

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — after event1 no further events happen, so event1 does not occur in the next state.
   - C2: ""Event2 happens or C1."" Both disjuncts false (event2 does not happen, C1 is false), so C2 is false.
   - C3: same as C2, so false.
   - C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is false but event1 did happen initially, so C4 is true.
   - C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 is false, so C5 is false.
   - C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is already false at the initial state, so C6 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That is false, because after the initial event1 no events happen in the next state.

1. From the context, event1 occurs initially. Also, after event1 no other events can happen, so no event can occur after that initial occurrence (in particular, event2 cannot occur at any time).

2. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True — it already happened initially.

3. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True — C1 is true, so the implication holds regardless of whether event1 happens again.

4. C3 and C4: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Both are true (event1 occurred and C2 holds), so C3 and C4 are true.

5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True — C4 already holds, so it eventually holds.

6. C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" True.

7. C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" C6 holds, so the disjunction is true (and event2 does not need to happen).

Therefore C7 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C2 (C1 and event2) requires event2 to happen; but event2 cannot occur under the context, so C2 is false in all possible traces.
- C7 (eventually C6) is irrelevant because its antecedent conditions require event2 as well and thus cannot become true.

Reasoning:

- C1 (event1 or event2) is true in any state because one of those events occurs at each state.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true at the initial state because at the next state event1 occurs, so C1 is true there.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true at the initial state because C2 already holds at the next state (hence eventually).
- C4 is the same as C3, so also true.
- C5 (""event1 happens and C4 holds"") is false at the initial state because event1 does not happen in the initial state (event2 does).
- C6 depends on C5 and is therefore false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Also: after event2, no other events can happen, but event2 never happens because event1 already happened initially.)

Evaluate conditions step by step:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — since event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, it does not happen in the next state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False — C1 is not true at the initial state, so it does not always hold.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True — C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False — C3 is true, so its negation is false.
- C5: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — same as C1.

- C7: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — same as C1/C5.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" False — both disjuncts are false.

Evaluate conditions in State0:

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In State0, event1 does not happen, so the implication is true (vacuously).

Context (interpreted temporally):
- At time 0: event1 happens.

- After event2, event1 must happen (so time2: event1).
Thus the sequence is event1, event2, event1, event2, ... forever.

Evaluate the conditions under this sequence:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. at every state). This is false because event2 does not hold in the event1 states.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — false (C1 is false).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false in states where event2 happens, and vacuously true in states where event2 does not happen. So C3 holds at event1 states, fails at event2 states.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" For an event2 state, the next state is event1 where C3 holds, so C4 is true at event2 states. For an event1 state, the next is event2 where C3 fails, so C4 is false at event1 states.
- C5: ""Eventually C4 holds."" Starting at time0 (event1), at time1 (event2) C4 holds, so C5 is true.
- C6: same as C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" As above, this is false at event2 states (because C2 is false), so C6 is false in the system.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happens (initially), and consequently event2 happens sometime after that. So both event1 and event2 occur (at least once).

- C1 = ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" — true (redundant conjunction, event1 does happen).
- C5 = same as C1 — true.
- C2 = C1 and event2 happens — true (both event1 and event2 occur).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" — irrelevant for the final result, but even if uncertain, we don't need it.
- C4 = ""If C3 then event1 happens"" — true (an implication whose consequent, event1, is true anyway).
- C6 = C4 or C5 — true because C5 is true.
- C7 = C6 does not hold — false (negation of a true statement).
- C8 = ""C7 always holds"" — false because C7 is false.
- C9 = ""C8 always holds"" — false because C8 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has happened, no event (including event2) can occur at any future time.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time in the timeline (there is no opportunity for event2 to happen).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition

- C2: same as C1, so False.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Both parts are true in the initial state → C2 is True (at the initial state).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initial state has event1. The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an infinite alternating trace: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ...

- C1 = (event1 and event1) ≡ event1. So C1 is true exactly in the event1 states (state0, state2, ...). Same for C2.  
- C3 = C1 and C2 ≡ event1, so C3 holds in the same even states only.  
- C4 = always C3 asserts C3 in every state; that fails because C3 is false in the event2 states (odd states). Thus C4 is false (already false at the initial state).  
- C5 = next C4 is false (since C4 is false in all states).  
- C6 = next C5 is false.  
- C7 = always C6 is false.  
- C8 = eventually C7 is false (C7 never becomes true).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context fixes the situation: event2 has already happened initially, and after that no further events can occur. So the truth values of these claims are determined immediately and cannot change later.

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event2 has happened in the initial (and only) reachable state, C1 is true.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in the actual situation and nothing can change it, C2 is true.

4. C3 and C4: both are ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, these are both false.

5. C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 is false and there are no future changes, so C6 is false.

- Given the alternating-event context (initially event1, then event2 must follow, then event1 must follow, etc.), evaluate whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is true under the hypothesis chain C1..C9.

Interpretation of temporal operators
- ""always"" = globally (G).
- ""next state"" = X.
- ""eventually"" = F.
- Evaluate properties at each time point along the infinite alternation trace: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ...

Evaluate conditions step by step
1. C1 = event1 and event1, i.e. C1 is true exactly at states where event1 happens (true at even times t0, t2, ...).
2. C2 = C1 always (G C1). This requires event1 at every state. On the alternating trace event1 is false at t1, t3, ... so C2 is false at every time.
3. C3 = X C2. Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is false everywhere.
4. C4 = (event2 -> C3). With C3 false everywhere, C4 is equivalent to ¬event2; so C4 is true exactly at event1 states (even times) and false at event2 states (odd times).
5. C5 = X C4. Thus C5 at time t equals C4 at t+1. Because C4 is true at even times and false at odd times, C5 is true at odd times and false at even times.
6. C6 = C5 and event1. C5 true only at odd times, event1 only at even times, so they never coincide → C6 is false everywhere.
7. C7 = X C6. Since C6 is false everywhere, C7 is false everywhere.
8. C8 = always C7 (G C7). With C7 false somewhere (indeed everywhere), C8 is false everywhere.
9. C9 = eventually C8 (F C8). Since C8 is false at every time, there is no future time where C8 holds, so C9 is false.

False"

Reasoning (step by step):

- System trace (minimal): time 0: event1 happens; time 1: event2 happens (must follow); time 2+: no events (terminal).
- C1 / C2: ""event1 eventually happens"" — true at time 0 (event1 happens there), but false at times ≥1 because event1 will not happen again.
- C3 / C5: ""C2 always holds"" (G C2) — false, because at time 1 (and later) C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3) — false, since C3 is false at time 1.
- C6: C4 or C5 — false (both disjuncts false).
- C7: C1 or C6 — at time 0 this is true (C1 true), but at time 1 both C1 and C6 are false, so C7 is false at time 1.
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" (G C7) — false, because C7 does not hold at time 1.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   Thus the system forces an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, … So both event1 and event2 do occur (indeed infinitely often).

2. Evaluate C1–C5:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the alternation, this disjunction is true.
   - C2 and C3 are the same as C1, so they are true.
   - C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Since C3 holds, C4 holds.
   - C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 holds.

3. C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds."" We have C1 and C5 true, so this implication is true (and, given the premises, it holds whenever checked).

4. C7: ""C6 always holds."" Given the facts above (the premises make C6 true whenever evaluated), C7 holds.

5. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This contradicts C7, so C8 is false.

6. C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" Since C8 is false (it does not hold and cannot become true without contradicting established facts), C9 is false.

False"

- We must determine the truth value of C9 (""C8 does not hold"") given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C9.

Step 2 — use the context to evaluate event1
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen (doesn't prevent event1 itself from happening).
- Therefore event1 happens in all runs consistent with the context; i.e., ""event1 always happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" → True.
- C2: same as C1 → True.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" → True (C2 holds).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" → True (antecedent true and event1 does happen).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" → True.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" → True (C5 is a true global fact under the context).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" → True.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" → False (because C7 holds).
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" → True (negation of false is true).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

3. C2: (If C1 holds then event2 happens). Since C1 holds, event2 happens — so C2 holds (and event2 is true; it was already true initially).
4. C4 is the same as C2; C5: (If C3 holds then C4 holds). With C3 true, C4 holds. So C4 and C5 hold.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context we have the sequence: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; and after event1 no further events can occur. So both event2 and (later) event1 happen.

2. Evaluate the Ci in the current (initial) state:
   - C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — True (event2 already happened and event1 must happen).
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — True (C1 is true and event1 does happen).
   - C3: same as C1 — True.
   - C4: same as C2 — True.
   - C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — True (both hold).
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — False.
   - C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds"" — False (C6 is false).

3. C8 says ""C7 holds in the next state."" The next state is the state after event2, where event1 has occurred. Re-evaluating C7 there:
   - C2 is still true in that state.
   - C6 is still false because C5 (C3 or C4) remains true.
   - Hence C7 is false in the next state.

Therefore C8 is False."

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Evaluate the conditions step by step:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"". True, because event1 does occur.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since event1 occurs after event2, C1 becomes true at that time, so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C1, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — both true, so C6 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- What is asked: C7 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the listed conditions.
- Identify redundancies: C1 and C4 both say ""Event1 does not happen"" (same claim). C3 and C5 are the same conditional (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens""). C6 is the conjunction ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" (i.e. C4 ∧ C5).
- From the hypothesis list, C4 and C5 are explicitly asserted, so C6 is true (it is stated as C6 as well).
- If the consequent of an implication (C6) is already true, then the implication (C3 → C6) is true regardless of whether C3 holds (material implication).
- Note: the context contradicts C1/C4 (context says event1 happened initially), so the overall theory is inconsistent, but that does not change that C6 is asserted in the hypothesis and therefore C7 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 is true in the initial state, and once event2 has happened no further events can happen. Therefore event1 can never occur in any state (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and there is no earlier state to place it).

- C1: ""event1 eventually happens"" — false (event1 never happens).
- C4: same as C1 — false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens (now)"" — this implication is vacuously true in the current state because C1 is false. So C2 is true now.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — true, since C2 already holds now.
- C5: ""C3 or C4"" — true because C3 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — true (C5 holds now).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — true: in the next state C1 is still false, so C2 is still vacuously true there, hence C3, C5, C6 hold in the next state as well.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds"" — true (C7 already holds).
- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — false, because C8 does hold.

Thus C9 is False."

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So no event2 can ever occur after the initial event1.)
- (Also: after event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

Step-by-step evaluation:
1. Since event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 never happens in any state.
2. C1 (""Event2 happens and event2 happens"") is false (event2 does not happen).
3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (C1 is false and there are no further states where it could become true).
4. C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false (C2 will never hold).
5. C4 (same as C1) is false.
6. C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true, because its antecedent C3 is false (implication with false antecedent is true).
7. C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false (since C5 does hold).
8. C7 (""Event1 happens and C6 holds"") is false (event1 is true but C6 is false, so the conjunction is false).
9. C8 (same as C1) is false.
10. C9 (""C7 holds and C8 holds"") is false (both conjuncts are false).

Reasoning (step by step):

1. C1 and C2: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" These implications are tautologically true (p → p), and additionally event1 did happen initially, so C1 and C2 hold.

2. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" C2 does hold, so C3 requires that event2 happens. But the context says: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen (it cannot occur after the initial event1). So C3 is false.

3. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is false (and cannot be made true later because event2 cannot occur), C4 is false.

4. C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" C1 holds, so C5 is true.

5. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" Because C5 holds, C6 requires event1 happens. Event1 already happened initially, so C6 holds.

6. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 holds now, so ""eventually"" it holds — C7 is true.

7. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" But C7 does hold, so C8 is false.

8. C9: ""C8 always holds."" C8 is false (already false now), so it cannot always hold. Therefore C9 is false.

- The context says initially event2 happened. So at the initial state event2 is true.
- The context also says ""after event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 already happened initially, no event1 can occur at any later point; in particular event1 never happens.
- C1 = (event2 and event2) is true at the initial state (redundant conjunction of event2).
- C7 is the same as C1, so C7 is also true at the initial state. Therefore C8 = (C6 or C7) is true (because C7 is true).
- C9 requires (event1 happens) and C8 holds. Although C8 holds, event1 never happens (because event2 has already occurred and prevents any further events). Thus the conjunction in C9 is false.

- State S0 (initial): event2 happens, event1 does not yet.
- State S1 (after S0): event1 happens, and after event1 no other events can happen (so no further states with events).
Thus at S0: (event2 = true, event1 = false). At S1: (event1 = true, event2 = false).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition at the initial state S0
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" At S0 this is false (event1 is false at S0).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks if C1 is true at S1. At S1 both event2 and event1 are not simultaneously true (event2 is false at S1), so C1 is false at S1 ⇒ C2 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Let S0 be the initial state. In S0 event1 happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes S0 terminal (no successor).

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In S0 event1 happened but event2 does not, so C1 is false in S0.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" With S0 terminal, the only chance is now; C1 is false now, so C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true in S0.

5. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (S0 is terminal), so a next-state formula is false. Thus C4 is false.

6. By the same reasoning, C5, C6, and C7 (each saying the previous holds in the next state) are all false.

7. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true in S0.

8. C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" There is no next state, so this is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

- After event1, event2 must happen.

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no events can happen afterward, event1 does not always happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is never true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is false, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" C6 is true and event2 did happen initially, so the implication (C7) is true.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds (hence it holds eventually).  
- C3 is the same as C1, so it holds. Thus C4 (C2 and C3) holds.  
- Since C4 holds now and continues to hold in every state (the relationships are structural facts about events), C5 (C4 in the next state), C6 (always C5), C7 (C6 in the next state) and C8 (always C7) all hold by straightforward propagation.

- C3 and C4 are identical: both say ""C2 holds in the next state."" So C5 = C3 or C4 simplifies to ""C2 holds in the next state"" (next(C2)).

- C6 says C5 always holds, i.e. in every state next(C2) holds.

- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. That makes the initial state a terminal state with no next state.

- In a terminal state there is no successor state, so ""next(C2)"" is false there. Hence C5 is false in the initial state, so C6 (""always next(C2)"") is false.

- C7 is the negation of C6 (""C6 does not hold""), so C7 is true."

Interpretation and timeline
- Read temporally: ""always"" = globally, ""eventually"" = at some future point, ""holds in the next state"" = in the immediate successor state.
- States:
  - State0 (initial): event1 happened.
  - State1 (next): event2 must happen (so event2 holds in state1).
  - After state1: no other events can happen (so event2 does not necessarily hold forever after state1).

Evaluate each condition at the initial state:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (G event2). False — event2 is not true in state0 and does not hold at all future states.
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2). False — there is no future point from which G event2 becomes true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). False — C3 is false in state1.
- C5: same as C1/C2, so False.
- C6: ""C4 or C5"". False or False = False.
- C7: ""C1 and C6"". False and False = False.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" (X C7). False — C7 is false in state1.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" (¬C8). Since C8 is false, C9 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and whenever event2 happens event1 must happen afterward, and whenever event1 happens event2 must happen afterward. This enforces that event1 does eventually occur (indeed event1 occurs repeatedly thereafter).
- C1, C2, C5 (each: ""Event1 eventually happens"") are true.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false because C2 is true.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is therefore false (a false proposition cannot become true later here).
- C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is false because C4 is false.
- C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C8 (""C1 holds and C7 holds"") is false (C7 is false).
- C9 (""C8 always holds"") is false because C8 is already false.

Context summary
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After event1 must happen event2, and after event2 must happen event1. So states alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … Event1 occurs infinitely often (and from every state, event1 will occur again).

Evaluate the conditions step by step
- C1, C2, C3: “Event1 eventually happens.” Given the alternating sequence, event1 does occur again from every state, so these are true in every state.
- C4: C2 or C3. Since both C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true (in every state).
- C5: C4 does not hold. This is the negation of a true statement, so C5 is false (in every state).
- C6: C5 holds in the next state. Because C5 is false in every state, C6 is false.
- C7: C1 holds and C6 holds. C1 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: C7 always holds. Since C7 is false (already at the initial state), C8 is false.
- C9: C8 holds in the next state. C8 is false in every state, so C9 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs in the next state). After event2, no other events can happen.

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false in the initial state (since event1 did happen).

- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This is a tautology per state (either event1 happens or it does not), so C2 is true in every state. In the initial state it is true because event1 happens.

- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true.

- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" In the next state (after the initial state) C2 is still true (C2 is per-state tautology), so C4 holds there; thus C5 is true.

- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" C5 is true, and from the context we know event2 does indeed happen after event1 (in that next state), so the implication is satisfied; C6 is true.

- C4 = “C3 eventually holds” = “event2 holds at some current or future state.”
- C5 = “If C2 holds then C4 holds.” Given C2 is “event2 holds,” whenever C2 is true C4 is also true immediately (event2 holds now ⇒ event2 holds eventually); when C2 is false the implication is vacuously true. So C5 is true at every state.
- C6 = “C5 does not hold.” Since C5 holds at every state, C6 is false at every state.
- C7 = “C6 holds in the next state.” Because C6 is false everywhere, C7 is false everywhere.
- C8 = “C7 holds in the next state.” Because C7 is false everywhere, C8 is false everywhere.
- C9 = “C1 holds or C8 holds.” Thus at a state C9 is true iff C1 (i.e., event2) holds at that state (because C8 is always false).

Step 4 — evaluate C9 at the initial state
- At state 0 (initial) event2 is false, so C1 is false and C8 is false ⇒ C9 is false at the initial state.

Reasoning (step by step):
- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen. So event2 never occurs at any future state.
- C1 and C2 (""event1 happens and event2 happens"") are both false (event2 never happens).
- C3 (C1 or C2) is false.
- C4 (eventually C3) is false because C3 never becomes true.
- C5 (C4 holds in the next state) is false (C4 is false in every state; if there is no next state, ""next"" is false).
- C6 (C5 holds in the next state) is false.
- C7 (not C6) is therefore true (since C6 is false).
- C8 (always C7) is true: C7 holds in the initial state and will hold in every state (there are no states where C6 becomes true), so G C7 holds.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (i.e. the initial state is terminal — there is no next state).
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Evaluate the conditions step by step (truth values are at the initial state):

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false — event1 cannot happen because event2 already happened and no further events can occur.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" Same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is C2 → C3. C2 is true and C3 is false, so the implication is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so the next-state formula is false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since there is no future beyond the initial state and C5 is false now, ""eventually C5"" is false.
- C7: ""Event1 happens and C6 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point after the initial event1).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" True — event1 happened initially, so any occurrence of event2 necessarily follows that initial event1.

3. C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True — event1 does happen (initially), and C1 also holds, so the disjunction is true.

4. C3 / C6: ""C2 holds in the next state."" True — C1 is a general implication that holds in all states, so even if event1 doesn't hold in the next state, C1 does, making C2 true in the next state. Thus both C3 and C6 are true.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds (in the next state), so it holds eventually.

6. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False — C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

7. C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Set up the timeline from the context:
   - s0 (initial): event1 happened, event2 not yet.
   - s1 (next): event2 must happen → event2 is true in s1.
   - s2 (after event2): no other events can happen → event1 and event2 are false in s2 (and beyond).

2. Interpret each Ci at s0 (X φ means “φ in the next state”):
   - C1 = X(event2). At s0, event2 is true in s1 → C1(s0) = True.
   - C2 = C1 OR event2. At s0, C1 is True → C2(s0) = True.
   - C3 = X(C2). Need C2 at s1: event2 is true at s1, so C2(s1) = True → C3(s0) = True.
   - C4 = not C3. Since C3(s0) = True → C4(s0) = False.
   - C5 = X(C4). Need C4 at s1: C4(s1) = not C3(s1). C3(s1) = X(C2) at s1 = C2(s2). At s2 event2 is false and C1 at s2 is false, so C2(s2) = False → C3(s1)=False → C4(s1)=True. Thus C5(s0) = True.
   - C6 = C1 OR event2. Same as C2 → C6(s0) = True.
   - C7 = C5 OR C6. Both are True → C7(s0) = True.

Interpretation of context:
- At time 0, event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later step).
- Rule B: After event1, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From that, the only possible run consistent with the context is: time0: event2; time1: event1; no events after time1.

Now evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false: event2 happens at time0 but does not happen at time1 or afterwards (because event1 occurs and is terminal). So C1 is false.

- C2 and C3: both are ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false.

- C4: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Model the behaviour as a sequence of states: s0, s1, s2, ...
  - s0: event1 happens (given).
  - By the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the sequence alternates: s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, etc.

- Evaluate the Ci's at (for example) the initial state s0, using this sequence:

  - C1 and C2 and C5: ""Event1 always happens"" — false, because event1 is false in s1 (it only holds on every other state).
  - C3 = C1 or C2 — false (both C1 and C2 are false).
  - C4 = always C3 — false (C3 is false).
  - C6 = (if C5 holds, then event1 happens). Since C5 is false, the implication is true (false => anything is true). So C6 is true (indeed true in every state because C5 is never true).
  - C7 = C4 or C6 — true (C6 is true).
  - C8 = ""C7 holds in the next state"" — true, because C7 is true in every state (so in the next state as well).
  - C9 = ""C8 does not hold"" — false, because C8 does hold.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event2 occurs and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never occurs at any time.
- Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1, C3, C4) is false.
- C5 is the implication ""if C3 then C4""; since C3 and C4 are the same statement, C5 is true (p → p is true).
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false. Hence C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false, and C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because C1 is false at every state.
- C9 is C2 or C8, i.e. false or false, so C9 is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context gives that event2 occurred initially. Also the rules enforce that event1 and event2 alternate (after any event1 there must be an event2, and after any event2 there must be an event1), so event2 does happen (at least initially).

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (initial event2), so C1 is false. C2 is the same and is false.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false, C3 is false.

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is a global ""always"" claim that is already violated, so it cannot become true later; C4 is false. Similarly C5 is false.

- C6 = C1 and C5 is false. Then C7 = C6 and event2 is false. C8 = ""C7 always holds"" is false. Finally C9 = ""C8 eventually holds"" is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- From the context: at the initial state s0 event2 happened. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur in the next state s1. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event2) occur after s1.
- C8 (and C1/C2) assert ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. in s1 relative to s0). But in the determined trace s1 contains event1, not event2, so ""event2 in the next state"" is false.
- C9 requires C8 to be true (it is C7 AND C8). Since C8 is false, C9 is false regardless of the other conjuncts.
- (Additional contradictions in the hypothesis such as ""C4 always holds"" are irrelevant to this final fact but would also be impossible under the given context.)

Step-by-step:

- Context facts: (a) initially event2 happened; (b) after event1, event2 must happen (event1 → later event2); (c) after event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

- C1 and C2 both assert: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" (event2 → event1). The context does not entail this. In particular, we have an actual occurrence of event2 initially, but nothing in the context requires that event1 happened before that or at all. So C1 and C2 are not supported (can be false).

- C6 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — since C1/C2 are not entailed, C6 is false.

- C7 is ""C5 holds and C6 holds"". Because C6 is false, C7 cannot be true (regardless of C5).

1) Understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 does happen (after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → creates mutual recurrence but the key fact is event2 does happen.

2) Simplify the conditions using that fact:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" ≡ Event2 happens. Given the context, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ Event2 does not happen. Given context, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ Event2 happens. True.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" ≡ Event2 happens. True.
- C5: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ Event2 happens. True.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" is an implication: If (Event2 happens) then (Event2 happens) — this is True (premise and conclusion are true).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" is the negation of C6. Since C6 holds (is True), C7 is False.

Context summary: initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen (so event1 can never occur after the initial state). Also after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant because event1 never occurs here).

Step-by-step through the conditions:
- C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just event2 happens. True in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — false, because C1 holds.
- C3: ""C1 does not hold"" — same as C2, false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — false: C3 is false now and nothing can change (no events occur after event2), so C3 never becomes true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — false (C4 is false and will remain false).
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens"" — false (C5 false and event1 cannot occur).
- C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens"" — false (same reasoning).

- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal; there are no further event occurrences after the state where event1 occurs).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This just asserts event1 happens — true in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That requires event1 to happen in the next state. But because event1 is terminal (“after event1, no other events can happen”), there are no event occurrences in the next state, so C1 does not hold there. Thus C2 is false.

- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 forces a later event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur later).

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore no events occur after that initial moment.
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to happen. Event2 does happen (initially), but event1 cannot happen after event2, and there is no earlier time given where event1 happened. So we cannot satisfy “event1 happens.” Thus C1 is false.
- C2 and C3 state “C1 always holds”; since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 is “C2 or C3”; with both false, C4 is false.
- C5 is “C4 eventually holds”; since C4 never holds, C5 is false.
- C6, C7, C8 are “always” versions stacked on a false statement, so they are all false.

Hence C8 is False."

5. C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false because C4 does hold.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1–C4 each assert (event1 AND event2) → all false (because event2 is false).
- C5 = C3 AND C4 → false AND false = false.
- C6 = (event1 → C5). Since event1 is true and C5 is false, C6 is false.
- C7 = C2 OR C6 = false OR false = false.
- C8 = (C1 → C7). C1 is false, so the implication is true (false antecedent makes the conditional true).

3. C3 = (if event2 then C2). Since C2 is always true, C3 is true in every state.
4. C4 = (event2 and event2) = event2 (same as C1).
5. C5 = (C3 or C4). Because C3 is true everywhere, C5 is true in every state.
6. C6 = “C5 holds in the next state.” Since C5 holds in every state, C6 is true.
7. C7 = “C6 does not hold” = not C6, so C7 is false.

We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context about event1 and event2.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment event2 has occurred.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, then a later event2 must occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur after that time.)

Step 3 — consequences for event1
Because event2 already happened initially, no events can occur after that initial moment. That prevents event1 from occurring at any later time. It also prevents event1 from having occurred before the initial event2 (there is no earlier time because event2 is initial). Simultaneity would not satisfy ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (which requires event2 after event1) and is incompatible with ""initially event2 happened"" as a prior constraint. Therefore event1 does not happen at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (event1 and event2): false (event1 does not happen).
- C2 (C1 or event1): false.
- C3 (C2 and event1): false.
- C4 (event2 and C3): false (C3 false).
- C5 (C2 and event1): false.
- C6 (C4 and C5): false.

- We must decide whether C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context and basic consequences
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2, event1 must happen. So event2 does occur (and in fact events alternate indefinitely: event1 → event2 → event1 → ...). Thus ""event2 happens"" is true (it will occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — examine the conditions and their logical relations
- C1: Event2 always happens.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds. So C2 implies C1 (and requires event2).
- C3 = C1 (duplicate).
- C4 = C2 (duplicate).
- C5: C3 or C4, i.e. C1 or C2.
- C6: C5 does not hold, i.e. not(C1 or C2) which is equivalent to (not C1) and (not C2).
- C7: C2 holds and C6 holds. That requires C2 and (not C2) (because C6 entails not C2). That is logically impossible (a direct contradiction).
- C8: C7 eventually holds. If C7 is contradictory, it can never hold.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because C7 is internally contradictory (requires C2 and ¬C2), C7 cannot ever be true, so C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is false.

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci formulas in the initial state
- C1, C2, C5: ""Event2 always happens."" These are false because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (and in fact there are states with no events), so the claim that event2 always happens is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is false, so the implication is true (false implies anything); thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" C4 is true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" C1 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" After the initial event1 no other events can happen, so in the next state the same truth values repeat: C1 is still false, C6 still true, so C7 is still false. Therefore C7 does not hold in the next state, so C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" C8 is already false in the initial state, so C9 is false.

- C1 and C2 (If event2 then event1) are true given the context.
- C3 (event1 happens and C2 holds) is true at s1 (event1 is true there and C2 holds).
- C4 (event2 happens or C3 holds) is true at s0 (event2 holds at s0) and also true at s1 (C3 holds at s1).
- C5 (C4 eventually holds) is true at every state because C4 already holds immediately.

Assumptions about temporal operators:
- ""X happens"" is an atomic proposition that can be true at the moment the event occurs.
- ""φ eventually holds"" means there is some future moment (possibly now) where φ is true.
- ""φ always holds"" means φ is true at all future moments (including now).

Step-by-step analysis
1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the tautology (event1 → event1), so C1 is true at every moment (it holds now and always).

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Because C1 already holds now (indeed always), C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false (now and, as we will see, forever).

4. C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false now. Can C4 become true later? For C4 to become true, C3 would have to hold at all future moments. But C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" C2 depends only on C1 (which is a tautology and thus true at all times), so C2 cannot stop holding; therefore C3 cannot become true at any future time. Thus C4 will never become true, so C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2 — true (C1 holds now).

7. C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false and C6 is true, so C7 is false.

8. C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" Since C7 is false now and cannot become true later (C5 can never become true), C8 is false.

1. Context: initially event2 happened. Rules: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. From the initial event2, it follows that event1 must (eventually) happen, and then event2 must happen again, etc. So event1 does occur.

2. Examine conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 happened initially), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 and C4: ""C2 eventually holds."" Both are false because C2 cannot hold.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Simplify C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just event1. So C1(n) = event1(n) (true at even states, false at odd states).
- C2(n) = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = C1(n+1) = event1(n+1), so C2 is true at odd states and false at even states.
- C3(n) = C2(n) and event1(n). Since C2 is true only at odd states while event1 is true only at even states, C3(n) is false at every state.
- C4(n) = not C3(n) = True at every state.
- C5(n) = ""C4 holds in the next state"" = C4(n+1) = True, so C5 is true at every state.
- C6(n) = ""C5 always holds"" — since C5 is true at every state, C6 is true at every state.
- C7(n) = event1(n) or C6(n) = True (because C6 is true everywhere).

We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — parse the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Given event1 did happen, event2 will (inevitably) occur at some point.
- After event2, no other events can happen. event2 is terminal.

So the actual event sequence is: event1 (initially) → event2 (must follow) → end.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 did happen and the context forces event2 after event1, event2 does indeed occur. So C1 is true.
- C2, C3, C5: each is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is true and event1 did happen, so each implication is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.

Step 4 — C7: ""C6 always holds""
C6 is a logical statement built from C1–C5; given the context it is true and nothing in the context makes those component truths time-dependent or false later. Therefore C6 holds (and holds persistently), so C7 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened, so C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true in the initial state.
- The context says after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no next state after the initial state. In standard temporal semantics, a ""next"" formula is false at a last state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false. Likewise C3 (same as C2) is false.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false because C3 does not hold in the (only) state.
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false (no next state), and C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.
- C7 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C7 holds.
- C8 is ""C7 does not hold"" — since C7 does hold, C8 is false."

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not happen (event2 is false).

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event1 happened, C1 = False.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" That's False or False = False.

2. Evaluate the Ci at S0 and S1 as needed:

- We must decide whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — model the timeline from the context
- Initial state s0: event1 happened (given).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — since event1 already happened at s0, no events (including event2) can occur at any future state.
- So all future states s1, s2, ... have no events; in particular event1 and event2 do not occur in those states.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions state by state (starting at s0)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At s0 this is false (event1 did happen). At s1 and later C1 is true (no events occur there).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" From s0, the next state is s1 where C1 is true, so C2 is true in s0.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true in s0.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Although C3 holds in s0, event2 does not happen at s0 (it never happens), so C4 is false at s0. (In fact C4 is false in every state because event2 never occurs.)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false at s0, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false everywhere, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds."" C2 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false at s0.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is already false at s0, so C8 is false.

False"

1. At S0:
- event2 happened = True, event1 = False.

- C4 (same as C1 at S0) = True.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") requires C1 to be true at S1; we'll evaluate that below.

2. At S1:

- Hence C2 and C3 (which assert C1 holds in the next state) are False when evaluated at S0 (because C1 is false at S1).
- C4 at S0 we already have True; C5 = C3 and C4 = False and True = False.
- C6 = C2 and C5 = False and False = False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- At the initial state S0, event1 happened.
- The context says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore in every future state (S1, S2, ...) no events occur — in particular, event2 never occurs at any state.
- Evaluate C1 at S0: C1 asserts ""event2 happens in the next state (S1)"". Since event2 never occurs, C1 is false at S0.
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds in the next state (S1)"". That would require event2 at S2, which cannot happen, so C2 is false at S0. The same reasoning makes C3 false.
- C4 (C2 and C3) is false; C5 (C4 and event2) is false; C6 (""eventually C5"") is false because C5 never becomes true; C7 (""always C6"") is false; therefore C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is false.

Hence C8 is False."

- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context.

- Initially event1 happened (so at time t0 event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (there is some later time t1 > t0 where event2 occurs).
- After event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; there are no times after t1 with other events).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This requires event1 to hold at every relevant time point. But we have at least two time points: t0 (event1) and t1 (event2). At t1 event1 does not necessarily hold (event2 occurs and no other events happen afterward), so C1 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpreting each atomic statement as an event occurrence at a single time instant, the conjunction ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (C1/C4) requires both events to be true at the same instant.

- From the context: initially event2 happens. The rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" force an infinite alternation: event2, then at some later time event1, then later event2, then event1, etc. The two events never occur at the same instant.

- Therefore C1 (and C4) never hold (there is no time where both events happen simultaneously). If C1 is false, then:
  - C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false,
  - C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false,
  - C5 (C3 and C4) is false,
  - and hence every subsequent statement (C6, C7, C8, C9) is false or cannot become true.

- In particular C9 is false."

C7 is the statement “C6 holds or event2 happens.” We must decide whether C7 is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 does indeed happen (at least once, and in fact repeatedly in the alternating sequence).

C7 is a disjunction: C6 ∨ event2. A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true.

Step 3 — conclusion
Because the context guarantees that event2 happens, the disjunction C6 ∨ event2 is true regardless of the truth of C6.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and the rules say after event2, event1 must happen (and then event2 must follow event1). Thus event1 does occur (immediately after the initial event2), and the sequence alternates thereafter.

2. C1 and C2 state ""Event1 does not happen."" Those are false because event1 must occur after the initial event2.

3. C3 = ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.

4. C4 = ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

5. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false and cannot become true given the required alternation, so C5 is false.

6. C6 = ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

7. C7 = ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is already true, so C7 is true.

8. C8 = ""C1 holds and C7 holds."" C1 is false, so C8 is false.

9. C9 = ""C8 holds in the next state."" Since C8 is false now and remains false (event1 happens next), C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

- C1 = (event1 or event2). In the initial state this is true (event1 happened).

- C2 = Next(C1). In the next state after the initial one, neither event1 nor event2 holds, so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 is false in the initial state.

- C3 = Next(C2). Evaluate C2 in the next state: it is Next(C1) relative to that state, and in the subsequent state C1 is again false (no events), so C2 is false in the next state. Thus C3 is false in the initial state.

- We must decide whether C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the C1–C7 conditions.

Examine the context and conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened (call that state S0). After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs in the next state S1). After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs in S2), so events alternate indefinitely.
- C1 and C2: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the context, event1 does happen in the next state (S1). So C1 and C2 are true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" C2 holds, and event2 happens (it happened in S0 and will happen again in S2). So C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 is true and event1 indeed happens (in S1), so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C3, so true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" At least one holds, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true and C6 is true, so the implication C7 is true.

- C7 holds, therefore ""C7 does not hold"" (C8) is false.

Reasoning step-by-step (evaluating in the initial state where event2 holds):

1. From the context we get an alternating sequence of events:
   - s0 (initial): event2.
   - s1: event1 (because after event2, event1 must happen).
   - s2: event2 (because after event1, event2 must happen).
   - and so on (alternating event2, event1, event2, ...).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 that is true (s1 has event1).

3. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" At s0 event1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true. (In general, C2 is false at states where event1 holds because event1 is not followed by event1 in the next state, but that does not affect s0.)

4. C3 = C2 ∨ event1. At every state this is true:
   - At states where event1 holds (s1, s3, ...), event1 makes C3 true.
   - At states where event1 does not hold (s0, s2, ...), C2 is vacuously true, so C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 holds in every state, C4 is true.

6. C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" C4 is global/always true, so the implication holds; C5 is true.

7. C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" Since C5 is true everywhere, C6 is true in every state.

8. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Because C6 holds in all states, C7 is true (in particular true at s0).

9. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is true, C8 is false.

10. C9: ""Event1 happens or C8 holds."" At s0, event1 is false and C8 is false, so C9 is false in the initial state.

Therefore C9 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step, assuming ""after"" means in the immediate next state):

- Timeline forced by the context: S0: event2 (initial). Because after event2 event1 must happen, S1: event1. Because after event1 event2 must happen, S2: event2, and so on (they alternate).

- C1 (""event2 eventually happens""): True (already true at S0).

- C2 and C3 (""if event2 happens then C1""): True (C1 holds, so the implication holds wherever evaluated).

- C4 (""if C3 holds then event2 happens""): At S0, C3 holds and event2 is true, so C4 holds in S0. But at S1, although C3 still holds (C1 remains true), event2 does not hold (S1 has event1), so C4 is false in S1.

- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state""): At S0 this requires C4 to hold in S1, but C4 is false in S1, so C5 is false in S0.

- C6 (""C5 holds and event2 happens""): False in S1 (and at S0) because event2 is not true in S1 and C5 is false.

- C7 (""if C2 holds then C6 holds""): At S1, C2 holds but C6 does not, so C7 is false in S1.

- C8 (""C7 holds in the next state""): At S0 this requires C7 to hold in S1, but C7 is false in S1. Therefore C8 is false."

Interpretation and timeline
- Initial state S0: event2 happened.
- After event2 (next state S1): event1 must happen.
- After event1 (S2): event2 must happen.
So events alternate: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, ...

We evaluate C9 at the initial state S0: it asserts that C8 holds in the next state (i.e. at S1).

Evaluate conditions at S1 (where event1 is true, event2 is false):
- C1: (event1 → event1) is a tautology → True.
- C2: same as C1 → True.
- C3: (event2 OR C2) = (False OR True) = True.
- C4: (C3 AND event2) = (True AND False) = False.
- C5: (C4 does not hold) = NOT False = True.
- C6: (C5 does not hold) = NOT True = False.
- C7: (C6 always holds). Since C6 is False at S1, ""always"" fails → C7 is False.
- C8: (C1 AND C7) = (True AND False) = False.

Thus C8 does not hold in S1. Therefore C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") evaluated at S0 is False.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions over time

- C2 (C1 and event2): true at t0 because event2 happened and C1 is true there. It remains true as a fact (event2 has happened).
- C3 (event1 and C2): becomes true at t1 (event1 occurs and C2 holds from earlier).
- C4 (event2 or C3): true at t0 (event2) and at t1 (C3).

- C6 (C5 always holds): true (C5 holds at all times).
- C7 (C6 always holds): true (same reasoning).
- C8 (event2 and C7): requires event2 to hold at the same time as C7. C7 holds at all times, but event2 happens only at t0, so C8 is true at t0 and false at times after t0.
