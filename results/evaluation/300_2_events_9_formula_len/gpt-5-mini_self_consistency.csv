Sample responses:
We are asked whether C7 is true.

1) Identify formulas:
- C1 and C2 are the same statement: ""Event2 always happens"" (call it P).
- C3 and C4 are ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"", i.e. P → P.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 = (P → P) ∧ (P → P).
- C6 = next(C5).
- C7 = next(C6) = next(next(C5)).

2) Evaluate:
- P → P is a tautology, true regardless of whether P itself holds. So C3 and C4 are true in every state.
- Therefore C5 is true in every state.
- If C5 is true in every state, then next(C5) (C6) is true in every state as well.
- Hence next(next(C5)) (C7) is true.

The dynamics of event1/event2 are irrelevant because the implications are tautological. Therefore C7 is True.
---

---
Step 1 — understand the system
- Timeline: initially (state 0) event2 happened.
- Rules: after event1, event2 must happen next; after event2, event1 must happen next.
- That forces alternation: state0 has event2, state1 must have event1, state2 must have event2, etc.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false, because at state1 event1 happens (so event2 does not occur in every state).
- C2: same as C1, so also false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Since both are true, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is a logical fact (true), so it also holds in the next state; C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Since C6 is true (and the truth of these statements is stable here), C7 is true.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 occurs.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — True (C1 is True).
- C3: same as C2 — True.

We are asked whether C7 is true given the context.

1. From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen (so event1 does occur eventually). After event1 no further events occur.
2. C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — true, because event2 happened initially (and event1 also happens later).
3. C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — true, since C1 is true.
4. C3: same as C2 — true.
5. C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" — true, because C2 and C3 are both true.
6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — true, since C4 already holds now (so it holds at some time).
7. C6: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — true, since C1 holds.
8. C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds"" — both conjuncts are true, so C7 is true.

We are asked whether C7 holds given the event context.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From the context the actual event sequence is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (event2 happens, and event1 also happens later).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" True (C1 already true).
- C3: same as C2. True.

Goal: determine whether C7 is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- From context: event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens. So both event1 and event2 are true.

- C1: ""event2 or event2"" → equivalent to event2. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 and event2"" → since C1 is event2, C2 reduces to event2, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""event1 or C2"" → becomes ""event1 or event2"", which is true (both are true).
- C4: same as C3 → true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" → false (because C4 holds).
- C6: ""event2 or C5"" → since event2 is true, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C3 or C6"" → true or true → true.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
- Determine whether C7 is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Event1 happens initially.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" → true (since event2 happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" → true (C1 true and event2 happens).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" → true (event1 happens).
- C4: same as C3 → true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" → false (C4 holds).
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds"" → true (event2 happens).
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds"" → true (C3 holds).

Answer:

You ask whether C7 is True or False.

From the context:
- Event1 happened → Event1 is true.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen → Event2 is true.
- After Event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here since we only need Event1 and Event2).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 = (Event2 or Event2) = Event2 = true.
- C2 = C1 and Event2 = true and true = true.
- C3 = Event1 or C2 = true or true = true.
- C4 = Event1 or C2 = true or true = true.
- C5 = not C4 = not true = false.
- C6 = Event2 or C5 = true or false = true.
- C7 = C3 or C6 = true or true = true.

Goal: is C6 true or false?

Interpretation: events occur in discrete states s0, s1, s2, ...; ""Initially, event2 happened"" means event2 occurs at s0. ""After event2, event1 must happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen"" enforce the alternating sequence: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

Now evaluate the Ci at s0:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreting this as a statement about the same state: C1 is false in any state where event2 occurs (because event1 does not also occur in that same state), and true in states where event2 does not occur (vacuously). So:
  - C1 is false at s0 (event2 occurs at s0).
  - C1 is true at s1 (event1 occurs, not event2).
  - C1 is false at s2 (event2 occurs), true at s3, etc. So C1 alternates: false on even states, true on odd states.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At s0, C2 asserts C1 holds in s1. Since C1 is true at s1, C2 is true at s0.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" At s0, C3 is the negation of C2 at s0, so C3 is false (because C2 is true at s0).

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Is there some future state where C3 is true? At s1, evaluate C2 at s1: C2 at s1 says ""C1 holds in s2"". But C1 is false in s2 (because event2 occurs at s2), so C2 is false at s1, hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true at s1. So C3 holds at s1, hence C4 is true.

- C5 is the same as C4, so it is also true.

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — both are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the context as an infinite alternating sequence of events starting from the initial state:
   - State 0: event2 happens.
   - State 1: event1 happens (because after event2, event1 must happen).
   - State 2: event2 happens (because after event1, event2 must happen).
   - State 3: event1 happens.
   - And so on, alternating e2, e1, e2, e1, ...

2. Read the conditions with usual temporal semantics:
   - C1: (event2 -> event1) evaluated at a state (i.e., if event2 holds in this state then event1 also holds in this same state).
   - C2: X C1 (C1 holds in the next state).
   - C3: not C2.
   - C4: F C3 (C3 eventually holds).
   - C5: F C3 (same as C4).
   - C6: C4 and C5.

3. Evaluate C1 on the timeline:
   - At any state where event2 occurs (states 0,2,4,...), event1 does not occur simultaneously, so C1 is false at those states.
   - At states where event1 occurs (states 1,3,5,...), event2 is false, so C1 is true there (implication vacuously true).

4. Evaluate C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"":
   - At state 0, C1 at state1 is true, so C2 is true at state0.
   - At state 1, C1 at state2 is false, so C2 is false at state1.
   - Thus C2 alternates true/false along the run (true at even states, false at odd states).

5. C3 = not C2 thus holds at odd states (1,3,5,...). Therefore:
   - C4 (eventually C3) is true (e.g., C3 holds at state1).
   - C5 is the same statement and is also true.

6. Therefore C6 = C4 and C5 is true.

So the final answer is True."

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 initially happened, and after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen. Thus event2 does happen (indeed infinitely often in the alternating sequence).

2. C1, C2, C3 each state ""Event2 does not happen."" Given (1), each of C1–C3 is false.

3. C4 is ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" The antecedent is true (event2 does happen) and the consequent C3 is false, so C4 is false.

4. C5 is ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both C2 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

5. C6 is ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 never holds, C6 is false.

6. C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" Because C1 is false, the implication C1 -> C6 is true (false antecedent makes the implication true). So C7 is true.

7. C8 is ""C7 holds or event1 happens."" C7 is true, so C8 is true (and remains true even at times when event1 is not occurring).

8. C9 is ""C8 always holds."" Because C7 is true persistently, C8 holds at every time, so C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.

Step 1 — question
We must determine the truth value of C9.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no event (including event2) can occur at any future state.
- After event2, event1 must happen (this is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — false (event2 can never occur).
- C3 is the same as C1 — false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, this implication is vacuously true.
- C4 = C2 and C3 → false (because C3 is false).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" → false (C4 never becomes true because event2 never occurs).
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" Antecedent C5 is false, so C6 is vacuously true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds now, so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is true, C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" C8 is false, so C9 is true.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

- Context facts:
  - Initially event1 has happened.
  - After event1 no other events can happen; therefore no event can occur after the initial state.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant because event2 can never occur given the previous fact.)

- Consequence: event2 cannot happen at any time (because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur afterwards).

Now evaluate the Ci:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False (event2 cannot happen).
2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C1), so C2 is vacuously true.
3. C3: same as C1: False.
4. C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" False (C3 is false).
5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" False (C4 never holds because it requires event2).
6. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" Antecedent C5 is false, so C6 is vacuously true.
7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds, so C7 is true.
8. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" False (since C7 is true).
9. C9: ""C8 does not hold."" This is just not(C8). Since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
We are asked whether C9 is True or False.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no further events ever occur after the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (but event2 never occurs here because event1 already happened and blocks further events).

Evaluate the Ci one by one:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False — no events can occur after event1.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is vacuously true because C1 is false; so C2 is True.
- C3: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Same as C1, False.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" C2 is True, C3 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false now and will never become true (no events to change things), so C5 is False.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" C5 is false, so this implication is vacuously true; C6 is True.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is already true, so C7 is True.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" C7 is True, so C8 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, event2 cannot happen after event1, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C1 is false in every reachable state (no events can occur after event1), so C2 is true in every state; hence C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C4, so C5 is also true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Antecedent C4 is true and consequent C5 is true, so the implication C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C6 is the formula ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" We must decide whether C6 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

So the actual execution starts with event1 and then no further events ever occur. In particular, event2 never occurs in any reachable state.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, event2 does not and cannot happen after the initial event1. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true in the initial state and remains true in all reachable states (no new events can make C1 true), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C4, so C5 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C6
C6 is ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Both antecedent (C4) and consequent (C5) are true, so the implication C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"", i.e. C4 → C5) is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (which is already the case), no future state can have any further events, in particular event2 cannot occur in any next state.
- Also, after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event2 never happens given the first two facts.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given that event1 already happened and no events can occur after event1, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C1 cannot become true in any state (no events after event1), so C2 is true in all states; hence C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C4, so C5 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C6
- C6 is the implication C4 → C5. Both C4 and C5 are true, so the implication is true (and in fact C4 and C5 are the same formula here).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from the initial state there is no successor state in which further events occur).
- Also, after event2 no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since, in the actual system starting from the initial state, event2 cannot happen (event1 already happened and prevents any further events), the antecedent is never true. Thus the implication is vacuously true. So C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial (because after event1 no other events can happen), so a ""next"" claim is false in standard temporal semantics. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" C1 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C4, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- C6 is (C4) and (C5). Since C4 and C5 are the same formula (C1 ∨ C3), C6 is equivalent to C1 ∨ C3. So we only need to decide whether C1 holds or C3 holds (or both).

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen. Therefore there is no state after the initial state in which any further event occurs.
- In particular, event2 never happens in any reachable state.

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 never happens, the antecedent is never true, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C1 holds.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 holds as well.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no state after the initial one), so Next(C2) is false (there is no next-state where to evaluate C2). Thus C3 does not hold.
- Therefore C1 ∨ C3 is true (because C1 is true).

Step 4 — Conclusion
- C6 = C1 ∨ C3 is true.

Final answer: True

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the question
   - We must decide whether C6 (C4 and C5) is true given the context.

2. Understand the context
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened there are no further events).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
   - Because event1 happened initially and it is terminal, event2 never occurs in any reachable state.

3. Examine each condition
   - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 never happens in any reachable state, the implication is vacuously true. So C1 holds.
   - C2: same as C1, so C2 also holds (vacuously).

   - C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Because C1 holds, C4 is true.
   - C5: identical to C4, so C5 is true.
   - C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
What is asked
- Determine whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true given the initial facts about events.

Given facts about events
1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. After event1, no other events can happen.
3. After event2, event1 must happen.

From these facts
- Because event1 already happened initially (fact 1) and after event1 no other events can happen (fact 2), no further events (including event2) can ever occur. So event1 holds (is true) at the initial moment and at every subsequent moment; event2 never occurs.

Evaluate the conditions
- C1: event1 or event2. True (event1 holds).
- C2: C1 or event1. True (C1 is true, and event1 is true).
- C3: event1 or C2. True.
- C4: event1 or event2. Same as C1 — true.
- C5: C1 or event1. Same as C2 — true.
- C6: If C4 then C5. Antecedent C4 is true and consequent C5 is true, so the implication is true.
- C7: If C3 then C6. Antecedent C3 is true and consequent C6 is true, so the implication is true.
- Because no events occur after the initial state, these truth values do not change over time; in particular C7 holds at the initial moment and at every subsequent moment.

Conclusion
- C7 always holds, so C8 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C8 asserts that “C7 always holds.” We must decide whether C7 is true (and, given the context, holds always).

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event1 happened → event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event2 cannot occur (so event2 is false).
- “After event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant because event2 does not occur.

So: event1 = True, event2 = False.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: event1 or event2 = True or False = True.
- C2: C1 or event1 = True or True = True.
- C3: event1 or C2 = True or True = True.
- C4: event1 or event2 = True.
- C5: C1 or event1 = True.
- C6: (C4 → C5). Antecedent True, consequent True → C6 = True.
- C7: (C3 → C6). Antecedent True, consequent True → C7 = True.

Step 4 — C8 (“C7 always holds”)
Given the context there are no further events that could change these truth values, and we found C7 is true. Therefore C7 holds (and, under the given constraints, holds always).

Final answer:
True
---
We are asked whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is True or False under the given context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no events (including event2) can occur after that — so event2 cannot occur at any time in this scenario.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.)

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: event1 or event2. True (event1 happens).
- C2: C1 or event1. True (C1 is true).
- C3: event1 or C2. True.
- C4: event1 or event2. True (same as C1).
- C5: C1 or event1. True.
- C6: If C4 then C5. True (C4 true and C5 true, so implication holds).
- C7: If C3 then C6. True (C3 true and C6 true).

C8 states ""C7 always holds."" Given the context, C7 is true, so C8 is True.

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is true given the setup.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context: the system forces an alternating sequence of events starting with event2: event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, ... So at every state either event1 or event2 holds.

2. Examine the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is true (in fact true at every state).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True, since C1 already holds now.
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Whether viewed as a logical implication or temporally, C2 is true and event1 does occur (at the next step), so C3 holds in the relevant states.
   - C4 and C5: both are the same statement, ""C3 holds in the next state."" They are syntactically identical.

3. C6 is the implication ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Because C4 and C5 are the same proposition, C4 → C5 is tautologically true (any statement implies itself).

Conclusion: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step by step):
1. The question asks whether C6, which is ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" (C4 → C5), is true.
2. C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state."" C5 is the same sentence: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
3. Thus C4 and C5 are the same proposition (call it A). C6 is therefore A → A.
4. Any formula of the form A → A is a tautology (always true). Even if A is false, the implication is true; if A is true, the implication is true because the antecedent and consequent coincide.
5. Therefore C6 is True, independent of the other conditions or the event context.
---
First: the question asks whether C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Context gives an alternating sequence starting with event2: initially event2 happens, then event1 must happen, then event2 must happen, and so on. So at every state one of {event1, event2} holds (they alternate).

- C1 = (event2 or event1). Because of alternation, C1 is true already (in every state).

- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds now (and always), C2 is true.

- C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true, so C3 reduces to ""event1 happens."" Given the alternation and initial event2, event1 does indeed happen (in the next state), so C3 holds (in the appropriate state).

- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state."" C5 = ""C3 holds in the next state."" They are the same formula.

- C6 = ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Since C4 and C5 are identical, C6 is a tautological implication p -> p and therefore true (whenever C4 holds, C5 holds as they are the same).

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C9 (C7 or C8) is true given:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step-by-step:

1. Because event1 happened initially and “after event1 no other events can happen,” no event2 can ever occur in any future state.

2. C1 and C8 both assert “Event1 happens in the next state.” Nothing in the premises requires event1 to occur in the next state (the premises only forbid other events after the initial event1). So C1 and C8 are not guaranteed; treat them as false.

3. Since event2 cannot occur, any condition that requires event2 (C2, C3, C5) is false. Consequent universal or eventual claims built from those (C4, C6, C7) are therefore false as well.

4. Thus C7 is false and C8 is false, so C9 = (C7 or C8) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning:

- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means that once event1 has occurred (here, initially), no events occur in any later state. So in the next state and every subsequent state there are no events at all (in particular, event1 does not occur in the next state, and event2 never occurs anywhere).
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is therefore false.
- C2 (C1 and event2) is false because C1 is false.
- C3 (event2 and C2) is false.
- C4 (C3 always holds) is false.
- C5 (event2 or C4) is false.
- C6 (C5 always holds) is false.
- C7 (C6 eventually holds) is false.
- C8 is the same as C1, so false.
- C9 (C7 or C8) is false or false, hence false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context:
  - At the initial state event1 has happened.
  - After event1, no events can happen at any later state. So no events (in particular event2) can ever occur after the initial state.
  - The constraint ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1 / C8: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since after the initial state no events occur, event1 does not happen in the next state → C1 and C8 are false.
  - C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is false and event2 never happens → C2 false.
  - C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" event2 never happens → C3 false.
  - C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false (not true at all times) → C4 false.
  - C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are false → C5 false.
  - C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false → C6 false.
  - C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 never holds → C7 false.

- C9 is ""C7 holds or C8 holds."" Both C7 and C8 are false, so C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

- From ""After event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will happen (after the initial event2).
- From ""After event1, no other events can happen"", nothing happens after event1 — that does not affect the initial truth that event2 already happened.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (we were told event2 happened).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" = false or false = false.
- C4: same as C3 = false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = not(false) = true.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds"" = false and true = false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = not(false) = true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen. So the sequence is: event2 then event1, and then nothing else.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" False (event2 did happen).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" False or False => False.
- C4: same as C3. False.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is True.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" False and True => False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is false, so C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify propositions:
- Let E2 mean ""Event2 happens"".
- C1: ¬E2.
- C2: ¬E2.
- C3: C1 ∨ C2 = ¬E2 ∨ ¬E2 = ¬E2.
- C4: C1 ∨ C2 = ¬E2.
- C5: ¬C4 = ¬(¬E2) = E2.
- C6: C3 ∧ C5 = (¬E2) ∧ E2 = false.
- C7: ¬C6 = true.

Step 2 — use context:
- The context says initially event2 happened, so E2 is true. That makes C1 and C2 false, C3 and C4 false, C5 true, C6 false, and therefore C7 true.

Goal: determine whether C8 is True or False given the context.

Context summary:
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen in any later state.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event2 never happens).

Set up states s0 (now), s1 (next), s2 (next after s1), ...

Evaluate the Ci step by step at s0:

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state (s1)."" By Rule A, after event1 no events occur in later states, so event1 does NOT happen in s1. Therefore C1 = False.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 cannot happen after event1 (Rule A), and C1 is false, so C2 = False.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 = False.
- C4: C2 or C3 = False or False = False.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds"" = False (event2 doesn't occur and C4 is false).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" = True (since C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state (s1)."" Check C6 at s1: same reasoning applies at s1 and all future states (no events ever occur after s0), so C5 is false in s1 and C6 is true in s1. Thus C7 = True at s0.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state (s1)."" We need C7 at s1, i.e. C6 holds in s2. C6 is true in every future state (C5 is false everywhere), so C7 is true in s1. Therefore C8 = True.

Conclusion: True.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context:
   - At the initial state (call it state0) event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 occurs in the next state (state1).
   - After event2 no other events can happen — so no event occurs in state2 and later.

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state (state0):
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" True (event2 occurs in state1).
   - C2: same as C1. True.
   - C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" True (both C2 and event1 are true at state0).
   - C4: ""C3 always holds."" False, because at state1 C2 is false (event2 does not occur in state2) and event1 does not hold at state1, so C3 is false at state1; thus C3 is not always true.
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False (C4 is false everywhere, so certainly false in the next state).
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (since C5 is false).
   - C7: same as C1/C2. True.
   - C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" True (both disjuncts true at state0).
3. C9: ""If C1 holds, then C8 holds."" At state0 C1 is true and C8 is true, so the implication is true.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
First: the question asks whether the implication C9 (""If C1 holds, then C8 holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Translate the relevant conditions:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C7 = ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (same as C1)
- C8 = ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" So C8 is true whenever C7 is true.

From C1 (Event2 happens in the next state) we immediately get C7 (the same statement). From C7 we get C8 (since C8 is C6 or C7). Thus C1 ⇒ C8 holds.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
We are asked whether C9 (""If C1 holds, then C8 holds"") is true given the listed conditions and the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1, C2, and C7 all state the same thing: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" So C2 ≡ C1 and C7 ≡ C1.
- C8 is ""C6 holds or C7 holds"", so C8 ≡ C6 ∨ C7 ≡ C6 ∨ C1.
- C9 is ""If C1 holds, then C8 holds"", i.e. C1 → (C6 ∨ C1).
- The implication C1 → (C6 ∨ C1) is a propositional tautology: A → (B ∨ A) is always true (because if A is true then B ∨ A is true; if A is false the implication is vacuously true).
- The context (initial event1 and ""after event1, event2 must happen"") in fact makes C1 true in the initial situation, but that is not needed: the implication is true regardless.

Therefore C9 is True."

True

Reasoning (brief):
- Let s0 be the initial state. By the context, s0: event1 true. Then s1: event2 true (events alternate).
- C8 says ""C7 holds in the next state"" — so we must check whether C7 holds in s1.
- At s1: event2 is true. C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") at s1 has a false antecedent (event1 is false at s1), so C1 is true at s1. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false at s1.
- C6 is ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds""; since C2 is false at s1, C6 is true at s1 (implication with false antecedent).
- Therefore C7 (""C6 holds and event2 happens"") is true at s1 (true ∧ true).
- So C7 does hold in the next state s1, and C8 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Timeline from the context:
- Start: event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → the next state has event2.
- After event2, no further events can happen → the event2 state is terminal.

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state (with ""next"" referring to the immediate next state, the event2 state):

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (φ → φ), so C1 is true in any state.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state is the event2 state; C1 is true there (tautology), so C2 is true at the initial state.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we just saw C2 holds, so C3 is false.

- C4: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the same as C2, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Since C3 is false and C4 is true, C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" There are only the initial and the event2 states (event2 is terminal). C5 is false in both, so C6 is false.

- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" C7 is false, so this statement is true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- The question asks whether C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C7.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (φ → φ) and so holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 holds in every state, C2 is true whenever a next state exists. The context guarantees a next state after the initial one (after event1, event2 must happen), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" That requires both C3 (false) and C4 (true), so C5 is false (a contradiction).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is impossible/always false, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is false, C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This is the negation of C7; since C7 is false, C8 is true.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C8 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 never happens (it cannot occur after the initial event1, and there is no earlier occurrence).

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci’s:
- C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens""): false, because event2 does not happen.
- C2 (same as C1): false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold""): true (since C2 is false).
- C4 (""C3 holds and event1 happens""): true (C3 is true and event1 did happen initially).
- C5 (""C2 does not hold""): true (same as C3).
- C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds""): true (C4 is true and C5 is true, so the implication is true).
- C7 (""C6 holds in the next state""): true — whether or not event1 still holds in the next state, C2 remains false so C3 and C5 remain true or the implication in C6 is vacuously true; hence C6 holds in the next state, so C7 holds.

Step 3 — C8 (""If C1 holds, then C7 holds""):
- C1 is false, so the implication ""If C1 then C7"" is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C8 is the formula ""If C1 holds, then C7 holds."" We must determine whether C8 is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — the scenario
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Because event1 already happened initially, no other events can ever happen after that point. In particular, event2 does not and cannot happen at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: event2 and event1. Since event2 never happens, C1 = False.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 = False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" → C3 = True.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens"" → C4 = True (C3 True and event1 happened).
- C5: ""C2 does not hold"" → C5 = True.
- C6: ""If C4 holds then C5 holds"" → C6 = True (antecedent and consequent both true).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Since no events occur after the initial state, the truth values persist, so C6 is still true in the next state → C7 = True.

Step 4 — evaluate C8
- C8 is the implication C1 → C7. C1 is False, so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step by step):

- Timeline from the context: at t0 event2 holds; then events alternate: t1 event1, t2 event2, t3 event1, ….

- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — false (at t0 event1 is false).

- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — false (C1 is false).

- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" — at t0 event2 is true but C2 is false, so C3 is false at t0 (C3 is true at states where event2 is false, but not everywhere).

- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — true at t0 (because C3 is false there), but not true at every state.

- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — false, because C4 is not true at the states where C3 does hold.

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — false, since C5 never becomes true.

- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — false.

- C8: ""C7 eventually holds"" — false.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Thus C9 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (call that state 0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so state 1 has event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state 2 has event2).
Thus the system alternates: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, … So event1 holds in exactly the odd states, not in every state.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 does not hold in even states).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" At states where event2 happens (e.g. initially), C2 is false, so the implication is false → C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is a global truth (C3 is false), so C4 holds at every state; hence C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 holds always, it certainly holds eventually, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Because C6 is true now and remains true (C5 is always true), C6 also holds in the next state → C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 already holds, so C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is true, C9 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — model the context
- Initially event2 occurs (time 0).
- After event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: time 0: event2, time 1: event1, time 2: event2, time 3: event1, …

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False — event1 does not occur at even times (time 0, 2, ... have event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" False — C1 is false, so the conjunction is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" False — event2 does happen (e.g. at time 0) but C2 is false, so the implication is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True — C3 is false, so its negation holds.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True — C3 is false at every time (because event2 recurs and C2 is always false), so C4 is true at every time; hence always holds.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" True — if C5 always holds, it certainly eventually holds.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" True — C6 is true now, and remains true in the next state.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" True — C7 already holds, so it eventually holds.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" False — C8 is true, so its negation is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once we are in the initial state (where event1 has happened), no event (including event2) can occur in the next state.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur given the previous rule.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Impossible (no events can happen after event1) → C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1 → C2 is False.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Since C2 is False, C3 is False.
- C4: “If C1 holds, then C3 holds.” An implication with a false antecedent is True (vacuously true) → C4 is True.
- C5: same as C4 → C5 is True.

Step 3 — final
- C6 = C4 and C5 = True and True = True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C6 is the conjunction (C4 holds) AND (C5 holds). So we must decide whether both implications C4 and C5 are true in the given scenario.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred (which is already true initially), no future state can have any other event, in particular event2 can never occur in any future state.
- C1 and C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, event2 cannot occur, so C1 and C2 are false in the current state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" would assert that (from the next state) event2 happens in its next state (i.e. event2 two steps ahead). Irrelevant because event2 is impossible.
- C4 and C5: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Each is an implication whose antecedent (C1) is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 and C5
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Since C1 cannot hold under the context, both C4 and C5 are true.

Step 4 — conclude C6
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5, so C6 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C6 is the conjunction “C4 holds and C5 holds.” So we need to decide whether both implications C4 and C5 are true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred at the start).  
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).  
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs then event1 must occur afterwards).

Step 3 — understand the conditions
- C1: event2 happens in the next state (i.e. event2 at s+1).  
- C2: event2 happens in the next state (same as C1).  
- C3: C2 holds in the next state (i.e. event2 happens at s+2).  
- C4: If C1 holds then C3 holds (if event2 at s+1 then event2 at s+2).  
- C5: same as C4.  
- C6: C4 and C5.

Step 4 — reason about possible events
Because event1 already happened initially and “after event1 no other events can happen,” event2 cannot occur in any future state. So C1 and C2 are false (event2 does not happen in the next state), and C3 is false as well.

Step 5 — evaluate the implications
An implication with a false antecedent is true. Since C1 is false, “If C1 then C3” is true. Both C4 and C5 are true (they are the same implication). Therefore C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is true ∧ true = True.

Sample responses:
Goal: determine truth of C9 (""C8 always holds"").

Interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the initial state).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal but does not prevent itself from occurring).

Thus ""Event1 eventually happens"" is true.

Evaluate the Ci one by one:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens → True.
- C2: Event1 eventually happens → True.
- C3: Event1 eventually happens → True.
- C4: C3 does not hold → False (because C3 is True).
- C5: C4 does not hold → True (because C4 is False).
- C6: C2 holds or C5 holds → True (C2 is True, C5 is True).
- C7: C1 holds or C6 holds → True.
- C8: C7 always holds — since C1/C6 are global truths about the trace (event1 will eventually occur), C7 is true at every point, so C8 is True.
- C9: C8 always holds — same reasoning: C8 is true at every point, so C9 is True.

Conclusion: True
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Interpret the context:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so from the initial state, event1 will occur at some future point).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the possible timeline is: initial state (event2 has happened) → at some later time event1 happens → then no further events.

2) Evaluate the labeled conditions (interpreting phrases like ""event1 eventually happens"" as the temporal formula F(event1), and ""always"" as G(...)):

- C1, C2, C3: ""Event1 eventually happens."" At the initial state these are true (because event1 must occur after event2). After event1 has happened, from that later state ""event1 eventually happens"" is false (no more events happen). So C1–C3 are true initially but become false after event1.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Initially false (because C3 holds initially). After event1, C3 is false, so C4 becomes true. So C4 changes truth value over time.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Initially true (since C4 is initially false). After event1 it becomes false. So C5 also changes.

- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Initially true (C2 true). After event1, both C2 and C5 are false, so C6 becomes false.

- C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" Initially true (C1 true). After event1, both disjuncts are false, so C7 becomes false.

- C8: ""C7 always holds"" (G(C7)). This requires C7 to be true at all future points. But as shown, C7 becomes false after event1, so C8 is false (it does not hold at the initial state).

- C9: ""C8 always holds"" (G(C8)). Since C8 is already false at the initial state, C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur at some point.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).

Therefore the run contains event1 (it will eventually occur).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: Event1 eventually happens. True (from context).
- C2: Event1 eventually happens. True (same as C1).
- C3: Event1 eventually happens. True.
- C4: C3 does not hold. False (because C3 is true).
- C5: C4 does not hold. True (because C4 is false).
- C6: C2 holds or C5 holds. True (both disjuncts are true).
- C7: C1 holds or C6 holds. True.
- C8: C7 always holds. Since C7 is a factual property of the run (it is true), ""always C7"" is true.
- C9: C8 always holds. C8 is true, so ""always C8"" is true.

Sample responses:
Plan: evaluate formulas at the initial state s0 (where event1 already happened), using the background facts:
- After event1 no other events can happen ⇒ from s0 onward no events occur (so event2 never occurs).
- After event2 event1 must happen is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Let s0 = initial state, s1 = next state, s2 = next after that, etc.

Evaluate:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 this asserts event2 at s1. But no events occur after s0, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At s0 this requires C1 to be true at s1, i.e. event2 at s2. But event2 never occurs, so C1 is false at s1 and thus C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false at s0, C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds at s0 (and event1 already happened), so C4 is true at s0.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" We must check C4 at every future state. The same reasoning (no events ever occur) makes C2 false at all states, hence C3 true at every state, hence C4 true at every state. So C5 is true at s0.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 (C4 always holds) is true at every state (the invariant argument above works from any state), C6 is true at s0.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is true at s1, so C7 is true at s0.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" C7 is true at s1 (because C6 is true at s2, etc.), so C8 is true at s0.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" C8 already holds at s0 (and at all states), so C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the chain C1…C8.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, this rules out any occurrence of event2 at any future state.
- After event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant because event2 will never occur given the previous point.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions step by step (interpret next = “in the next state”, always = “at all states”)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” False, because event2 cannot happen after the initial event1.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” This asserts that event2 happens two states ahead; also false for the same reason.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 is false, C3 is true (and in fact true at every state, because event2 is impossible anywhere).
- C4: “C3 holds or event1 happens.” Since C3 is true, C4 is true (and true at every state).
- C5: “C4 always holds.” True, because C4 is true at every state.
- C6: “C5 always holds.” True (C5 is a global property that holds at every state).
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” True, because C6 holds at every state.
- C8: “C7 holds in the next state.” True for the same reason (C7 holds at every state).
- C9: “C8 eventually holds.” True, because C8 already holds now (hence holds eventually).

Final answer:
True
---
The hypothesis asks whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Summary of the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no event2 can ever occur in any future state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Evaluate the Ci one by one (truth values are at the initial state, unless a formula itself talks about other states):

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False, because after the initial event1 no events (and thus no event2) can occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That requires C1 to be true one step further; since C1 is false in every state, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True, because C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" True (C3 holds; event1 also happened initially).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True: C4 is true in every state because C3 (= not C2) is true in every state (C2 is false everywhere since C1 is never true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True (C5 is true in every state).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" True (C6 is true everywhere, so in the next state as well).
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" True (same reason: C7 is true everywhere).
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" True — C8 already holds (in fact in every state), so it holds eventually.

First, the question: we must decide whether C8 (C2 holds or C7 holds) is true in the given scenario.

Interpretation / assumptions:
- ""Initially, event1 happened"" means at the initial state event1 holds.
- ""Event1 eventually happens"" (used in C1/C5) is the usual temporal ""eventually"" (F): it is true at a state if event1 holds at that state or at some future state.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred at a state, there are no future states where any event occurs (so event1 occurs at the initial state and does not occur again later).
- We evaluate the Ci formulas at the initial state unless otherwise stated. ""C6 holds in the next state"" (C7) refers to truth of C6 at the immediate successor state.

Step-by-step evaluation (at the initial state, call it time 0):
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True at time 0 because event1 holds at time 0.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 holds at time 0 and C1 is true, so C2 is true at time 0.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true at time 0.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true at time 0, C4 is false at time 0.
- C5: same as C1, so C5 is true at time 0.

Now consider the next state (time 1). Because no events can happen after event1, event1 does not hold at time 1 and will not hold in any future state:
- At time 1, C1 (event1 eventually happens) is false (event1 already occurred only at time 0, not at or after time 1).
- At time 1, C3 (""event1 happens and C1"") is false (event1 does not happen at time 1).
- Therefore at time 1, C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.
- At time 1, C5 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.
- So at time 1, C6 (""if C4 then C5"") is false because C4 true and C5 false.
- C7 asserts ""C6 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C6 at time 1). We found C6 false at time 1, so C7 is false at time 0.

Finally:
- C8 = (C2 holds) or (C7 holds). At time 0 C2 is true, C7 is false, so the disjunction C8 is true.

Answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happened initially. Also after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 never occurs.  
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true because event1 already happened.  
- C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true (event1 happened and C1 true).  
- C3 is identical to C2, so C3 is true; hence C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.  
- C5 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true (same as C1).  
- C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is true as a material implication because C4 is false.

Sample responses:
You're being asked whether C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step:

- Context fixes the sequence: initially event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen. So every execution has event2 (initially) followed by event1 and then termination.
- Therefore ""event2 happens"" is true in all executions, so ""Event2 always happens"" (C1 and C4) is true.
- C2 and C3 (which are ""C1 holds and event2 happens"") are therefore true.
- C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is true (both disjuncts are true).
- C6 (""C2 holds or C5 holds"") is true.
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true because C6 follows from facts that hold in every execution.
- C8 asserts ""C7 does not hold"", but C7 does hold, so C8 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C8 says ""C7 does not hold."" We must decide if C7 is false given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition using the context
Context facts: initially event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false. The context only ensures event2 happened initially (and does not imply event2 holds at all times).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" False, because C1 is false (even though event2 did happen initially).
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: same as C1, so false.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts false → C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both false → C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false (it does not hold), C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So every allowed execution (trace) is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the context, event2 happens in every trace (it happens initially), so C1 is true.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is true and event2 does happen, so C2 is true.

- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.

- C4: same as C1, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since both are true, C5 is true.

- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Since both are true, C6 is true.

- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true (and thus holds in all states/traces of the system), so C7 is true.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This contradicts the conclusion that C7 is true, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False."

First, what is being asked:
- We must determine whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Understand the conditions (brief):
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. in every state, event2 happens in the next state)
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds.""
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" (identical to C3)
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" (C3 → C4)
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" (C5 is true in every state)
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state.""

Key observations and reasoning:
1. The context about events (initial event2, after event2 event1 must happen, after event1 no further events) may make C2 false (C1 does not hold in every state), but that does not affect the logical structure below.
2. C3 and C4 are syntactically identical (""Event2 happens and C2 holds""). Therefore the implication C5 (C3 → C4) is a tautology: p → p is always true in every state.
3. Because C5 is true in every state, C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true.
4. If C6 is true (globally), then in particular it holds in the next state. Hence C7 is true.

Conclusion:
C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- From the context: initially event2 happened and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Therefore the next state after event2 must have event1, not event2. So C1 is False.

Step 2 — propagate to C2–C4:
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is False.
- C3 and C4: both are ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Because C2 is False, both C3 and C4 are False.

Step 3 — C5 and C6:
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 and C4 are the same formula, so the implication is a tautology (true whenever evaluated); in particular, with C3 false the implication is vacuously true. So C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is true in every state, C6 is True.

Step 4 — C7:
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Because C6 is true in every state, it holds in the next state as well. So C7 is True.

Final answer:
True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C8 says “C7 holds in the next state.” We evaluate C8 at the initial state (t0). So C8 at t0 is true iff C7 is true at t1.

Step 2 — understand the context and map to states
Initially (t0) event2 happens. The context rules say:
- After event2, event1 must happen → whenever event2 occurs at some state, the next state has event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen → they alternate: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, …

Step 3 — examine the hypothesis components at t1
C1: “If event2 happens, then event1 happens.” This matches the context and therefore holds at every state (including t1 and t2).
C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” At t1, C2 asks whether C1 holds at t2. Since C1 holds at every state, C2 is true at t1.
C3 is the same as C1, hence true at t1. C4 is the same as C2, hence true at t1. C5 = C3 or C4 is therefore true at t1. C6: “If event1 happens, then C5 holds.” At t1 event1 does happen and we already saw C5 is true, so C6 is true at t1. C7 = C2 or C6 is true at t1 (in fact both disjuncts are true).

Step 4 — conclude C8 at t0
C7 is true at t1, so C8 (“C7 holds in the next state”) is true at t0.

Final answer: True
---

---
Identify goal
- We must decide whether C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Interpret the context
- The context gives two global rules: whenever event2 happens then event1 must happen, and whenever event1 happens then event2 must happen. These are invariants that hold at all states.
- Initially event2 happened, so the next state will have event1, then the next will have event2, etc. (an alternating sequence).

Examine the hypothesis step by step
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" — this matches one of the context rules, so C1 is true at the current state (and by the invariant, at all states).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" — since C1 is an invariant, it also holds in the next state, so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so true.
- C4: same as C2, so true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since C3 is true, C5 is true.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" C5 is already true, so C6 is true (the implication is true because the consequent is true).
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" Both C2 and C6 are true, so C7 is true at the current state.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" Because the rules (and thus C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7) are invariant across states and the next state indeed contains event1 (which doesn't invalidate any of the above), C7 also holds in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We want to decide whether C8 (C6 holds or C7 holds) is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events can occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event2 would force event1 to occur afterward).

Step-by-step evaluation of the Ci:

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Since event1 already happens initially and after event1 no further events can occur, event2 cannot happen anywhere. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false, and it cannot become true later (event2 cannot occur), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C1 is false. So C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is true and there is no way to make C1 true (event2 cannot happen after initial event1), C5 holds in all states; thus C6 is true.
- C7: ""C2 holds in the next state."" As above, C2 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" C6 is true, so the disjunction is true (even though C7 is false).

Therefore C8 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has happened (so the initial state satisfies event1).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 occurs there are no further events in any future state → in particular event2 cannot occur in any state after the initial one. Since event1 is true initially, there are no states in which a new event can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is then irrelevant here because event2 never occurs; the implication is vacuously satisfied.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False (C2 is false; also there is no meaningful next state with events).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False (C3 is false and will not become true).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" True (implication is vacuously true because C1 is false).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True (C5 holds in the only relevant state(s); there are no counterexamples).
- C7: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False (same as C3).
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" True (C6 is true, so the disjunction is true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur at any later state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (see previous point).

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci statements
- C1 and C2: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given event1 happened initially but no events can happen afterwards, event2 never occurs. So C1 and C2 are false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False (C3 never holds).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C1 never holds.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True — C5 holds in every state (vacuously).
- C7: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" Since C6 is true, C8 is true.

Goal: decide whether C9 is true given the context.

Interpretation and model:
- Time is a sequence of states. Initially (time 0) event1 holds.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating sequence: event1 at time 0, event2 at time 1, event1 at time 2, etc.

Evaluate the Ci at time 0 (initial state):
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is true at time 0 (event1 holds).
- C2: same as C1, so true at time 0.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true at time 0, C3 is false at time 0.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false at time 0.
- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds."" At time 0 C1 is true and C5 is false, so C6 is false at time 0.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" At time 1, C1 is false (event1 does not hold) so the implication C6 (C1 → C5) is vacuously true at time 1; thus C6 holds at time 1, so C7 is true at time 0.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 already holds at time 0, so C8 is true at time 0.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" C8 is true at time 0, so C9 is true at time 0.

Conclusion: C9 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the context as LTL-like rules with ""after"" meaning ""in the next state"":
   - Initially S0: event1 holds.
   - G(event1 -> X event2) and G(event2 -> X event1), so states alternate: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, ...

2. Evaluate the Ci formulas along that run:
   - C1 = (event1 and event1) ≡ event1. So C1 holds in S0 (and in every event1-state S2, S4,...).
   - C2 = same as C1, so C2 holds in S0.
   - C3 = not C2. So C3 is false in S0 but true in S1 (where event1 is false).
   - C4 = eventually C3. From S0, S1 satisfies C3, so C4 is true at S0.
   - C5 = not C4. Since C4 is true at S0, C5 is false at S0.
   - C6 = (C1 -> C5). At S0, C1 is true and C5 is false, so C6 is false at S0. At S1, C1 is false (event1 false), so C6 is true at S1 (implication vacuously true).
   - C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" = X C6. At S0, C6 holds at S1, so C7 is true at S0.
   - C8 = eventually C7. C7 already holds at S0, so C8 is true at S0.
   - C9 = eventually C8. C8 holds at S0, so C9 is true at S0.

Therefore C9 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 happens initially, and event1 and event2 alternate thereafter. So event1 does occur (in fact infinitely often).

2. Interpret the basic claims:
   - C1, C2, C4 are all the same statement: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, that statement is false.
   - C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. the negation of C2 — so C3 is true (because C2 is false): event1 does happen.

3. C5 = C3 or C4 = (not C2) or C4. Since C4 is the same as C2, C5 is (not C2) or C2, which is a tautology — it is true (indeed true at all times).

4. C6 = ""C5 eventually holds."" Because C5 holds now (indeed always), C6 holds.

5. C7 = C1 or C6. C1 is false but C6 is true, so C7 holds.

6. C8 = ""C7 eventually holds."" Since C7 already holds (indeed at all times), C8 holds.

7. C9 = ""C8 always holds."" We just established C8 holds (in fact at every time), so C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.

Assumptions about semantics (standard LTL-style reading):
- ""Event1 does not happen"" at a state means ¬event1 holds at that state.
- ""C eventually holds"" means C holds at some current or future state.
- ""C always holds"" means C holds at every state.

Step-by-step:

1. C1 and C2 are both the state formula ¬event1 (they duplicate).
2. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 = event1 (i.e. event1 holds at the current state).
3. C4 is again ¬event1.
4. C5 = C3 ∨ C4 = (event1) ∨ (¬event1), which is a tautology — true at every state.
5. C6 = ""C5 eventually holds"". Since C5 is true right now at every state, ""eventually C5"" is true at every state, so C6 holds everywhere.
6. C7 = C1 ∨ C6. Because C6 holds everywhere, C7 holds at every state.
7. C8 = ""C7 eventually holds"". Since C7 already holds now at every state, C8 is true at every state.
8. C9 = ""C8 always holds"". Because C8 holds at every state, C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True. Final answer: True"

Sample responses:
We evaluate each condition starting from the initial state where event2 happened and no further events can occur.

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" After event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state in which event1 could occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is false, but event2 did happen initially, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so C4 is true.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" C8 is true, so C9 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen — so once event2 has happened, no future state will have any event occur.

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state (where event2 just happened) there are no further events, so C1 is false.

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false in the initial state, C2 is false.

- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" In the initial state event2 does happen, so C3 is true (true because of event2).

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" In the next state, event2 no longer happens and C2 is false, so C3 does not hold in that next state and will never hold thereafter (no further events). Therefore C4 is false in the next state, so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is true, so C7 is false.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" C8 is true, so C9 is false.

Thus C9 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial state s0: event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen, so in the next state s1 no events occur.
- C1 (event1 in next state): at s0 this is false (event1 does not happen in s1).
- C2 (always C1): at s0 this is false because C1 is already false at s0.
- C3 (C2 or event2): at s0 this is true because event2 happened at s0.
- C4 (eventually C3): at s0 this is true (C3 holds now).
- C5 (C4 holds in the next state): at s0 this asks whether C4 holds at s1. At s1, no events occur, and C3 is false there, so C4 is false at s1. Thus C5 is false at s0.
- C6 (C5 does not hold): true at s0.
- C7 (C6 does not hold): false at s0 (negation of true).
- C8 (C7 does not hold): true at s0 (negation of false).
- C9 (C8 does not hold): false at s0 (negation of true).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 is true and event1 cannot occur afterward — therefore event1 does not happen.
2. C1 (event2 and event1): false (event1 is false).
3. C2 (event2 and event1): false.
4. C3 (if C1 then C2): true, because an implication with a false antecedent is true.
5. C4 (event2 and event1): false.
6. C5 (if C3 then C4): false, because C3 is true but C4 is false.
7. C6 (event2 and event1): false.
8. C7 (C5 or C6): false (both disjuncts false).
9. C8 (C7 always holds): false (C7 does not hold).
10. C9 (C8 does not hold): true (since C8 is false).

Thus C9 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Let p = “Event2 happens and Event1 happens.”
- From the context: Event2 happens initially, and after Event2 no other events can happen — so Event1 cannot also happen. Therefore p is false.
- Evaluate the Ci:
  - C1 = p → false.
  - C2 = p → false.
  - C3 = “If C1 holds then C2 holds” = (p → p). An implication p→p is true, so C3 is true.
  - C4 = p → false.
  - C5 = “If C3 holds then C4 holds” = (true → false) → false.
  - C6 = p → false.
  - C7 = C5 ∨ C6 = false ∨ false = false.
  - C8 = “C7 always holds” — since C7 is false, C8 is false.
  - C9 = “C8 does not hold” = true.

Thus C9 is True.
---
Step 1 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 cannot happen (there is no time for it after the initial event2, and nothing happened before).

So: event2 happens is true; event1 happens is false.

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci one by one
- C1 (event2 and event1): false (event1 is false).
- C2 (same as C1): false.
- C3 (if C1 then C2): true. (This is p -> p, which is always true in classical logic.)
- C4 (event2 and event1): false.
- C5 (if C3 then C4): false, because C3 is true but C4 is false (true -> false = false).
- C6 (event2 and event1): false.
- C7 (C5 or C6): false (both disjuncts false).
- C8 (C7 always holds): false (C7 does not hold).
- C9 (C8 does not hold): true (C8 is false, so ""C8 does not hold"" is true).

Final answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context summary: The initial state has event1. After event1 (and after event2) no other states/events can occur — i.e. the trace terminates immediately after the initial state.

2. C1: ""Event1 or event2"" — true in the initial state because event1 happened.

3. C2: ""If event1 then C1"" — a propositional tautology (event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2)), so true in every state where it's evaluated.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is true in every (existing) state, C3 is true in the initial state.

5. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — requires a next state. But the context says there is no next state after the initial state (trace ends after event1). Under standard temporal semantics the next-state formula is false at a terminal state. Therefore C4 is false.

6. Because C4 is never true, C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false, and therefore the subsequent claims C6, C7 (which depend on C5/C6 in next states) are false.

7. C8 is the same as C1 and is true in the initial state, but C9 is C7 ∧ C8. Since C7 is false, C9 is false.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
1. From the context, events alternate: after any event1 there is an event2, and after any event2 there is an event1. Therefore the implication in C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is true at all times.
2. If C1 is true now (indeed always), then ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true.
3. C3 says ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 already holds, so C3 is true whenever event2 happens (in fact globally true).
4. C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.
5. C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" Because C4 is false, C5 is true.
6. C6 says ""C5 always holds."" C5 is true now and remains true, so C6 is true.
7. From C6 being always true, C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true.
8. Similarly, C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is true.
9. Finally, C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is true.

Thus C9 is True.

We are asked whether C8 (""If C2 holds, then C7 holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step-by-step evaluation:

- From the context: event1 happens initially. Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Therefore both event1 and event2 do happen. So:
  - event1 is true
  - event2 is true

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event1 does happen, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is false, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

- C8 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C7 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false) is vacuously true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: initially event1 happened, and event1 and event2 force each other to occur afterward. In particular, event1 does happen.
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2 and C3 are ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 is ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" — C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold"" — therefore C5 is true.
- C6 is ""Event1 happens or C5 holds"" — event1 does happen, so C6 is true.
- C7 is ""C6 does not hold"" — thus C7 is false.
- C8 is ""If C2 holds, then C7 holds."" C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C8 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event2 has occurred, and ""after event2, event1 must happen"", so at the initial state event1 will occur in the next state. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen.""

2. C1 and C2 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") are true at the initial state. Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is true at the initial state.

3. C4 (""C3 always holds"") requires C3 to hold at every state. At the state after event1, there are no further events, so ""event1 happens in the next state"" is false there; therefore C3 does not hold at that later state, and C4 is false.

4. C6 (""If C4 holds then C5 holds"") is true (its antecedent C4 is false). Thus C6 holds at the initial state (and also afterward, since C4 remains false).

5. C7 (""If C6 holds then event1 happens"") is true at the initial state (because C6 holds there and event1 does indeed occur next), but at the state after event1 C6 still holds while event1 does not occur afterward, so C7 is false at that later state.

6. C8 (""C7 always holds"") is therefore false (C7 fails at the state after event1).

7. C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true."

Reasoning

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after any event1 there must be an event2, and after any event2 there must be an event1. So events alternate indefinitely: event1 → event2 → event1 → ...
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens""): true because after the initial event1 an event2 must occur.
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds""): true (both disjuncts actually hold: event1 happened initially and C1 holds).
- C3 and C4 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens""): since C2 is true and the system forces an event2 after event1, these implications are satisfied, so C3 and C4 are true.
- C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds""): true because both C3 and C4 hold.
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds""): true because C5 already holds (and continues to hold), so it certainly holds at some future point.
- C7 (""C6 always holds""): true because at every moment C5 will hold (the facts above persist under the enforced alternation), hence at every moment C6 — “C5 eventually holds” — is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. From the context: initially event1 has happened, and the rules force alternation — after every event1 there will be an event2, and after every event2 there will be an event1. So event2 will occur (in fact infinitely often).

2. C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true.

3. C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true now because event1 already happened (and also because C1 is true).

4. C3 and C4 (""if C2 holds then event2 happens"") are true: whenever C2 holds (either because event1 has just happened or because C1 is true), the system ensures an event2 occurs afterward. (If C2 were true only because C1 already holds, the consequent is trivially satisfied; if C2 is true because event1 happened, the rule guarantees event2.)

5. C5 (C3 or C4) is therefore true.

6. C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") holds now (and immediately) because C5 already holds.

7. The rules are invariant over time (the alternation continues forever), so the same reasoning applies at every future time: C3/C4 remain true, hence C5 remains true, hence C6 holds at every time.

Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context gives an infinite alternation starting from event1: event1 happens, then event2 must happen, then event1 must happen, etc. So event2 does occur (indeed infinitely often).
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true.
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true (C1 holds, and event1 also happened initially).
- C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is true because C2 does hold and, by the context, event2 will happen after event1 and repeatedly thereafter. The implication is therefore satisfied.
- C4 is the same as C3, so it is also true. Hence C5 (C3 or C4) is true.
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true because C5 already holds (in fact holds always), so it will certainly hold at some future point.
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true because C6 holds at every point in the execution.

Therefore C7 is True."

Step 1 — what’s asked:
C9 is the statement ""If C7 holds, then C8 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context and key conditions:
- The context says: whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterward. That is exactly C1 (and C8) — so C1 and C8 are true.
- Because C8 (event2 → event1) is true, any implication whose consequent is C8 is true regardless of the antecedent’s truth.

Step 3 — check consequences:
- Even if we evaluate the other Cs (C2–C7), they don’t contradict C8; in fact C1/C8 already hold from the context.
- Therefore C9 (C7 → C8) has a true consequent, so the implication C9 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — use the context about events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so there are no further event occurrences; in particular, event1 never happens.

Step 2 — evaluate each claim
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p); it holds now (and everywhere).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Either there is no next state (so Next(...) is false) or, if there were, C5 is false there; in any case C6 is false.
- C7: ""C1 eventually holds."" Already true (C1 holds now), so C7 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C8
- C8 is ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" C6 is false but C7 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the background
- We start in a state where event2 has happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so this state has no successor (no next state).

Step 2 — interpret the formulas
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p -> p) and is true in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now, ""eventually C1"" is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts the negation of C2, but C2 is true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" That requires C3 to be true in all states; C3 is already false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Same reasoning: C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (terminal), so the next-state claim is false.
- C7: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2, true.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" That is (false) or (true) = true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpret the statements in temporal logic:
  - C1: (event1 → event1) — a propositional tautology, true in every state.
  - C2: F C1 — ""C1 eventually holds"". Since C1 is true now (indeed everywhere), C2 is true.
  - C3: ¬C2 — therefore false (because C2 is true).
  - C4: G C3 — ""C3 always holds"" — false (C3 is false now).
  - C5: G C4 — false (C4 is false).
  - C6: X C5 — false (C5 is false, so it does not hold in the next state).
  - C7: F C1 — same as C2, so true.
  - C8: C6 ∨ C7 — false ∨ true = true.

- The contextual rules about events do not change that C1 is a tautology, so C7 is true and thus C8 is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C8 (""If C6 holds, then C7 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""event1 or event1"" ≡ event1.
- C2: ""event1 or event1"" ≡ event1.
- C4: ""event1 or event1"" ≡ event1.
- C3: ""If C1 then C2"" ≡ If event1 then event1 — this is a tautology, so C3 is true whenever C1 is defined.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" ≡ event1 holds in the next state.
- C7: same as C5 (C4 holds in the next state).
- C6: C3 and C5 ≡ (true) and (event1 in the next state) ≡ event1 in the next state.

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened, so C1, C2, C4 are true in the initial state.
- The context states: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore there is no next state in which event1 happens; in particular, event1 does not hold in the next state. So C5 and C7 are false.

Step 4 — evaluate C6 and C8
- C6 = C3 and C5 = true and false = false.
- C8 is the implication ""If C6 then C7"". An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify propositions
- Let p mean “Event1 happens.”  
- C1, C2, C4 are all simply p (they are “Event1 happens or Event1 happens”).  
- C3 is (C1 → C2), i.e. (p → p).  
- C5 and C7 are “C4 holds in the next state”, i.e. X p (next p).  
- C6 is (C3 ∧ C5), i.e. (p → p) ∧ X p, which simplifies to True ∧ X p = X p.  
- C8 is (C6 → C7), i.e. (X p → X p).

Step 2 — evaluate each
- (p → p) is a tautology (always true), so C3 is true.  
- C6 reduces to X p (it holds exactly when the next-state p holds).  
- C8 is the implication X p → X p, which is identically true (an instance of A → A).

Step 3 — role of the context
- The context (event1 happens initially and no further events occur) might make X p false, but that doesn't matter: an implication A → A is true whether A is true or false.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C8 (""If C6 holds, then C7 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen (so there is no successor state with any event happening). After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here since event2 did not occur).
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1 happens. So C1 holds in the initial state.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 holds in the initial state.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" is the tautology ""if event1 then event1"", so C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4: again ""event1 happens"" — true in the initial state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" means ""event1 holds in the next state."" But by the context, after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no next state where event1 holds (either there is no next state, or the next state exists but event1 does not hold there). In standard temporal semantics X p is false when there is no next state, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds"" — since C3 is true but C5 is false, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C4 holds in the next state"" is the same as C5 and is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C8
- C8: ""If C6 holds, then C7 holds."" The antecedent C6 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1 is just ""event2"" (a tautological repetition).
- C2 is ""event2 eventually holds"" — not needed further, but defined.
- C3 and C4 are identical: ""event1 or C2"".
- C5 is ""if C3 then C4"". Since C3 and C4 are the same formula, C5 is A -> A, which is a tautology and therefore true in every state.
- C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state"". Because C5 is true in every state, C5 is true in every next state as well, so C6 is true in every state.
- C7 is ""C6 always holds"". Since C6 is true in every state, C7 is true.

(The given background about events is unnecessary for this conclusion; the crucial point is that C5 is identically true.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the scenario and states
- Let S0 be the initial state (event1 happened).
- By the context, S1 must follow S0 (event2 happens).
- After event2 no other events can happen, so S1 is terminal (no S2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — trivially equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" — true on this trace because C1 holds in S1.
- C3 and C4: both are ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"". They are the same formula, so call it A.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" is A -> A, which is a tautology and therefore holds in every state (both S0 and S1).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). 
  - In S0 this is true because the next state is S1 and C5 holds in S1.
  - In S1 this is false because S1 is terminal (there is no next state), so X C5 is false under standard next-state semantics for finite traces.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" (G C6). This requires C6 to be true in every state. Because C6 is false in S1, C7 is false.

Conclusion
C7 is False.

- From the initial event2, it follows that event1 will (eventually) happen. So ""event1 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C9
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true.
- Since ""event1 happens"" is true, the disjunction ""C8 holds or event1 happens"" is true regardless of C8.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context: initially event2 happened and ""after event2, event1 must happen"", so event1 does happen (at least once). Thus ""event1 happens"" is true.
- C9 is the disjunction ""C8 holds or event1 happens"". Since event1 happens is already true, the disjunction is true.
- (Also, C8 is one of the given premises, so C8 itself holds; that alone would also make the disjunction true.)"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false: event1 occurs initially and then alternates with event2, so event1 does not hold at all times (it is false at times when event2 occurs).
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true (vacuously): since C1 is false, the implication C1 → event1 is true.
- Event1 does happen (initially), and C2 is true, so C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true.
- C6 is identical to C3, so C6 is also true.
- C7 is ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" Because C6 is true, the disjunction C7 is true regardless of C5.

Therefore C7 = True.
---
We evaluate these at the initial time (when ""Initially, event1 happened"").

1) Timeline from the context:
- t0: event1 happens (given).
- After event1, event2 must happen → t1: event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen → t2: event1 happens, and so on (they alternate).

2) Evaluate the conditions at t0:
- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): false (event1 does not hold at t1, t3, ...).
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens""): true — an implication with a false antecedent (C1) is true.
- C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds""): true at t0, since event1 is true at t0 and C2 is true.
- C4 (""C3 always holds""): false, because at t1 event1 is false so C3 fails there.
- C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens""): at t0 both disjuncts are false (C4 false, event2 is not happening at t0) → C5 false at t0.
- C6 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds""): identical to C3, so true at t0.
- C7 (""C5 holds or C6 holds""): since C6 is true at t0, C7 is true at t0.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context, event1 occurs initially and the rules force event2 to occur after event1 and event1 to occur after event2. So both event1 and event2 do occur (they alternate), but event1 is not true at every moment.

- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false (event1 does not hold at all times).

- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true (the implication is true whether C1 is false or, if C1 were true, event1 would indeed happen).

- C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true (event1 does happen at least initially and C2 holds).

- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false (that would require event1 to always hold, which it does not).

- C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens"") is true because event2 does happen.

- C6 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds"") is the same as C3, so true.

- C7 (""C5 holds or C6 holds"") is therefore true (both disjuncts are true)."

We want to know whether C7 (""If C4 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context: initially event1 has happened. After event1 no other events can happen. (Also: ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.)
- C1: ""event1 or event2 happens.""
- C2 and C3: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — both require that in the immediate next state either event1 or event2 occurs.
- Because after the initial event1 no further events can occur, in the next state neither event1 nor event2 occurs. So C2 and C3 are false. Hence C4 = C2 and C3 is false.
- C5 is the same as C2/C3 (""C1 holds in the next state""), so C5 is false and therefore C6 (""eventually C5"") is also false (C5 never becomes true later).
- C7 is the implication ""if C4 then C6."" Since C4 is never true in any allowed execution, the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
1. From the context: event1 occurs initially. After event1 no other events can occur. Therefore in the immediate next state there are no events (neither event1 nor event2).
2. C1 is ""event1 or event2 happens."" C1 is true in the initial state (because event1 happened initially) but C1 is false in the next state (no events happen there).
3. C2 and C3 assert C1 holds in the next state — both are false (since C1 is false in the next state). Thus C4 = C2 and C3 is false.
4. C5 is again ""C1 holds in the next state"" — false. So C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is also false (there is never a future state where C1 holds in the next state).
5. C7 is the implication ""If C4 holds, then C6 holds."" Since C4 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C9.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So no event2 can occur after the initial event1.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant since event2 never occurs here.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
  - In the actual situation event1 did happen but event2 does not (no events can follow event1). So C1 is false.
- C2: C1 does not hold.
  - Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.
  - C2 is already true, so the implication ""event2 → C2"" is true (it holds whether or not event2 happens). Thus C3 is true.
- C4: C3 always holds.
  - C3 is true now and nothing causes it to become false later (no further events change facts), so C4 is true.
- C5: C4 always holds.
  - Same reasoning, C5 is true.
- C6: C5 always holds.
  - True as well.
- C7: C6 eventually holds.
  - If something always holds, it certainly holds now, so it is true that it eventually holds. Hence C7 is true.
- C8: C7 eventually holds.
  - C7 already holds, so C8 is true.
- C9: C8 eventually holds.
  - C8 already holds, so C9 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C9 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So event2 does not happen (it cannot occur after event1).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Event1 does happen but event2 does not, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is true, so the implication is true regardless of whether event2 happens; therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true (and does not depend on future events), so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" If C4 is true, then C4 always holds, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Same reasoning gives C6 true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" If C6 always holds, it certainly eventually holds, so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" Since C7 holds (indeed holds now), C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" Since C8 holds, C9 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — understand the setting
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So event1 occurs at the initial moment, and event2 does not occur at any time (since once event1 occurs, nothing else can occur).
- (The clause ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 does happen but event2 does not, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Because C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 never happens, so this implication is vacuously true whenever evaluated.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true at every time (vacuously), so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True for the same reason; C4 holding always makes C5 true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" If C6 holds at all times, it certainly holds at some time, so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 is already true, so C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" C8 is true, so C9 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context about events
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen → events alternate, so event2 does occur (indeed repeatedly).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: (event2 → event2) is a tautology; it holds.
- C2: same as C1; it holds.
- C3: C1 or C2 holds. Since C1 holds, C3 holds.
- C4: (if C3 then event2). C3 holds and event2 does happen, so the implication C4 is true.
- C5: (event2 → event2) is a tautology; it holds.
- C6: (if C4 then C5). C4 holds, so C6 yields C5 — but C5 already holds anyway.
- C7: (event2 → event2) holds.
- C8: C6 or C7 holds. Both hold, so C8 holds now.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" Since C8 holds already, it certainly eventually holds.

Conclusion
- C9 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so event2 does happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 happens again, and this alternation continues. Crucially, event2 does occur (immediately after the initial event1 and repeatedly thereafter).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 holds (true), and from the context event2 does indeed happen, so the implication is true; therefore C4 holds.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Again a tautology, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 holds and C5 holds, so C6 is true.
- C7: another tautology like C1/C2/C5, so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" Both hold, so C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" Since C8 already holds (true now), it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually). So C9 is true.

Conclusion
- C9 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- C1, C2, C5, C7 are all tautologies of the form (event2 → event2), so each is true.
- C3 = C1 ∨ C2 is therefore true.
- From the context: event1 happened initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" implies event2 does happen. Given C3 is true and C4 is (C3 → event2), C4 is true (its antecedent holds and its consequent holds).
- C6 is (C4 → C5); since C4 is true and C5 is true, C6 is true.
- C8 = C6 ∨ C7 is thus true.
- C9 asserts ""C8 eventually holds."" C8 already holds, so it certainly eventually holds.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C9 is true.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus event1 occurs at the start and no event can occur after that. In particular, event2 does not occur (there is no time before the initial moment to have event2; and it cannot occur after event1).

Now evaluate the conditions step by step:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" False, because event2 does not happen.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" False (C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" False (C2 is already false at the initial moment).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" False.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens."" False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" True, because C6 is false.
- C8: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Same as C1, so False.
- C9: ""C7 holds or C8 holds."" True OR False = True.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the background
- Initially event1 happened. So at the initial moment event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 happens; but given event1 already happened initially, event2 cannot happen later.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Event1 did happen (initially). Event2 cannot happen (because event1 already happened and prevents any other events), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is already false now and cannot become true (it requires event2), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never becomes true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens."" C5 is false and event2 cannot happen, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.
- C8: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Same as C1, false.
- C9: ""C7 holds or C8 holds."" C7 is true (C8 is false), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Goal: decide whether C9 is True or False.

Context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

From the context: event1 happens and (because it happens initially) no other events can occur afterwards. Therefore event2 does not happen at any time.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (event2 and event1): false (event2 does not occur).
- C2 (C1 and event1): false (C1 false).
- C3 (always C2): false.
- C4 (always C3): false.
- C5 (eventually C4): false.
- C6 (C5 and event2): false.
- C7 (C6 does not hold): true (since C6 is false).
- C8 (event2 and event1): same as C1, false.
- C9 (C7 or C8): true or false = true (C7 is true).

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C9 (""If C7 holds, then C8 holds"") is true given the context and the listed Ci.

Given context:
- event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So event2 does not happen.)

Evaluate the Ci step by step:
1. event1 is true; event2 is false (it cannot happen after event1).
2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" True (antecedent false, or in fact event1 is true).
3. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Antecedent true and C1 true, so C2 is true.
4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (since C2 holds).
5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (because C3 is false).
6. C5: same as C1, true.
7. C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" True (both true).
8. C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" True (event1 is true).
9. C8: same as C1 and C5, true.

Finally C9: ""If C7 holds, then C8 holds."" Antecedent C7 is true and consequent C8 is true, so the implication is true.

Answer:
True
---
Reasoning:

- From context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 does not happen.
- C1 (event2 → event1): true, because event2 is false so the implication holds vacuously.
- C2 (event1 → C1): event1 is true and C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3 (¬C2): false, since C2 is true.
- C4 (¬C3): true, since C3 is false.
- C5 (event2 → event1): same as C1, true.
- C6 (C4 ∧ C5): true ∧ true = true.
- C7 (event1 ∨ C6): event1 is true, so C7 is true.
- C8 (event2 → event1): same as C1, true.
- C9 (C7 → C8): C7 is true and C8 is true, so the implication is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 = True.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no other events (including event2) can happen after event1; since event1 is initial, event2 never happens. Thus event2 = False.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" With event2 False, the implication is vacuously true. So C1 = True.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" event1 is True and C1 is True, so C2 = True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 holds, so C3 = False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is False, so C4 = True.
- C5: same as C1, True (vacuously).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both True, so C6 = True.
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" Event1 is True, so C7 = True.
- C8: same implication again, True.

Step 3 — C9: ""If C7 holds, then C8 holds."" C7 is True and C8 is True, so the implication is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1, C2, C3 are the same proposition: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
2. C4 = C2 or C3. Since C2 and C3 are both C1, C4 is equivalent to C1.
3. C5 = C2 or C3, so C5 is also equivalent to C1.
4. C6 = C4 and C5. With C4 and C5 both equivalent to C1, C6 is equivalent to C1 (C1 and C1 ↔ C1).
5. C7 is the implication C1 → C6. Substituting the equivalence gives C1 → C1, which is a tautology (always true).

Therefore C7 is True (independent of the event constraints in the context).
---
Reasoning:

- The hypothesis formulas: C1, C2, C3 all assert the same thing: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C4 = (C2 or C3) is therefore equivalent to C1.
- C5 = (C2 or C3) is also equivalent to C1.
- C6 = (C4 and C5) is thus equivalent to (C1 and C1), i.e. C1.
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" which reduces to ""If C1 then C1"" — a logical tautology.

The context about events does not change that C7 is logically valid: whether C1 is true or false, the implication C1 → C6 holds (vacuously true if C1 is false, true if C1 is true since C6 = C1).

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1, C2 and C3 are the same statement (""Event1 happens in the next state""). So if C1 holds then C2 and C3 also hold.
- From C2 and C3 holding, C4 = (C2 or C3) and C5 = (C2 or C3) both hold, so C6 = C4 and C5 holds.
- Therefore whenever C1 holds, C6 holds; and if C1 does not hold the implication is vacuously true. Hence C7 is True."

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let s0 be the initial (and only) state. event2 is true at s0. Because “after event2, no other events can happen,” there is no successor state.

- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — true at s0.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — true at s0 (C1 already holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — false (C2 is true).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — false (C3 is false at s0).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — true (C4 is false).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — false, because there is no next state, so X C5 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — true (C6 is false).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — false (C7 is true).
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" — false, again because there is no next state, so X C8 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initial facts: event2 has happened, and after event2 no further events can occur. So the only reachable state is the initial one where event2 is true.

- C1: ""event2 and event2"" — equivalent to event2, so C1 is true in the initial state.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — holds immediately (in the current state), so C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — false, because C2 is true.

- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — false, since C3 is already false in the initial state.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — true, because C4 is false.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5) — there is no next state (after event2 no further events), so X C5 is false.

- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — true, since C6 is false.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — false, since C7 is true.

- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" (X C8) — again there is no next state, so X C8 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — translate the context
- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened (and it happens initially), no event2 can occur at any later time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never actually occurs given the above.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" is a tautology (p → p). It is true at every point (vacuously true when event2 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds immediately (everywhere), C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4 and C5: same tautology as C1, so both hold.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" Both disjuncts are true, so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C2 holds and C7 holds."" Both C2 and C7 are true, so C8 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   From this, event1 has already happened initially and no further events (including event2) can occur after that; in particular, there is no obligation forcing event2 to ever occur.

2. Understand each condition:
   - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 is true whenever evaluated.
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true now (indeed always), it certainly holds at some time (now), so C2 is true.
   - C3: Same as C2 (it repeats), so C3 is true.
   - C4 and C5: Both are the same tautology as C1, so both hold.
   - C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Because C4 and C5 are true, this implication is true.
   - C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" Since C3 is true (and C6 is also true), C7 is true.
   - C8: ""C2 holds and C7 holds."" Both conjuncts are true, so C8 is true.

3. Consistency with context:
   - None of the conditions require event2 to actually occur; they are all satisfied given the tautological forms and the fact that event2 need not happen. The context does not contradict any of the Ci statements.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C8 is true or false given the context and the other conditions C1–C7.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P), so C1 is true at any time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds now (indeed always), it certainly holds at some time in the future as well — so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4 and C5: same form as C1, so each is true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true (and the implication structure would be true even if C4 were false).
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" Both disjuncts are true, so C7 is true.

Note on the context: the facts about event1 and event2 (initial event1, after event2 event1 must happen, after event1 no other events) do not invalidate any of the above because the implications are tautological or about other formulas holding; none require event2 actually occurs. Vacuous truth covers implications when the antecedent never happens.

Step 3 — combine for C8
- C8 = C2 and C7. We found C2 is true and C7 is true, so C8 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the context as a timeline:
   - At time 0, event2 occurs.
   - After that (time ≥1) no further events occur.
   - The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs under the given constraints.

2. Interpret the conditions in standard temporal terms:
   - ""always"" = globally (G), ""eventually"" = sometime in the future (F).
   - C1 = G(event2): event2 holds at every future time.
   - C2 = F(C1) = F(G(event2)).
   - C3 = F(C2) = F(F(G(event2))) which is equivalent to F(G(event2)).
   - C4 = G(C3).
   - C5 = G(C3) (same as C4).
   - C6 = C4 ∧ C5, so C6 ≡ G(C3).

3. Evaluate C1..C6 on the timeline:
   - C1 (G(event2)) is false: event2 occurs at time 0 but not at time 1 (no events there), so event2 does not hold at all times.
   - Therefore C2 = F(G(event2)) is false: there is no future time from which event2 holds at all subsequent times.
   - C3 is the same as C2 (F(F(..) simplifies to F), so C3 is false.
   - C4 and C5 (G(C3)) are false because C3 is false at the initial time.
   - Hence C6 (C4 ∧ C5) is false.

Conclusion: C6 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happens. So ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true at the initial state.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — true at the initial state because C1 is true.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). But after event2 no other events can happen, so in the next state event2 does not occur and there will be no future occurrence of event2. Thus at the next state C1 is false and event2 is false, so C2 is false there. Therefore C3 is false at the initial state.
- C4 is ""event1 happens or C3 holds"" — both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false at the initial state.
- C5 is again ""event2 eventually happens"" — true (same as C1).
- C6 = C4 or C5 is true (because C5 is true).
- C7 = C6 or event2 is true at the initial state (C6 true).
- C8 = ""C7 always holds"" (G C7) requires C7 to be true in every state. But in the next state C6 is false (C5 is false there) and event2 does not hold, so C7 is false in that next state. Hence C7 is not always true, so C8 is false.
- C9 = ""C8 always holds"" is therefore false as well (C8 is already false at the initial state).

So C9 is False.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Timeline given: at time 0 event2 occurs; at some later time t1 event1 must occur; after event1 no events occur (so for all times ≥ t1, neither event1 nor event2 hold).
- C1: ¬event2. This is false at time 0 (event2 happened) but true at every time > 0.
- C2 = F C1: ""eventually C1"" — true (e.g., at time 1 and thereafter C1 holds).
- C3 = G C2: ""always C2"" — true, because at every time point there is some future time where ¬event2 holds (indeed immediately after time 0).
- C4 = C3 ∨ event1: true (since C3 is true).
- C5 = ¬C4: false (never true).
- C6 = F C5: false (there is no time where C5 holds).
- C7 = G C6: false (C6 does not hold at any time).
- C8 = ¬C7: true (since C7 is false).
- C9 = G C8: true (C8 holds at every time).

Thus C9 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So whenever event2 happens, event1 happens (i.e. C1/C6-type statement is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen, so the two events alternate; in particular event1 does occur after the initial event2.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" True (follows from the context).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (because C1 does hold).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" False (event1 happens but C2 is false, so the conjunction is false).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False (C3 is false, so it cannot always hold).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" False (C4 is false).
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" True (same as C1).
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" True — the implication is vacuously true because C5 is false (and in any case C6 is actually true).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" True (C7 is true).
- C9: ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" C8 is true and event2 did happen initially, so C9 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context, ""After event2, event1 must happen"" gives C1 (If event2 happens, then event1 happens). So C1 is true.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" — that is false because C1 does hold.
- C3 is ""event1 happens and C2 holds"" — event1 does happen, but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") and C5 (""C4 always holds"") are therefore false.
- C6 repeats the same as C1, so C6 is true.
- C7 is ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" Since C5 is false, the implication C7 is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true), and additionally the consequent C6 is true anyway.
- C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true (C7 is true, so it holds).
- C9 is ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" C8 holds and event2 did happen initially, so C9 is true.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: event2 did happen initially, and the rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" mean the implication event2 -> event1 holds. So C1 (If event2 happens, then event1 happens) is true.

- C2 states ""C1 does not hold."" That contradicts C1, so C2 is false.

- C3 is ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false (the conjunction fails).

- C4 is ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

- C5 is ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

- C6 repeats C1 (If event2 happens, then event1 happens), so C6 is true.

- C7 is ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" Because C5 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C7 is true.

- C8 is ""C7 always holds."" C7 is true, so C8 is true.

- C9 is ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" C8 is true and event2 did happen initially, so C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: event1 happens initially and thereafter no events occur. So event2 never happens at any state.
- C1 and C2 (""Event2 always happens"") are false.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is false.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because C3 is false (and thus false in the next state as well).
- C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is a material implication with a false antecedent (C1 is false), so C5 is true (vacuously).
- C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true because C5 holds at every state.
- C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is false because C6 is true.
- C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is true because C7 is false.
- C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is true because C8 holds at every state (including the next state).

Therefore C9 is True.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What the context implies about events
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus event2 can never occur at any time (there is no time before the initial state, and no subsequent event can occur after event1).

2) Evaluate atomic claims about event2
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" — False (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" — False (same as C1).

3) Build up the remaining claims
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is false (and remains false), C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" C1 is false, so the implication is true (false → anything is true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is true now and stays true (because C1 and C4’s truth values do not change), so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is true, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" C7 is false, so C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" C8 is true (and remains true), so C9 is true in the next state.

Conclusion: C9 is True.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no further events can happen. So there is just the initial state (no next state), and event2 does not occur at any time.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (after event1 nothing happens), so a next-state claim is false. Thus C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" Implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" There is only the initial state and no successors, so C5 being true means C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" Again there is no next state, so this next-state claim is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Votes: {'True': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After any event1, event2 must occur later.
   - After any event2, event1 must occur later.
   Therefore event1 and event2 alternate indefinitely from the initial event2; in particular, event1 does eventually occur. (So C1 is true.)

2. Evaluate conditions at the initial state:
   - C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — True (by the alternation).
   - C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — True (C1 holds; also event2 held initially).
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — False.
   - C4: ""C3 always holds"" — False (since C3 is already false).
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — False.
   - C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds"" — At the initial state this is False (event1 does not hold yet and C5 is false).

3. Consider the first time t1 when event1 occurs (such a time exists):
   - At t1, event1 happens, so:
     - C1 still holds (event1 happens at or after t1).
     - C2 holds (because C1 holds).
     - C3 is false, C4 false, C5 false (as before).
     - C6: ""event1 happens or C5 holds"" — True (event1 happens at t1).
     - C7: ""C6 holds and event1 happens"" — True (both true at t1).
     - C8: ""C7 holds and event1 happens"" — True (C7 true and event1 is happening at t1).

4. Since C8 holds at time t1, ""C8 eventually holds"" (C9) is true.

Final answer:
True
---

---
Step 1 — system behavior
- Initially event2 happens.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next; after any event1, event2 must happen next.
=> The system alternates: event2 at time 0, event1 at time 1, event2 at time 2, event1 at time 3, … So event1 does occur (in fact infinitely often).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 occurs at time 1).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true already, C2 is true at every state.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False everywhere (because C2 always holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" This is true exactly at the states where event1 happens (because C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 holds and event1 happens."" True at each state where event1 happens.
- C8: ""C7 holds and event1 happens."" Equivalent to C7 at event1 states, so true at each event1 state.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" Since event1 happens at time 1 (and repeatedly), C8 holds at time 1, so C8 eventually holds.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context we have an alternating sequence of events starting at the initial state S0:
   - S0: event1 happens.
   - S1: after event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens.
   - S2: after event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens.
   - And so on (alternation event1, event2, event1, ...).

2. Evaluate the conditions in the next state S1 (because C8 asserts ""C7 holds in the next state""):
   - C1 (event1 eventually happens): True in S1, because event1 occurs at S2.
   - C2 is the same as C1, so True in S1.
   - C3 (C2 holds and event1 happens now): False in S1, because although C2 is true, event1 is not happening in S1 (S1 has event2).
   - C4 same as C3, so False in S1.
   - C5 (C4 does not hold): True in S1 (since C4 is false).
   - C6 (if C3 then C5): In S1 this implication is vacuously True because C3 is false.
   - C7 (if C1 then C6): In S1, C1 is true and C6 is true, so C7 is True in S1.

3. Therefore C7 holds in the next state S1, so C8 is True.
---

---
Step 1 — interpret the context as a timeline of states
- S0 (initial): event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → so S1 has event2.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → so S2 has event1, and so on.
Thus the sequence is event1 (S0), event2 (S1), event1 (S2), event2 (S3), ...

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci at the initial state S0
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 happens now and again later).
- C2: same as C1 → True.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" At S0, C2 is True and event1 happens at S0 → C3 True.
- C4: same as C3 → True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is True at S0, C5 is False at S0.
- C6: ""If C3 holds, then C5 holds."" At S0, C3 is True but C5 is False, so the implication is False at S0.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" At S0, C1 is True but C6 is False, so C7 is False at S0.

Step 3 — evaluate C7 in the next state S1 (this is C8’s claim)
We need C7 at S1. At S1:
- event1 does not happen at S1 (event2 happens at S1).
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is True at S1 because after S1 we have S2 with event1.
- C3 at S1 (""C2 holds and event1 happens""): C2 holds at S1 (event1 eventually happens), but event1 does not happen at S1, so C3 is False at S1.
- C5 at S1 (""C4 does not hold""): C4 = C3, so C4 is False at S1, hence C5 is True at S1.
- C6 at S1: ""If C3 holds then C5 holds."" With C3 False at S1, this implication is vacuously True at S1.
- Therefore, C7 at S1: ""If C1 holds then C6 holds."" At S1 both C1 and C6 are True, so C7 is True at S1.

Conclusion
C8 = ""C7 holds in the next state"" is True. Final answer: True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen → once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur thereafter.
- Therefore event1 does not happen (event1 is false).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition with event2 = True and event1 = False
- C1: Event1 does not happen → True.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens → True ∧ True = True.
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds → event2 is True and C2 is True, so C3 = True.
- C4: Event1 does not happen → True.
- C5: If C3 holds, then C4 holds → True → True = True.
- C6: Event1 happens and C5 holds → False ∧ True = False.
- C7: Event1 does not happen → True.
- C8: C6 holds and C7 holds → False ∧ True = False.
- C9: C8 does not hold → since C8 is False, C9 = True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — facts from the context:
- event2 happens (given).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event1 cannot happen after event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant if event1 never happens).

Step 2 — follow the hypothesis implications:
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Since event2 is true, C3 forces C2 to be true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" event2 is true, so C2 being true implies C1 is true.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" So event1 is false.
- C4 is the same as C1, so true.
- C3 is true (we already used it), so C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Antecedent true and C4 true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" But event1 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event1 does not happen."" True.
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" C6 is false, so C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Negation of false is true.

Conclusion: C9 is True.
---
We are asked whether C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true given the context.

From the context:
- Event2 happened initially, so event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so event1 cannot happen at any time. Therefore event1 is false.

Now evaluate the Ci's:

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" True and True → True.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" event2 is true and C2 is true → C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" True.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 True and C4 True → C5 is True.
- C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" Event1 happens is False, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""Event1 does not happen."" True.
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" C6 False and C7 True → C8 is False.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is False, C9 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true under the given scenario. Step‑by‑step:

1. Context (timeline): initially event2 at t=0, and the rules force alternation:
   - t=0: event2
   - t=1: event1
   - t=2: event2
   - t=3: event1
   - … so event1 holds at odd times only.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — false (there are states, e.g. t=0,2,... where event1 does not happen).
   - C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — false everywhere because C1 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false (C2 is false in every state).
   - C4: same as C3 — false.
   - C5: ""C3 and C4"" — false.
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — true (since C5 is false).
   - C7: ""C6 always holds"" — true, because C6 is true in every state.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- After event1, event2 must occur.
So the system alternates events: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, … (and this pattern repeats).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions state-by-state (the temporal operators are the usual “always” = in all (future) states):
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false: there are states (e.g. S0, S2, ...) where event2 happens, so event1 does not hold in every state.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false in every state, C2 is false in every state (even in states where event1 occurs, C1 still fails).
- C3 and C4: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is false in every state, C2 is also false in every next state; so C3 and C4 are false in every state.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is false in every state.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false everywhere, C6 is true in every state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is true in every state, C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
=> Events alternate forever: ..., event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" In the alternating sequence, event1 occurs only at every other state (not at every state). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This requires C1 to be true; since C1 is false, C2 is false at every state (even at states where event1 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false at every state, C3 is false at every state.
- C4: same as C3, so false at every state.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is false at every state.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false everywhere, C6 is true at every state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is true at every state, C7 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify what’s being asked:
- We must determine whether C7 (C3 ∨ C6) is true given the context and the listed Ci.

Use the context to evaluate the Ci:
- Context says: initially event1 happened. So event1 does occur (at least once).
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") says C1 is always true; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true because C2 is false.
- C4 is the same as C3, so C4 is also true.
- C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens""): since C4 is true and event1 does indeed happen (initially), the implication C5 is true.
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false because C5 does hold.

Now C7 = C3 ∨ C6. We have C3 = true and C6 = false, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — events from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the initial time.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, no later events can occur. Since event1 already happened initially, no event2 can ever occur after that.
- Therefore event1 does happen (at least initially).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false because event1 did happen initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (already at the initial time), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" Same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" C4 is true and event1 does happen, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is true, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" C3 is true, C6 is false, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context, event1 happened initially. Therefore the statement C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.

2. C2 states ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

3. C3 states ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, C3 is true.

4. C4 is the same as C3 (""C2 does not hold""), so C4 is also true.

5. C5 says ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" C4 holds (true), and event1 does happen (initially), so C5 is true.

6. C6 states ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.

7. C7 is ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" C3 is true (C6 is false), so the disjunction is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — model the situation
- The initial state already has event2.  
- “After event2, no other events can happen” makes that initial state terminal (no future states where events can occur).  
- Therefore event1 never happens in any future state.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (event1 eventually happens): false.
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state): false (no next state, so X(C1) is false).
- C3 (C2 does not hold): true.
- C4 = C1: false.
- C5 = C2: false.
- C6 = C4 and C5: false.
- C7 = next(C6): false.
- C8 = C3 or C7 = true or false = true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So no event1 can ever happen at or after the initial state.)
- The ""after event1, no other events can happen"" clause is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, event1 cannot happen → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" If C1 is false now, it remains false (no events can occur) → C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1 → false.
- C5: same as C2 → false.
- C6: C4 and C5 → false.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: C3 or C7 → true or false = true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2 (and also after event1) no other events can happen. So from the initial state no future events occur — in particular event1 will never occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — False (event1 cannot happen after the initial event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" — False (since C1 is false, and there are no further occurrences of event1).

- C4: same as C1 — False.
- C5: same as C2 — False.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C8 is true or false.

Step-by-step:
- C1 says ""event2 happens and event2 happens"", i.e. C1 ≡ event2 (it holds exactly when event2 holds).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is the implication event2 → event2, which is a tautology, so C2 holds in every state.
- C3 is identical to C2, so C3 also holds in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 holds in every state, C4 holds in every state (every next state also satisfies C3).
- C5 is ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Since both C2 and C4 hold everywhere, C5 holds in every state.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Because C5 already holds now (indeed everywhere), ""eventually C5"" is true, so C6 holds.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is false because C6 does hold.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.

Final answer: True
---
You ask whether C8 is true or false.

Step-by-step:

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (redundant conjunct).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is equivalent to event2, C2 is the implication event2 → event2, which is true in every state (a tautology).
- C3 is identical to C2, so C3 is also true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is true in every state, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 holds now, then certainly it holds eventually, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" That asserts ¬C6, but C6 is true, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" That asserts ¬C7; since C7 is false, ¬C7 is true. Therefore C8 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must determine the truth of C8 (""C7 does not hold"") given the listed conditions and the context.

Step 2 — simplify and evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to just ""Event2 happens"" (a duplicate conjunct).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is (event2 → event2), which is a tautology — always true.
- C3: same as C2, also a tautology — always true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is true in every state, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 is true now (hence holds), then ""eventually C5"" is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" C7 is false, so ""C7 does not hold"" is true.

Conclusion
- C8 is True."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C7 (""If C3 holds, then C6 holds"") is True or False given the context and the Ci definitions.

1) Simplify the Ci formulas
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to just: Event1 happens. (So C1 ↔ Event1.)
- C2: C1 does not hold → C2 = ¬C1.
- C3: C2 does not hold → C3 = ¬C2 = ¬(¬C1) = C1. (So C3 ↔ C1.)
- C4: C2 does not hold → C4 = ¬C2 = C1. (So C4 ↔ C1 as well.)
- C5: C4 eventually holds → C5 = F(C4) = eventually C1.
- C6: C5 holds in the next state → C6 = X(C5) = next(eventually C1).
- C7: If C3 holds, then C6 holds → C7 = C3 → C6. Since C3 ↔ C1, C7 is equivalent to (Event1) → X(eventually Event1).

2) Use the context to determine which events can occur
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore, once event2 has occurred (and it has initially), event1 cannot occur now or at any future state. So Event1 is false in all states.

3) Evaluate each Ci under that model
- C1 (Event1) is false.
- C2 = ¬C1 is true.
- C3 = C1 is false.
- C4 = C1 is false.
- C5 = eventually C1 is false (C1 never becomes true).
- C6 = next(eventually C1) is false.
- C7 = (C3 → C6). Since C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Conclusion: C7 is True. Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — translate the C-conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: not C1.
- C3: not C2 = C1.
- C4: not C2 = C1 (same as C3).
- C5: eventually C4 = eventually C1.
- C6: next(C5) = next(eventually C1).
- C7: C3 -> C6, i.e. C1 -> next(eventually C1).

Step 2 — use the context to evaluate which events occur:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so no event1 occurs at any time.
Therefore C1 is false (event1 never happens), so C2 is true, and C3 and C4 are false. Consequently C5 is false (C4 never becomes true), and C6 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C7:
- C7 is ""if C3 then C6"". C3 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C3 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1 = ""Event1 happens"" (the repetition is redundant).
- C2 = not C1.
- C3 = not C2 = not(not C1) = C1. (So C3 is equivalent to C1.)
- C4 = not C2 = C1.
- C5 = eventually C4 = eventually C1.
- C6 = next C5 = in the next state, eventually C1 must hold.
- C7 = (C3 → C6) = (C1 → next(eventually C1)).

Step 3 — use the context about events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Because event2 already happened initially, event1 can never occur in any run.
- Therefore C1 is false in all runs. Hence C3 (which is equivalent to C1) is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C3 is false, C3 → C6 is true.

Final answer:
True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus from the initial state (where event1 has happened) there are no further transitions — no events, in particular no event2, can occur after that.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (no events can happen after the initial event1, and event2 did not happen before).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True (event2 never happens at any time).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True (if C2 holds at all times, it holds at some future time as well).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state (no transitions after event1), and a ""next"" property is false when no next state exists.
- C5: ""C1 always holds."" True (same as C2).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" False (C4 is false).
- C7: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (same as C1).
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" False (because C6 is false).

Final answer: False
---
Brief reasoning (concise):

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 can never occur. So C1 (event2 does not happen) is true.
- If event2 never occurs, then ""C1 always holds"" (C2 and C5) is true, hence ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) and therefore ""C3 holds in the next state"" (C4) are true.
- Thus C6 (C4 and C5) is true, and C7 (event2 does not happen) is true.
- Therefore C8 (C6 and C7) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 can never occur thereafter.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs (given the previous point).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (event2 cannot occur because event1 already happened and no further events can occur).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True (if event2 never happens at any time, C1 holds in every state).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True (C2 already holds now, so it certainly holds eventually).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" True (since C2 is always true, C3 is true in every state, including the next).
- C5: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, True.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" True (both components true).
- C7: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, True.
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" True (both components true).

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- s0 is the initial state and event1 happens there.
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur at some later state.
- After event2 occurs, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So the only possible event sequence consistent with the context is: event1 at s0, then event2 at s1, and then no further events after s1.

Step 2 — interpret the Ci
- C1: ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e. at the next state, event2 happens).
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: C3 does not hold = ""in the next state, event2 does not happen"".
- C5: event1 happens and C4 holds.
- C6: event1 happens or C5 holds.
- C7: C2 holds or C6 holds.
- C8: C7 always holds (in every state).

Step 3 — evaluate on the actual trace (s0, s1, then no further events)
- At s0: event1 is true; event2 happens in the next state (s1), so C1 true at s1, so C2 and C3 are true at s0. Thus C7 is true at s0.
- At s1: event2 happens at s1, but no events occur after s1. So in the next state after s1, event2 does not happen. Therefore C2 and C3 are false at s1. Event1 is false at s1, so C5 and C6 are false at s1. Hence C7 is false at s1.

Because C7 is false at s1, C7 is not true in every state, so C8 (""C7 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context we get a single possible execution trace:
   - State 0 (initial): event1 happens.
   - State 1: because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 happens.
   - State 2 and onward: because ""after event2, no other events can happen"", no events happen from here on.

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1 ≡ event2.
   - C2 ≡ X C1 ≡ X event2.
   - C3 ≡ X event2 (same as C2).
   - C4 ≡ not (X event2).
   - C5 ≡ event1 and not (X event2).
   - C6 ≡ event1 or C5 ≡ event1.
   - C7 ≡ (X event2) or event1.
   - C8 ≡ Always(C7).

3. Evaluate C7 on the trace:
   - State 0: event1 is true ⇒ C7 is true.
   - State 1: event1 is false (only event2 happens here). X event2 at State 1 asks whether event2 holds at State 2; but after event2 no events happen, so event2 is false at State 2 ⇒ X event2 is false. Thus at State 1 both disjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

4. Since C7 is false at State 1, Always(C7) (C8) does not hold.

Therefore C8 is False.

Reasoning:

- From the context: initially (state S0) event2 happens. After event2, event1 must happen (so at S1 event1 happens). After event1, event2 must happen (so at S2 event2 happens), and this alternation continues indefinitely: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, ...

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True at S0 because after the initial event2, event1 occurs at S1.

- C2 and C3: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" At S0 event2 is true, so both C2 and C3 are true at S0.

- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is true at S0 and event2 is true at S0, so C4 is true at S0.

- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Both hold at S0, so C5 is true at S0.

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds at S0, C6 is true at S0.

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 holds at S0, C7 is true at S0.

- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" We need to check S1. At S1: event1 holds immediately, event2 does not hold at S1, but C1 (event1 eventually happens) holds at S1 (it holds now), so C2/C3 hold at S1. C4 requires event2 at that state, so C4 is false at S1, but C5 (""C2 and C4"") is false at S1. However, C5 will become true at S2 (when event2 occurs again), so C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true at S1. Therefore C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true at S1. Hence C7 does hold in the next state.

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- We are asked whether C7 (""C5 holds or C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Set up the timeline (index states 0,1,2,...)
- State 0 (initial): event2 happened.
- By ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → event1 occurs in state 1.
- By ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → no events occur in state 2 and beyond.

Evaluate each condition (at state 0, the natural reference point)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From state 0, event1 occurs in state 1 → C1 is true at state 0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether C1 is true at state 1. At state 1 C1 would require event1 at state 2, but no events occur after state1 → C1 is false at state 1, so C2 is false at state 0. In fact C2 is false in every state (there is no state whose next state is state 0, and C1 is only true at state 0).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is false everywhere.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 never holds, C4 is false everywhere.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true (everywhere).
- C6: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This is the same pattern as C3 and is false everywhere.

Combine for C7
- C7 = C5 or C6. C5 is true, C6 is false, so C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---

---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

Set up the timeline of states from the context:
- State S0 (initial): event2 happened.
- Because “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 happens in the next state S1.
- Because “after event1, no other events can happen,” all states S2, S3, ... are terminal with no events.

Now evaluate the Ci propositions at the initial state S0:

- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” At S0 the next state is S1, and event1 does happen there. So C1 is True.

- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” This asks whether C1 is true at S1. At S1 the next state is S2, and event1 does not happen in S2 (no further events). So C1 is False at S1, hence C2 is False at S0.

- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” This asks whether C2 is true at S1. We just saw C2 is False at S1, so C3 is False at S0.

- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” That would require some future state where C3 is true. C3 would be true only if event1 happens two steps after that state, but event1 occurs only once (at S1). There is no state in the future of S0 that makes C3 true, so C4 is False.

- C5: “C4 does not hold.” Since C4 is False, C5 is True.

- C6: “C2 holds in the next state.” This is the same form as C3 but evaluated at S0: it asks whether C2 is true at S1. As noted, C2 is False at S1, so C6 is False.

- C7: “C5 holds or C6 holds.” C5 is True and C6 is False, so the disjunction is True.

Therefore C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C8 says ""C7 always holds"" (globally). We must decide whether, given the context, C7 is true at every state along the execution starting from the initial condition.

Step 2 — restate the context as a timeline rule set
- Initially (time 0) event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must occur (so at time 1 event1 occurs).
- After event1, no further events can occur (so from time 2 onward no events happen).

So a (minimal) execution is:
- t0: event2
- t1: event1
- t2, t3, ...: no events

Step 3 — understand the C-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"" at the current state.
- C2: Next(C1) — C1 holds at the next state.
- C3: Next(C1) — same as C2.
- C4: (If C2 then C3) — i.e. Next(C1) -> Next(C1). This is a tautology (always true at any state).
- C5: Next(C4) — C4 holds in the next state.
- C6: same as C1, i.e. event2 at the current state.
- C7: C5 or C6.
- C8: always C7 (C7 holds at every state).

Step 4 — evaluate on the trace
- C4 is true at every state (it's an implication of the same formula).
- Therefore C4 holds at t0, t1, t2, ...
- C5 = Next(C4) is true at every state that has a successor (on our infinite extension with no events from t2 onward, every state has a next state and C4 holds there), so C5 is true at every state.
- C6 is true only at t0 (where event2 happens), false elsewhere.
- C7 = C5 or C6: since C5 is true at every state, C7 is true at every state.
- Hence C8 (""C7 always holds"") is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — model the timeline
- Let p mean ""event2 happens in the current state"", q mean ""event1 happens in the current state"".
- From the context: at state 0, p is true (event2). From ""after event2, event1 must happen"", at state 1 q is true. From ""after event1 no other events can happen"", from state 2 onward neither p nor q holds.

Step 2 — interpret the Ci
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" ≡ p.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ next(p) (i.e. p at the next state).
- C3: same as C2 ≡ next(p).
- C4: C2 -> C3 ≡ next(p) -> next(p), which is a tautology (always true) in every state because a formula implies itself.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" ≡ next(C4). Since C4 is true in every state, C5 is true in every state.
- C6: same as C1 ≡ p.
- C7: C5 ∨ C6. Since C5 is true everywhere, C7 is true everywhere.
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" ≡ globally C7. Because C7 is true in every state, C8 is true.

True

Step 1 — model the timeline
- Let s0 be the initial state: event2 happens there.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at the initial point (s0)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state s1 has event1, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3 (and C6): ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" At s0 event2 is true but C2 is false, so C3/C6 are false at s0. At s1 the antecedent (event2) is false, so C3/C6 are true at s1.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C1 is false at s0, C4 is vacuously true at s0.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" At s0 event2 happens, so C5 is true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is false at s0 but true at s1, so C6 holds eventually; hence C7 is true.
- C8: ""C5 holds and C7 holds."" Both are true, so C8 holds.

Final answer:

Step 1 — interpret the scenario
- State0 (initial): event2 happened.
- By the context, immediately after event2 (in State1) event1 happens.
- After event1 (State1), no further events occur (State2+ have no events).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition

C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- Next state after State0 is State1. In State1 event1 happens, not event2. So C1 is False.

C2: same as C1, so False.

C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""
- At State0 event2 does happen, but C2 is False, so the implication is False at State0. Thus C3 is False.

C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds.""
- C1 is False, so the implication is vacuously True. C4 is True.

C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens.""
- C4 is True (and event2 also happened initially), so C5 is True.

C6: same as C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds""), so False at State0.

C7: ""C6 eventually holds.""
- At State1 (after the initial event2), event2 does not happen, so the implication in C6 is true there (antecedent false). Therefore C6 holds at State1, so C6 holds at some future state — C7 is True.

C8: ""C5 holds and C7 holds.""
- C5 is True and C7 is True, so C8 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Goal: decide whether C8 (""C5 holds and C7 holds"") is true given the scenario.

Timeline from the context:
- At the initial state s0, event2 happened.
- After event2 (so at s1) event1 must happen.
- After event1 (from s1 onward) no other events can happen.

Evaluate the Ci at the initial state s0:

C1 / C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state s1 has event1 (not event2), so C1 and C2 are false at s0.

C3 / C6: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" At s0 event2 does happen, but C2 is false (event2 does not happen in s1), so C3 (and C6) are false at s0.

C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is false at s0, so C4 is vacuously true at s0.

C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" At s0 C4 holds, so C5 is true at s0.

C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" We check future states: at s1 (the next state) event1 happens and event2 does not, so the antecedent of C6 (""if event2 happens..."") is false there and C6 is true at s1 (vacuously). Thus C6 holds at s1, so C6 does eventually hold. Therefore C7 is true at s0.

Since both C5 and C7 are true at the initial state, C8 (""C5 holds and C7 holds"") is true.

The hypothesis asks whether C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context: event2 happens initially, then event1 must happen, and after event1 nothing else can happen. So event1 does happen (and it is terminal).
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — true (redundant, but true because event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — true, since C1 holds at the time event1 occurs.
- C3: same as C1 — true.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" — true (both antecedent and consequent are true).
- C5: same as C1 — true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — true (C6 is a global truth about the run; nothing later can falsify it).
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" — true.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — this negates a true statement, so C9 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen → in every state after the initial one, no events occur (so event1 is false in all subsequent states).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (no events after the initial state).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false at the initial state (since event1 happened), true at every subsequent state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — from the initial state this is true (C1 holds at the next state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — false (we just saw C2 is true).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" — at the next state C2 is still true (C1 already holds there), so C3 is false in the next state; hence C4 is false.
- C5: same as C4, therefore false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" — false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C6 is the disjunction ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" We must determine whether that disjunction is true given the context and the prior conditions.

Step 2 — consequences of the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state, event1 is true).
- “After event1, no other events can happen” implies that in every subsequent state no events occur (in particular event1 does not occur again).
- The rule “After event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” At the initial state C1 is false (event1 did happen), but at the next and later states C1 is true (no events, so event1 does not happen there).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” True — at the next state C1 holds.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” False, because C2 is true.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” False, since C3 is false (so it does not hold next).
- C5: same as C4, also false.
- C6: C4 or C5 — false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Summary of what’s being asked
- C6 is the disjunction “C4 holds or C5 holds.”
- C4 and C5 are both “C3 holds in the next state.” So C6 is true iff C3 holds in the next state.

Interpretation of the context (natural, standard reading)
- “Initially, event1 happened.” So at the initial state event1 is true.
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” Once event1 has happened, no further events occur in any later state.
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” This is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1 (no events can happen after event1), and event2 cannot have occurred before the initial event1 because the initial state already has event1.

Evaluate the conditions step by step
1. C1: “Event1 does not happen.” — false in the initial state (event1 did happen initially).
2. C2: “C1 eventually holds.” That asks whether there is some later state where event1 does not happen. Under the standard reading, event1 was an initial instantaneous event and no other events occur afterwards, so in the next states event1 is not happening. Therefore C1 does hold at some future state, so C2 is true.
3. C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
4. C4 and C5: “C3 holds in the next state.” Because C3 is false (and remains false), C3 does not hold in the next state. So C4 and C5 are both false.
5. C6: “C4 holds or C5 holds.” Both are false, so the disjunction is false.

Reasoning:

- From the context: event1 has happened initially, and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 will eventually happen. Hence C1 is true.

- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since after event1 event2 must happen, in the immediate successor state event2 will still eventually happen, so C2 is true.

- C3 is ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is true, so C3 is true. C4 is the same, so C4 is true.

- C5 is the same as C1, so C5 is true.

- C6 is ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

- C7 is ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" C3 and C6 are true, so the implication C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide the truth of C7: (If C3 holds, then C6 holds) given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus any run consistent with the context is: event1 has occurred, then at some point event2 occurs, then nothing else.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition (at the initial state)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (the context requires event2 after event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" True — from the next state (whether it is right before event2 or the state where event2 has already happened) event2 still eventually happens (either immediately or already did), so C1 is true in the next state.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" True — event1 already happened (and C2 is also true), so the disjunction is true.
- C4: same as C3, so True.
- C5: same as C1, so True.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Since C4 is True and C5 is True, the implication is True.
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" C3 is True and C6 is True, so the implication is True.

You ask whether C8 is true or false. Step-by-step:

1. Let E1 mean ""Event1 happens"". From the Hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" → C1 = E1.
   - C2: same → C2 = E1.

2. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" → C3 = not C2 = not E1.

3. C4: ""C3 does not hold"" → C4 = not C3 = not(not E1) = E1.

4. C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" → C5 = (C1 → C4). Since C1 = E1 and C4 = E1, C5 = (E1 → E1) which is true. So C5 = True.

5. C6: ""C2 does not hold"" → C6 = not C2 = not E1 (same as C3).

6. C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds"" → C7 = True and not E1 = not E1.

7. C8: ""C7 does not hold"" → C8 = not C7 = not(not E1) = E1.

From the Context we are told ""Initially, event1 happened"", so E1 is true. Therefore C8 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So the statement ""Event1 happens"" is true.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"", so C1 is True.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is False, C4 is True.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" — C1 is True and C4 is True, so the implication C5 is True.
- C6: ""C2 does not hold"" — C2 is True, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds"" — C5 is True but C6 is False, so C7 is False.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — since C7 is False, C8 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine the truth value of C8 given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happens, so ""event1 happens"" is true.
- The rules about after event1/event2 force alternation but that doesn't negate the fact that event1 does happen (it actually guarantees event2 will also occur later).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ⇒ equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" ⇒ True.
- C2: same as C1 ⇒ True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ⇒ not C2 ⇒ False (since C2 is True).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ⇒ not C3 ⇒ True.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" ⇒ C1 → C4. C1 is True and C4 is True, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""C2 does not hold"" ⇒ same as C3 ⇒ False.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds"" ⇒ True ∧ False ⇒ False.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" ⇒ not C7 ⇒ True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C6 = (C4) or (C5). Both C4 and C5 are ""C1 and C3"" (they are identical), so C6 is true exactly when C1 and C3 are both true.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal). After event1 no other events can happen as well (event1 would also be terminal).
- C1 (and C2): ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — this asserts that in the immediate successor state an event2 occurs.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. at all (future) states C2 is true (so every state’s next-step has event2).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C3
- Since event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, there is no successor state in which an event2 occurs. Thus C1 (and C2) is false.
- Because C2 is false at the current point, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is also false.

Step 4 — conclude about C6
- C1 is false and C3 is false, so C1 and C3 is false. Therefore C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Context: initially event2 has already happened. Also, ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means once event2 has occurred the system reaches a state with no further events (no successor state where an event occurs).
2. C1/C2 (""Event2 happens in the next state""): there is no next event state after the initial event2, so event2 does not ""happen in the next state."" Thus C1 and C2 are false.
3. C3 (""C2 always holds""): since C2 is false now, it cannot always hold. So C3 is false.
4. C4 and C5 are conjunctions of C1 and C3, both of which are false, so C4 and C5 are false.
5. C6 is C4 or C5; with both false, C6 is false.

Therefore C6 is False.
---
C6 is False.

Reasoning step‑by‑step:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen — so once event2 has occurred there is no subsequent state in which any event (including event2) can occur.
- C1 and C2 both assert: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Given that after event2 there is no next state (no further events), the “next” occurrence of event2 does not exist; so C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 says “C2 always holds.” Since C2 is false at the initial point (no next state with event2), C3 is false.
- C4 and C5 are conjunctions involving C1 and C3; because C1 and C3 are false, C4 and C5 are false.
- C6 is C4 or C5; with both disjuncts false, C6 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C6 is False."

The hypothesis asks whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1, C2, C5 are of the form ""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (p -> p), which are logical tautologies, so C1, C2 and C5 hold.
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 both hold, C3 is true.
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is true, C4 holds.
- C6 is ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" Although C5 holds, event1 does not happen (the context says event2 happened initially and no other events can occur afterward), so C6 is false.
- C7 is ""C4 holds or C6 holds."" Since C4 holds, C7 is true.
- C8 is ""C7 always holds."" Because C7 is true, C8 holds.
- C9 is ""C8 eventually holds."" If C8 always holds then it certainly holds at some (indeed every) future point, so C9 is true.

Final answer:

We are asked whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context facts:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen. (So no event1 can occur after the initial state.)
   - After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant because event1 does not occur.)

2. Evaluate conditions:
   - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This implication is true (and in fact event2 does happen initially).
   - C2: same as C1, so true.
   - C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" C1 and C2 both hold, so C3 is true.
   - C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is a static true statement here, so C4 holds.
   - C5: same as C1, so true.
   - C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" Event1 does not happen (because event2 occurred and stops further events), so C6 is false.
   - C7: ""C4 holds or C6 holds."" C4 holds, so C7 is true.
   - C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is true now and remains true, so C8 holds.
   - C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" Since C8 already holds (and always), it certainly holds at some time (now), so C9 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" — False (no events occur after the initial state).

3. C2 and C3 are the same as C1 — both False.

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — True (since C3 is False).

5. C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" — False (C2 is False, so the conjunction is False).

6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" — False (C5 is already False now and nothing in later states can make C2 true, so C5 is False in the next state as well).

7. C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" — True, because the antecedent C6 is False, so the implication is vacuously true.

8. C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" — True, since C7 already holds now.

9. C9: ""C1 holds or C8 holds."" — True, because C8 is True.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 has already happened, and after event2 no further events can occur. So in the next state no events (including event2) can occur. Therefore C1/C2/C3 (""event2 happens in the next state"") are false.

- C4 says C3 does not hold. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

- C5 is ""C2 holds and C4 holds"". But C2 is false while C4 is true, so C5 is false (and indeed impossible, since C2 and C3 are the same statement and C4 asserts C3 false).

- C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state"". Because C5 is false now (and cannot become true), C6 is false.

- C7 is the implication ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens"". An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C7 is true (vacously).

- C8 says C7 eventually holds. Since C7 already holds, C8 is true.

- C9 is ""C1 holds or C8 holds"". C1 is false but C8 is true, so the disjunction C9 is true.

Thus C9 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened, and the context says: after event2 no other events can happen. So from the initial state onward, no events (including event2) occur in any future state.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state
- C1 (event2 happens in the next state): False (no events can occur after the initial event2).
- C2 (same as C1): False.
- C3 (same as C1): False.
- C4 (C3 does not hold): True (because C3 is false).
- C5 (C2 holds and C4 holds): False (C2 is false, so the conjunction is false).
- C6 (C5 holds in the next state): False — in the next state C5 still fails because event2 does not occur there, so C2 (relative to that state) is false, making C5 false.
- C7 (If C6 holds, then event2 happens): True — a material implication with a false antecedent (C6 is false) is true.
- C8 (C7 eventually holds): True — C7 already holds in the initial state, so it “eventually” holds.
- C9 (C1 holds or C8 holds): C1 is false but C8 is true, so C9 is True.

Reasoning, step by step:

1. From the context:
   - Initially, event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   Therefore once event1 has happened (as it did initially) there are no further events; in particular event2 never happens.

2. Evaluate conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" — False (event2 never happens).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds."" — False (C1 is false).
   - C3: same as C2 — False.
   - C4: ""C3 always holds."" — False.
   - C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" — True (implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true).
   - C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" — False (C2 false, C5 true → conjunction false).
   - C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" — False (C6 is false, and there are no further states after the initial one).
   - C8: ""Event1 happens or C7 holds."" — True, because event1 did happen initially.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
We are asked whether C8 (""Event1 happens or C7 holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
From ""after event1 no other events can happen"" and the fact event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) ever occur.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False (C1 is false).
- C3: same as C2, False.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" True (antecedent C4 is false, so implication is vacuously true).
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" False (C2 false, C5 true → conjunction false).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" False (C6 is false; also there is effectively no next state after the initial event).
- C8: ""Event1 happens or C7 holds."" True, because event1 did happen initially.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore, once the initial event1 has happened, there are no further events (so event2 does not occur at any time after the initial state).
- (The other sentence “After event2, no other events can happen” is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” False — event2 does not happen (event1 happened and no further events can occur).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” False, because C1 is false.
- C3: “C1 always holds.” (same as C2) False.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” False.
- C5: “If C4 holds, then event2 happens.” True — antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
- C6: “C2 holds and C5 holds.” False, because C2 is false (even though C5 is true).
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” False — there is no next state after event1 (or C6 does not hold there), so C7 does not hold.
- C8: “Event1 happens or C7 holds.” True — event1 does happen (initially), so the disjunction is true regardless of C7.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Because event1 happens initially and nothing can happen after event1, event2 can never occur (there is no time after the initial event for event2 to happen).

Step 2 — examine C8 and C9
- C8: ""If event2 happens, then C7 holds."" Since event2 never happens in any model consistent with the context, the antecedent of C8 is always false, so C8 is vacuously true in every model of the context.
- C9: ""If C2 holds, then C8 holds."" Because C8 is already true in every model of the context, the implication in C9 is true regardless of whether C2 holds or not.

Conclusion
C9 is True.

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Evaluate the claims step by step:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since event2 has already happened and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot happen now or later. So C1 is false.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Because C1 is false, C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true now and nothing can change it (no events occur after event2), so C3 remains true in all states; C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens."" C4 is true but event1 does not happen, so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false now and cannot become true later, so C6 is false.

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is false and will remain false, so C7 is false.

- C8: ""If event2 happens, then C7 holds."" Event2 did happen, so the antecedent is true; since C7 is false, the implication is false. Therefore C8 does not hold.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
The hypothesis asks whether ""C8 does not hold"" (C9) is true.

Step-by-step evaluation given the context (event2 occurred initially; after event2 no events can occur; after event1 event2 must occur):

- C1 (event1 eventually happens): False — event1 cannot happen after event2, and event2 already happened.
- C2 (C1 does not hold): True.
- C3 (C2 eventually holds): True — C2 holds already, so it eventually holds.
- C4 (C3 always holds): True — C3 holds now and at all future states (nothing changes).
- C5 (C4 holds and event1 happens): False — event1 never happens.
- C6 (C5 holds in the next state): False.
- C7 (C6 eventually holds): False.
- C8 (if event2 happens, then C7 holds): False — event2 did happen but C7 is false, so the implication fails.
- C9 (C8 does not hold): True.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 will never occur in any future state.

2. Evaluate the Ci one by one:
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens""): false, because event1 cannot occur.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold""): true (negation of C1).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): true, since C2 already holds now (so it certainly holds at some future point).
- C4 (""C3 always holds""): true, because C3 holds now and at every future state (the situation is stable).
- C5 (""C4 holds and event1 happens""): false, because event1 does not happen.
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state""): false.
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds""): false, since C6 never holds.
- C8 (""If event2 happens, then C7 holds""): false, because event2 does happen (initially) but C7 is false, so the implication fails.

3. C9 is ""C8 does not hold"". Since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Thus C9 is True."

Step 1 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen; since event1 happens initially, no events (including event2) can ever happen.
- Therefore event2 never happens.

Step 2 — evaluate relevant Ci's
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is true.
- C8 (""event2 does not happen"") is the same as C1, so C8 is true.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true because C1 is true and event1 happened initially.
- C3 (""if event1 happens then C2 holds"") is true: event1 does happen and C2 holds, so the implication is true.
- C4 (""if C3 holds then event1 happens"") is true because C3 holds and event1 does happen.
- Consequently C5 (""C4 eventually holds""), C6, and C7 (which are temporalized statements about C4/C5) are also satisfied (at worst trivially true because the underlying facts already hold now).

Step 3 — C9
- C9 is ""C7 holds or C8 holds"". We already established C8 is true, so C9 is true.

Final answer:
True

True

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context: event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never happens. So C1 and C8 (""Event2 does not happen"") are true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state s0: event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from s0 there is no next state with any event.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in that situation
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False (there is no next state after s0).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" False (C1 is false, so the conjunction is false).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" True (material implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C4: same as C1, so False.
- C5: same form as C3, so True.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" False or True → True.

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" C3 is True and C6 is True, so the implication is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred (as it has initially), no further events (including event2) can occur.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Impossible given the context, so C1 = False.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is False, so C2 = False.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C3 = True.
- C4: same as C1, so C4 = False.
- C5: same form as C3, so C5 = True (vacuously).
- C6: ""C4 or C5"" = False or True = True.
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" C3 is True and C6 is True, so the implication is True.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so there is no next-state event after the initial state (in particular, event2 cannot happen later).
- (Also after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 never occurs here.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False (no next event after event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" False (C1 is false).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" True (implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C4: same as C1, so False.
- C5: same form as C3, so True.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" False or True = True.
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" C3 is true and C6 is true, so the implication is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- Let s0 be the initial state. Event2 happened in s0. Because “after event2, no other events can happen,” there are no event occurrences in any future state (s1, s2, ...).

Evaluate conditions at s0 (and where needed at s1):

- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” At s1 no events happen, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2: “Event2 happens or C1 holds.” Event2 happened in s0, so C2 is true at s0.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true at s0.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” At s1, event2 does not happen and C1 (relative to s1) is false, so C3 is false at s1. Thus C4 is false at s0.
- C5: “If C4 holds, then event2 happens.” Since C4 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C5 is true at s0.
- C6: “C2 holds or C5 holds.” Both are true, so C6 is true at s0.
- C7: “C6 holds and event2 happens.” C6 is true and event2 happened in s0, so C7 is true at s0.
- C8: “C7 always holds.” For this to be true, C7 must hold at all future states. At s1, event2 does not happen, so C7 is false at s1 (because the conjunct “event2 happens” fails). Therefore C8 is false.

Final answer:
False
---

---
Answer: False

Reasoning step‑by‑step

1. Setup/assumptions
- Let s0 be the initial state. At s0, event2 happened.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means in every later state (s1, s2, ...) neither event1 nor event2 occurs.

2. Evaluate conditions at states
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” At s0 the next state s1 has no events, so C1 is false at s0. In general C1 is false in every state (no future state has event2).
- C2 (and C3): “Event2 happens or C1 holds.” At s0 event2 happens now, so C2 is true at s0. In s1 and later, event2 does not happen and C1 is false, so C2 is false there.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” Since C3 is false in all later states, C4 is false everywhere.
- C5: “If C4 holds, then event2 happens.” This implication has a false antecedent everywhere (C4 false), so C5 is true vacuously in every state.
- C6: “C2 holds or C5 holds.” Since C5 is true everywhere, C6 is true in every state.
- C7: “C6 holds and event2 happens.” C6 is true everywhere, but event2 only holds at s0, so C7 is true at s0 and false at s1 and later.
- C8: “C7 always holds.” That requires C7 to hold in every state; but C7 fails at s1 (and later), so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The question asks whether C9 (""If C3 holds, then C8 holds"") is true given the context.

2. C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" C1 and C2 are identical (""Event2 always happens""), so C3 is of the form A -> A, which is a tautology. Therefore C3 is true.

3. Evaluate C8: ""If event2 happens, then C7 holds."" The context tells us that event2 happened initially and that after event2 no other events can happen. That means event2 does not occur at every later time — so the claim ""Event2 always happens"" is false. Thus C6 (""Event2 always happens"") is false. C4 is the same claim, so C4 is false; C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is also false (it will never become true). Hence C7 = (C5 or C6) is false.

4. Since event2 does happen (initially) but C7 is false, the implication in C8 (""If event2 happens, then C7 holds"") is false.

5. We have C3 true and C8 false, so the implication C9 (""If C3 holds, then C8 holds"") is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — From the context:
- Event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Therefore event2 does happen.

Step 2 — Evaluate the Ci:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" False (contradicts Step 1).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event1 did happen but C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: Same as C2, so false.
- C4: C2 and C3 hold. False (both conjuncts false).
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" C4 is false, so this implication is vacuously true.
- C6: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, false.
- C7: C5 and C6 hold. False (true and false => false).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — from the context:
- event1 happened (True).
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ event2 happens (True).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is consistent with the above and doesn't prevent event2.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition given event1 = True and event2 = True:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" → False.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Antecedent True, consequent False ⇒ C2 is False.
- C3: same as C2 ⇒ False.
- C4: C2 and C3 ⇒ False and False ⇒ False.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C4 is False, this implication is vacuously True ⇒ C5 is True.
- C6: ""Event2 does not happen."" ⇒ False (same as C1).
- C7: C5 and C6 ⇒ True and False ⇒ False.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" C7 is False, so C8 is True.

Final answer: True

You ask whether C8 is true or false.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 does happen (event2 is true).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false (because event2 does happen).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1"" — false (event1 is true while C1 is false, so the implication is false).
- C3: same as C2 — false.
- C4: C2 and C3 — false.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"" — true (C4 is false, so the implication is vacuously true).
- C6: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false (same as C1).
- C7: C5 and C6 — false (true and false = false).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — true (since C7 is false).

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So there is no successor state and event1 will never occur.
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens""): False.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold""): True (since C1 is false).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") and C4 (""C2 eventually holds""): Both True (C2 already holds now).
- C5 (""if C3 then C4""): True (true implies true).
- C6 (""C5 holds or event1 happens""): True (C5 holds).
- C7 (""C6 holds in the next state""): False — there is no next state after the initial state (no further events after event2), so ""in the next state"" is not satisfied.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. (Also after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 did not happen initially.)

Step 2 — evaluate the claims one by one
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the run starts with event2 and no further events can occur, event1 cannot happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Both antecedent and consequent are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" C5 is true, so C6 is true (regardless of event1).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state: after event2 no other events (hence no transition to a next state) can occur. Since there is no successor state, the ""next"" condition is not satisfied, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event2 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (we start in that state), no further events/transitions occur — there is no next state.

2. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" From the initial state (after event2) no further events can happen, so event1 will never occur. Therefore C1 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

4. C3 and C4: both assert ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds in the initial state, so ""eventually C2"" is true for both C3 and C4.

5. C5: ""If C3 holds then C4 holds."" Since C3 and C4 are true, this implication is true.

6. C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" C5 is true, so C6 is true in the current state.

7. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no further events/transitions after event2), so the ""next"" condition cannot be satisfied. Therefore C7 is false.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So a valid trace is: initial state has event2, the next state has event1, and then nothing else happens.

2. Evaluate the conditions on that trace:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From the initial state the next state has event1 (not event2), so C1 is false.
   - C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does happen (right after the initial event2), but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 is false (at the state where event1 happens).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false at least at the state where event1 happens, C3 is false.
   - C4: same as C3, so C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" C4 is false but event1 does happen, so C5 is true.
   - C6: ""C5 holds or event2 happens."" C5 is true, so C6 is true.
   - C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" C3 is false but C6 is true, so C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step-by-step:

- From the context, initially event2 happened, so ""event2"" is true in the current (initial) state.
- C6 is ""C5 holds or event2 happens"". Since event2 is true right now, C6 is true in the current state.
- C7 is ""C3 holds or C6 holds"". Even if C3 is false, C6 is true, so C7 is true in the current state.

Therefore:

True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context:
  - State S0 (initial): event2 happened.
  - State S1 (next): because after event2 event1 must happen, event1 happens in S1.
  - After S1 no other events can happen (S1 is terminal).

- Evaluate the conditions at the initial state S0 (where we decide truth of the hypothesis):
  - C1 (event2 happens in the next state): false at S0, because the next state S1 has event1, not event2.
  - C2 (if event1 happens, then C1 holds): at S0 event1 does not happen, so C2 is vacuously true at S0.
  - C3 (C2 always holds): false, because at S1 event1 does happen, and then C1 is false (there is no event2 after event1), so C2 fails at S1.
  - C4 is the same as C3, hence false at S0 (and overall).
  - C5 (C4 holds or event1 happens): at S0 this is false (C4 false and event1 does not happen at S0); at S1 it is true.
  - C6 (C5 holds or event2 happens): at S0 this is true because event2 happens at S0 (so C6 is true at S0). (It is also true at S1 because C5 is true there.)
  - C7 (C3 holds or C6 holds): at S0 C3 is false but C6 is true, so C7 is true at the initial state.

Therefore C7 is True."

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens, so at the initial state event2 is true (and event1 is false).

- C9 is ""C1 or C8"". Since C1 is true, C9 is true regardless of the truth of C8.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event2 happened, so C1 (""event1 or event2"") is True. Hence C2 (same as C1) is True.
2. C3 = (event1 and C2). Since event1 did not happen initially, C3 is False.
3. C4 (""C3 always holds"") is False because C3 is not true now (so it cannot hold always).
4. C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is False (C4 is already false, so it does not hold next).
5. C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is therefore True.
6. C7 (""if event1 happens then C6 holds"") is True: the implication is vacuously true now because event1 does not happen in the initial state.
7. C8 (""if C7 holds then event2 happens"") is True: C7 holds and event2 did happen initially, so the implication is satisfied.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context: event1 happened initially. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never happens at any time, and ""event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
2. C2 = C1 or event2. With both disjuncts false, C2 is false.
3. C3 = event2 or C2. Both false, so C3 is false.
4. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"". Since C3 is false and no events change thereafter, C4 is false.
5. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"". C4 never becomes true, so C5 is false.
6. C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"". C5 is false, so C6 is false.
7. C7 = C1 or event2. As in step 2, C7 is false.
8. C8 states: if C6 holds, then C7 holds. Since C6 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context gives that event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 never happens.
- C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false (it did happen initially).
- C2 = C1 ∨ event2 is false ∨ false = false.
- C3 = event2 ∨ C2 is false ∨ false = false.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false.
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C7 = C1 ∨ event2 is the same as C2, so false.
- C8 is the implication (C6 → C7). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C8 is true.
---
Step 1 — use the context
- Initially, event1 happens. So the proposition ""event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur at any later time (and cannot occur initially either, since event1 did).

Step 2 — evaluate the Cs using that
- C1 is false.
- C2 = (C1 or event2) = false or false = false.
- C3 = (event2 or C2) = false or false = false.
- C4 = “C3 holds in the next state” — since C3 is false and nothing changes, C4 is false.
- C5 = “C4 eventually holds” — C4 never becomes true, so C5 is false.
- C6 = “C5 holds in the next state” = false.
- C7 = (C1 or event2) — same as C2, false.

Step 3 — evaluate C8
- C8 is the implication “If C6 holds, then C7 holds.” The antecedent C6 is false in all states consistent with the context, so the implication is vacuously true.

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is P → P, a tautology, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 does happen, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 hold, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Same as C2, and since C1 is true, C7 is true.

Step 3 — Evaluate C8
- C8: ""If C6 holds, then C7 holds."" C6 is true and C7 is true, so the implication C8 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C8 (""If C6 holds, then C7 holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Context summary:
- event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant for these conditions beyond ensuring event2 does happen).

Evaluate the conditions step by step:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is true, and event2 does happen, so the implication is true. Thus C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Both are true (C2 true, event1 happened), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" event2 does happen and C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: same form as C1, also true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Same as C2; true.
- C8: ""If C6 holds, then C7 holds."" C6 is true and C7 is true, so the implication is true.

Conclusion: C8 is True.
---
We are asked whether C8 (""If C6 holds, then C7 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

1) From the context: event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 happens. (Also, after event2 no other events can happen.)

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: (event2 → event2). This is a tautological implication, so C1 holds.
- C2: (event2 → C1). Since event2 does happen and C1 holds, C2 holds.
- C3: (C2 ∧ event1). Both C2 and event1 hold, so C3 holds.
- C4: (event2 → C3). event2 holds and C3 holds, so C4 holds.
- C5: (event2 → event2). Same as C1, so C5 holds.
- C6: (C4 ∨ C5). Both C4 and C5 hold, thus C6 holds.
- C7: (event2 → C1). Same form as C2, so C7 holds.

3) C8 is (C6 → C7). Since C6 holds and C7 holds, the implication is true.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C6 is true or false.

Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C6 asserts (C4 holds) AND (C5 holds). We must determine whether that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. (Also: after event2 no other events can happen.)
- From ""Initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot occur at any time.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event2 never happens (now or later), C1 holds at all times — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" With both C2 and C3 true, C4 is true.
- C5: same as C4, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
What the hypothesis asks
- We must evaluate whether C6 (C4 holds and C5 holds) is true given the context.

Examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterward.
- Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur (see below).

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened initially and that prevents any further events, event2 indeed does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event2 never happens in the timeline (because event1 has already occurred and blocks further events), C1 holds at all times — so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C4, so true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer
True

Goal: determine truth of C6.

1) From context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is True.

2) C2 says ""C1 always holds."" Since event2 never happens at any time, C1 is always true, so C2 is True.

3) C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is True.

4) C4 = (C2 or C3). With C2 True (and C3 True), C4 is True.

5) C5 is the same as C4, so C5 is True.

Reasoning (concise):
- The context states event2 happened (initially).
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — since event2 happened, C1 is true.
- C9 is ""C1 holds or C8 holds."" With C1 true, C9 is true regardless of C8.
---
Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen. So event2 is true; event1 did not happen (it cannot happen after event2 and there is no indication it happened before).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 = (event1 or event2) → true (event2 true).
- C2 = (event1 or event2) → true.
- C3 = (event1 or event2) → true.
- C4 = (event1 and C3) → false (event1 is false).
- C5 = (event2 and C4) → false (C4 is false).
- C6 = (C2 and C5) → false (C5 is false).
- C7 = ""C6 always holds"" → false (C6 does not hold).
- C8 = (if event1 then C7) → true (implication with false antecedent is true).
- C9 = (C1 or C8) → true (C1 is true, C8 is also true).

Final answer: True
---
You are asked whether C9 (“C1 holds or C8 holds”) is true given the initial facts and the chain of conditions.

Facts from context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So event1 does not occur.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant because event1 does not occur.)

Evaluate conditions step by step:
- C1: event1 or event2. True (event2 happened).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: same as C1. True.
- C4: event1 and C3. False (event1 did not happen, even though C3 is true).
- C5: event2 and C4. False (C4 is false).
- C6: C2 and C5. False (C5 is false).
- C7: “C6 always holds.” False, because C6 is false now.
- C8: if event1 then C7. True (the implication holds vacuously because event1 is false).
- C9: C1 or C8. True (C1 is true, and C8 is also true).

Therefore C9 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Goal: determine truth of C7 given the context.

Interpretation / assumptions:
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" means at time 0 event2 holds.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" means there is no successor state after time 0 (so any ""next"" formula at time 0 is false).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" is unused here because event1 never occurs in this trace.
- Use standard ""next"" semantics: X φ is false at a last state with no successor.

Evaluate the conditions at time 0:

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false: at time 0 event2 holds and no other events occur later, so event1 does not hold always.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" Same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 and C4 are both true, so the implication C5 is true at time 0.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" Event1 does not happen, and C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 (Event1 happens OR C6 holds) is True or False in the given setting.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (so at time 0, event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Because event2 occurs initially, no event (neither event1 nor event2) can occur at any later time.
- (The clause “after event1, event2 must happen” only matters if event1 occurs; but since event1 cannot occur after the initial event2, it never becomes relevant.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Given the context, event1 never occurs (because event2 already happened and prevents any further events), so C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Since C1 is false now and no events will occur later, C1 is also false in the next state, so C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” This is true (because C2 is false).
- C4: “C2 does not hold.” Same as C3, so true.
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” This is the implication p → p; since C3 and C4 are the same statement, C5 is true (both antecedent and consequent are true, and more generally p→p is always true).
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state.” At the next state C3 and C4 are still true (C2 is false there as well), so C5 is true in the next state. Therefore C6 is true.
- C7: “Event1 happens OR C6 holds.” Event1 does not happen, but C6 holds, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer
True
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: initially event2 happened; and after event2 no other events can happen. So the initial state has event2 and has no successor (no next state).
- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): false (event1 does not happen in the initial state).
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): false because there is no next state.
- C3 and C4 (""C2 does not hold""): both true (C2 is false).
- C5 (""If C3 then C4""): true (C3 and C4 are both true, and the implication is trivially satisfied).
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state""): false because there is no next state in which to evaluate C5.
- C7 (""Event1 happens or C6 holds""): both disjuncts are false (event1 does not happen now, C6 is false), so C7 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" => once event1 has happened (which is already true initially), event2 can never occur at any later time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never happens; it only would constrain behavior if event2 occurred.

Step 2 — interpret the Ci formulas
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (since it's event2 ∧ event2).
- C2 and C3: ""Eventually C1"" = ""Eventually event2"".
- C4: ""If C2 then C3"" = ""If eventually event2 then eventually event2"" — an implication from a formula to itself (tautologically true whenever C2 and C3 have the same truth value).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — C4 must be true at every time.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"".
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"".
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds"".

Step 3 — evaluate truth values given the context
- Event2 never happens (because event1 already happened and blocks any further events). So C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 and C3 (""eventually event2"") are false.
- C4 is the implication false → false, which is true (vacuous truth). So C4 holds.
- C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true because C4 is true at every time.
- C6 (""eventually C5"") is true because C5 already holds now (so it certainly holds eventually).
- C7 (""eventually C6"") is true for the same reason.
- C8 (""eventually C7"") is true likewise.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must determine whether C8 holds (True/False) given the context and the definitions C1–C8.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no event can occur after the initial moment.
- Therefore event2 never happens at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". This is false (event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — false, because C1 never becomes true.
- C3: same as C2 — false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is an implication P⇒P (since C2 and C3 are identical). With C2 false and C3 false, the implication is true (false⇒false is true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" There are no future states that can violate C4 (only the initial state exists and C4 is true there), so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" True, since C5 already holds now.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" True.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" True.

Final answer
True
---
Answering: C8 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step

1. Context facts:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no events (including event2) can ever happen.
   - (The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur.)

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1 = ""event2 happens"": false (event2 cannot occur).
   - C2 = ""eventually C1"": false (C1 never becomes true).
   - C3 = same as C2, so false.
   - C4 = ""if C2 then C3"". This implication is true (vacuously true because C2 is false).
   - C5 = ""C4 always holds"". Since C4 is true at every time (C2 is never true), C5 is true.
   - C6 = ""C5 eventually holds"". True, because C5 already holds now (and always), so it certainly holds at some future time.
   - C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"". True, because C6 already holds now, so it will hold at some future time.
   - C8 = ""C7 eventually holds"". By the same reasoning, true.

Therefore C8 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C7 is the statement ""If C6 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether C7 is True or False given the context (initially event2, then event1 must happen, then event2 must happen, and so on — i.e. event2 and event1 alternate forever starting with event2).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition under the alternating behavior
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False — event1 occurs every other state, not in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" False — there is never a point after which event1 holds at every subsequent state (alternation continues forever).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False (because C2 is false now and in every state).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False (C3 is false, so it cannot hold always).
- C5: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Same as C3 — False.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" False (both conjuncts are false).

Step 3 — evaluate C7
C7 is (C6 → event1). Because C6 is false in every state, the implication C6 → event1 is vacuously true. There is no state where C6 holds and event1 does not, so C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C6 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and trace behavior
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event2, event1 must happen; after any event1, event2 must happen.
- This enforces an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (starting from the initial event2).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" In the alternating run, event1 does not hold in every state (event2 occurs in half the states). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That would mean at some future point event1 holds in every subsequent state. Because events alternate forever, there is no point after which event1 holds always. So C2 is false.
- C3 / C5: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false, these are false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C6 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 is the implication ""If C6 holds, then event1 happens.""
- Since C6 is false in the actual run, the implication is vacuously true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

Conclusion
- C7 is True.
---
The hypothesis (C7) is the implication ""If C6 holds, then event1 happens.""

Examine the context and the conditions:
- From the context: events must alternate forever starting with event2: sequence is 2,1,2,1,...
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false — event1 does not occur at every point (every other step is event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" False, since C1 is never true at any point (there is no point after which only event1 happens).
- C3 / C5: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False for the same reason.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" False (both conjuncts are false).

C7 is the implication C6 ⇒ event1. An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C6 never holds in any state, the implication is true in the system.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's asked:
- We must determine whether C6 (C4 holds and C5 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions:
- Context: Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. (Also: after event2, no other events can happen.)
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. This is false because event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, so event2 cannot occur at any later time (nor before the initial event).
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds. Since C1 is false (and event2 does not happen), C2 is false.
- C3: C2 holds or event1 happens. Event1 did happen initially, so C3 is true (regardless of C2).
- C4: If C3 holds, then event1 happens. C3 is true and event1 does happen, so the implication is true.
- C5: Same as C4; it is also true.

Step 3 — final check:
- C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds"". Both C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never happens (it cannot occur after event1, and event1 already happened initially).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" False (event2 does not happen).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" True, because event1 happened.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 is true and event1 did happen, so the implication is true.
- C5: same as C4, so also true.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify given facts:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events can occur later; in particular event2 cannot occur after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (unused because event2 does not occur).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False, because event1 already happened and prevents any later events, so event2 cannot occur.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" False (event2 does not happen).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" True, because event1 happens.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline: initially (state s0) event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen, so in s0 event2 = true, event1 = false; in s1, s2, ... no events occur (event1 = event2 = false).

- C1: ""If event2 happens then event1 happens."" At s0 this is false (event2 true, event1 false).

- C2 and C3: both assert ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false at s0, C2 and C3 are false.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" C4 is true, so C5 is true.

- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" C2 is false and C5 is true, so C6 is false.

- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" In s0 the next state is s1; C6 is false there, so C7 is false.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.
---

---
Step 1 — facts from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no event1 ever occurs after the initial event2).
- After event1 no other events can happen (not directly used because event1 never occurs here).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" In the actual initial state event2 happens but event1 does not. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C3:
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already false in the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is also false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 and C5:
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" C4 holds, so C5 is true.

Step 5 — evaluate C6:
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" C2 is false, so C6 is false.

Step 6 — evaluate C7 and C8:
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial event2 (no further events can happen), so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds at every state, it certainly holds at some future (indeed the current) state — so C2 is true in every state.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 holds at every state, it holds at the next state as well. So C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Negating the false C4 yields true, so C5 is true.

6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" As above, C5 holds at every state, so it holds in the next state; C6 is true.

7. C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" C6 already holds, so C7 is true.

8. C8: ""C7 always holds."" Since C7 holds at every state, C8 (globally C7) is true.

9. C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" C8 holds at every state, so it holds at the next state; C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p -> p), so C1 is true in every state.

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, it certainly holds at some future state — so C2 is true (in fact true in every state).

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is true in every state, it is true in the next state as well. So C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 (the negation of C4) is true.

6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is true in every state, so it holds in the next state; C6 is true.

7. C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" C6 is true, so the disjunction is true; C7 is true (regardless of whether event2 actually happens).

8. C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is true in every state, so C8 is true.

9. C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" Since C8 is true in every state, it holds in the next state as well. Therefore C9 is true.

Thus C9 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:

1. From the context: initially event1 holds, and the rules “after event1, event2 must happen” and “after event2, event1 must happen” imply an infinite alternating sequence event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (so there is an infinite path).

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p). So C1 is true in every state.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds in every state, C2 is true in every state (in particular it holds now).

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 holds in every state, C3 is true in every state.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true in every state, C4 is false in every state.

6. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" As C4 is false everywhere, C5 is true everywhere.

7. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 holds in every state, so C6 is true in every state.

8. C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" C6 is true everywhere, so C7 is true in every state (regardless of whether event2 holds in a particular state).

9. C8: ""C7 always holds."" Since C7 holds in every state, C8 is true.

10. C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" Because C8 is true in every state, it certainly holds in the next state. Thus C9 is true.

Therefore, C9 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is (event2 → event2). That is a propositional tautology, so C1 holds in every state (including the initial one).

2. The initial state has event2 and, by the context, it is a terminal state (after event2 no other events can happen). So there is no next state.

3. C2 is “C1 holds in the next state” (X C1). Since there is no next state, X C1 is false in the initial state under the usual temporal semantics (next is false when no successor exists). The same applies to C3 (it is the same formula X C1), so C3 is false as well. Any formula with one or more next operators (like C4 = X C3) is false for the same reason.

4. C5 is “C4 always holds” (G C4). Because C4 is false at the initial (and only) state, C5 is false.

5. C6 is “C5 does not hold” (¬C5). Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

6. C7 is “C2 holds or C6 holds” (C2 ∨ C6). C6 is true, so C7 is true in the initial (and only) state.

7. C8 is “C7 always holds” (G C7). There is only the initial state on the trace, and C7 is true there, so G C7 is true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning (using standard linear-time semantics where Xφ (""next φ"") is false if there is no successor state, and Gφ (""always φ"") means φ holds in every state on the (unique) future path including the current state):

- The initial state s0: event2 happened. After event2 there is no successor state.

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" In s0 the antecedent and consequent are both true, so C1 is true in s0.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after s0, so ""next C1"" is false. Thus C2 is false.

3. C3: same formula as C2, so C3 is false in s0.

4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Again there is no next state, so C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false in the current (and only) state, C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

7. C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" C2 is false but C6 is true, so C7 is true in s0.

8. C8: ""C7 always holds."" The only state on the path is s0, and C7 is true there, so C8 is true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
We are asked whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true given the context.

1) Interpret the context:
- Initially event2 holds (so at the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2 no other events can happen → from the next state onward no events occur (so both event1 and event2 are false in all successor states).
- The ""after event1 ..."" clause is irrelevant because event1 never occurs here.

2) Evaluate the conditions statewise (treating ""next"" as X and ""always"" as G):
- C1: (event2 → event2). This is a tautology in every state, so C1 holds in every state.
- C2: X(C1). Since C1 holds in every state, C2 holds in every state.
- C3: same as C2, so holds everywhere.
- C4: X(C3). Since C3 holds everywhere, C4 holds everywhere.
- C5: G(C4). C4 holds in every state, so C5 is true.
- C6: ¬C5. Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: C2 ∨ C6. C2 is true, so C7 is true in every state.
- C8: G(C7). Because C7 holds in every state, C8 is true.

Therefore C8 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpret ""after"" as next-state. States: t0 (initial), t1 (next), t2 (next), ...
- From context: t0: event1. From “after event1, event2 must happen” we get t1: event2. From “after event2, event1 must happen” we get t2: event1. So events alternate: t0:event1, t1:event2, t2:event1, ...

Evaluate the Ci at t0 (we want C8, which says “C7 holds in the next state,” i.e. C7 at t1):

- C1 = (event2 or event2) ≡ event2. At t1 event2 is true; at t2 event2 is false.
- C2 = C1 holds in the next state (i.e. C1 at t1). At t0, C2 is true (since t1 has event2).
- C3 = (C2 → event2). At t0 C2 is true but event2 is false at t0, so C3 is false at t0.
- C4 = C1 holds in the next state (same as C2). At t0 C4 is true.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4. At t0 this is false ∧ true = false.
- C6 = C5 ∨ event1. At t0 event1 is true, so C6 is true.
- C7 = ¬C6. At t0 this is false.

Now C8 = “C7 holds in the next state” = (C7 at t1). Evaluate at t1:

- At t1, event1 is false and C5 is false (C4 at t1 is false because at t2 event2 is false), so C6 at t1 is false, hence C7 at t1 is true.

Therefore C8 is true (since C7 holds at t1).

Final answer:
True

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event1 occurred (call this state s0).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events occur in any state after s0. In particular, event1 does not occur in the next state s1.
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is therefore false at s0. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") requires some future state where C2 is true; since C2 is false in every future state, C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false because C3 is already false at s0. Likewise C5 is false.
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false, so C7 (C6 holds in the next state) is false, and C8 (C7 holds in the next state) is false.
- C9 is C1 and C8; since C1 is false (and C8 is false), C9 is false.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurred (time 0).
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means no events occur at any future time (t > 0). In particular, event1 does not occur in the next state (time 1).
- Therefore C1 (“Event1 happens in the next state”) is false (and so is C2). Because future occurrences never happen, all the eventual/always nested claims C3–C8 are also false.
- C9 requires C1 to hold and C8 to hold; since C1 is false, C9 is false.

False

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen.
So event2 cannot happen at any time. (Thus ""Event2 does not happen"" is true.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (same as C1).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — True (C1 is true and implies C2).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" — True (C3 holds).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — True (C3/C4 are true in all states, since C1/C2 are global).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" — True (C5 is a global/always fact, so it holds in the next state).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" — False (C6 is true).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" — False (C7 is already false).
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" — True (C8 is false, so ""does not hold"" is true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (and it did initially), nothing else can ever happen thereafter.
- After event2, no other events can happen (but since event1 already happened initially, event2 in fact does not occur at any point).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened initially and prevents any further events, event2 never occurs. So C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are true, the implication is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so the disjunction is true (holds in every state).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C3 is true globally, C4 is true in every state, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" If C5 holds globally, it also holds in the next state, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" But C6 is true, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is false, so C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is false, ""C8 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer:
True

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event1 happened. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen"", the system has no successor states — event1 is terminal. In particular event2 never happens.
2. C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true. C2 is the same statement, so true as well.
3. C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is true (true implies true).
4. C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true (both disjuncts hold).
5. C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true: there is only the initial state and C4 holds there, so C4 holds in all reachable states.
6. C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state after the terminal state; in standard temporal semantics X p (next p) is false at a state with no successor.
7. C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is therefore true.
8. C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true because C7 holds in the only state.
9. C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is the negation of a true statement, so C9 is false."

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step (evaluate all Ci at the initial state, where event2 happened and no further states exist):

1. C1 = ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" True, because event2 happened initially.
2. C2 = ""C1 does not hold."" False (negation of C1).
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds."" False, because C2 is already false now (always must hold now as well).
4. C4 = ""C3 does not hold."" True (negation of C3).
5. C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state after event2, so a ""next"" requirement fails.
6. C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state."" False (same reason).
7. C7 = ""C6 does not hold."" True (negation of false C6).
8. C8 = ""C7 does not hold."" False (negation of true C7).
9. C9 = ""Event2 happens or C8 holds."" True, because event2 happened.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Context: initially event2 happens, and both event1 and event2 are terminal (after either of them no further events occur).
- C1 = (event2 happens) or (event1 happens). At the initial state this is True (event2 happened).
- C2 = not C1. So C2 is False at the initial state.
- C3 = always(C2). Since C2 is false now, C3 is False.
- C4 = not C3. So C4 is True now.
- C5 = next(C4). Because event2 is terminal there is no next state, so next(C4) is False.
- C6 = next(C5). No second successor either, so C6 is False.
- C7 = not C6, hence True.
- C8 = not C7, hence False.
- C9 = (event2 happens) or C8. Since event2 happens at the initial state, C9 is True (the disjunction holds).

Thus C9 is True.

Reasoning:

- From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 eventually happens. (So ""event1 eventually happens"" is true.)

Now evaluate the conditions:

- C1: Event1 eventually happens. True.
- C2: Event1 eventually happens. True.
- C3: Event1 happens or C2 holds. Since C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: C3 does not hold. False (because C3 holds).
- C5: C4 always holds. False (C4 is false, so it cannot always hold).
- C6: If C5 holds, then event2 happens. This implication is vacuously true because C5 is false; an implication with false antecedent is true.
- C7: Event1 eventually happens. True.
- C8: C6 holds or C7 holds. True (both disjuncts are true).
- C9: C1 holds or C8 holds. True (C1 is true, and C8 is also true).

Therefore C9 is True.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur eventually).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (follows from initial event2 and ""after event2, event1 must happen"").
- C2: same as C1, True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (C3 holds).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" False (C4 is false).
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication is true (antecedent C5 is false → implication holds vacuously).
- C7: same as C1, True.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" True (both hold).
- C9: ""C1 holds or C8 holds."" True (C1 holds, and C8 holds).

Final answer:
True

We are asked whether C9 is True or False.

Context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 will eventually happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (not needed further).

Step-by-step through the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (from context).
- C2: same as C1 → True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is False, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" Antecedent C5 is False, so the implication is True (vacuously).
- C7: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (same as C1/C2).
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" At least C7 holds, so C8 is True.
- C9: ""C1 holds or C8 holds."" C1 holds (and C8 also holds), so C9 is True.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- From the context: event2 holds initially and no events happen after event2. Thus event1 does not hold (it cannot occur later or earlier).
- C1 (event2 -> event1) is false because event2 holds but event1 does not. So C2 and C3 (""C1 does not hold"") are true.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true because C3 already holds now (so it holds eventually).
- C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true: C4 holds now and nothing in the future can change this (no events occur after event2).
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true as well (if there is a next state, the facts remain unchanged; even if there is no next state, C2 already makes the disjunction in C7 true).
- C7 (""C2 or C6"") is therefore true (C2 is true).
- C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true because C7 holds now and cannot be falsified later.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Initially event2 happened but event1 did not; after event2 no further events can occur. So the implication ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" (C1) is false in this system (event2 occurred while event1 did not).  
- Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) and C3 (same) are true (indeed, C1 is false in every state of the trace).  
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" is true immediately (C3 holds now).  
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" is true because C3 is true in every state, so at every state F(C3) holds.  
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" is true (C5 holds in all states).  
- C7: ""C2 or C6"" is therefore true (indeed both disjuncts are true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- At the initial state s0, event1 happens (so E1 is true at s0). Event2 does not happen at s0.
- After event1 (i.e. in every successor state s1, s2, ...), no events happen: E1 and E2 are false in all later states.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True at s0 (E1 true), false in every successor state (both events false).
- C2: same as C1, so same truth values.
- C3: C1 and C2 — thus true at s0, false in every successor state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" That would require C3 to be true in every state. But C3 is false in successors, so C4 is false in every state.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false in every state, there is no future state where C4 holds, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False (C5 is false in every state, including the next).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" False.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" False.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" False.

Conclusion
C9 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Model the timeline:
   - At time 0: event1 happened (so event1 is true at time 0). event2 is false.
   - The rules say that after event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen. So for all times t > 0, neither event1 nor event2 occurs (both are false).

2. Evaluate the conditions at time 0 and later:
   - C1: ""event1 or event2"" — true at time 0 (because event1 happened), false for all t > 0.
   - C2: same as C1 — true at time 0, false afterward.
   - C3: C1 and C2 — true at time 0, false for t > 0.
   - C4: ""C3 always holds"" (globally) — false, because C3 does not hold at times t > 0.
   - C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — false, since C4 is never true at any future time.
   - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — false.
   - C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — false.
   - C8: ""C7 eventually holds"" — false.
   - C9: ""C8 eventually holds"" — false.

Since C9 is false under the given assumptions, the correct final answer is False.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

1. What is being asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C9 is true given the context.

2. Facts from the context
- Initially event1 happened. So at the initial state, event1 is true.
- After event1 no other events can happen. That means nothing changes after the initial state: the truth-values of propositions that held when event1 happened remain true thereafter (no event2 can occur later).
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 does not occur in this scenario.)

3. Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True at the initial state because event1 happened.
- C2: same as C1, so also True.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. True.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because nothing changes after the initial state, C3 is true now and remains true at every future state. So C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds (now and forever), it is certainly true that C4 will hold at some (indeed every) future time. So C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because C5 is true now and nothing changes, it is true in the next state as well. So C6 is True.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds (and will continue to hold), so C7 is True.
- C8: likewise, C8 is True.
- C9: likewise, C9 is True.

4. Conclusion
- Given event1 occurred initially and no further events can occur, all of C1–C9 evaluate to True, so C9 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"") is a tautology; it holds in every state (true when event1 does happen, and vacuously true when it does not).
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is therefore false in every state.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false everywhere, because C2 is always false.
- C4 (""C3 holds or event2 happens"") is false everywhere: C3 is false and, by the context, event2 never happens (after the initial event1 no other events can occur).
- C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true everywhere (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C6 (""C5 holds or event2 happens"") is true everywhere because C5 holds.
- C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true everywhere because C6 holds in every state.
- C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is true everywhere for the same reason.
- C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is therefore true (indeed, C8 holds immediately and at all future states).

Thus C9 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- From the context: event1 occurs at the initial state (state 0); after that no events ever occur (so event1 is false at every state >0, and event2 is false at all states).

- Evaluate the Ci at an arbitrary state s:

  - C1: ""event1 → event1"" is a propositional tautology, so C1 holds at every state.
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore false at every state.
  - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" is false (since C2 is false everywhere).
  - C4: ""C3 or event2"" is false (both disjuncts false everywhere).
  - C5: ""If C4 then event2"" is vacuously true (antecedent false), so C5 holds everywhere.
  - C6: ""C5 or event2"" is true (C5 true).
  - C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" is true (C6 true at every next state).
  - C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" is true (C7 true at every next state).

- Thus C8 holds already (at every state), so ""eventually C8"" (C9) is true.
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- At the initial state s0, event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event2 never happens at or after s0.
- (Also: “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions state by state (starting at s0)
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event1 happens.” This is a tautological implication, hence C1 is true at every state.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” Since C1 holds everywhere, C2 is false everywhere.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Because C2 is false in every state, C3 is false in every state.
- C4: “C3 holds or event2 happens.” Both disjuncts are false (C3 false everywhere, event2 never happens), so C4 is false everywhere.
- C5: “If C4 holds, then event2 happens.” The antecedent C4 is always false, so C5 is vacuously true in every state.
- C6: “C5 holds or event2 happens.” C5 is true, so C6 is true everywhere.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” Since C6 is true everywhere, C7 is true.
- C8: “C7 holds in the next state.” Since C7 is true everywhere, C8 is true.
- C9: “C8 eventually holds.” Because C8 is already true (in fact true everywhere), C9 is true.

False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happened. The context also says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So once the initial state is reached, there are no further events and in particular event2 cannot occur later.

- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens""): false, because event2 cannot happen after the initial event1.

- C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens""): true, because event1 did happen initially.

- C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens""): false — C2 is true but event2 does not happen, so the implication fails.

- C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds""): true vacuously, since event2 never happens the antecedent is false.

- C5 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens""): same as C3, so false.

- C6 (""C4 holds or C5 holds""): true because C4 is true.

- C7 (""C6 holds in the next state""): false. There is no next state (no further events can happen after the initial event1), so the requirement that C6 hold in a next state cannot be satisfied.

Therefore C7 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal — there is no successor state where any further events (including event2) can occur.

2. C1 (event2 eventually happens): False — event2 cannot happen after the initial event1, and there is no prior occurrence of event2.

3. C2 (C1 holds or event1 happens): True — event1 does happen in the initial state.

4. C3 (if C2 holds then event2 happens): False — C2 is true but event2 does not happen, so the implication fails.

5. C4 (if event2 happens then C3 holds): True — vacuously true, because event2 does not happen.

6. C5 (if C2 holds then event2 happens): Same as C3, so False.

7. C6 (C4 holds or C5 holds): True, because C4 is true.

8. C7 (C6 holds in the next state): False — there is no next state (the initial state is terminal because no further events can occur). Under the standard ""next"" semantics for terminal states, Xφ is false. Therefore C7 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — semantics and starting facts
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen (so event2 does not happen at later times).
- “After event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant because event1 never occurs (event2 already happened initially and nothing can happen after).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions (at an arbitrary time point)
- C1: (event2 → event2). This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 holds at every time.
- C2: (C1 → event2). Since C1 always holds, C2 is equivalent to event2 (i.e. C2 holds exactly at times when event2 happens).
- C3 and C4 are the same as C2, so each is equivalent to event2.
- C5: C3 ∨ C4 is then equivalent to event2.
- C6: C2 ∨ C5 is equivalent to event2.
- So C6 holds exactly at times when event2 happens.

Step 3 — C7: “C6 always holds”
- C7 asserts that C6 is true at all times, i.e. event2 happens at all times.
- But event2 only happened initially and (by the context) does not happen at later times. So C6 is not true at later times.
- Therefore C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
You ask whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 holds (indeed it holds in every state).

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent (C1 holds) is true, and the context states event2 happened initially, so C2 is true in the initial state.

3. C3 and C4 are the same as C2, so they also hold. Therefore C5 (C3 or C4) holds, and C6 (C2 or C5) holds as well.

4. C7: ""C6 always holds."" We must check C6 in every reachable state. The context says that after event2 no other events can happen, so the initial state (where event2 holds and hence C6 holds) is terminal — there are no future states where C6 could fail. Therefore C6 holds in all reachable states, so C7 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 holds.
- C2, C3, C4: each is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds, each of C2, C3, C4 is equivalent to asserting that event2 happens.
- From the context, event2 happened initially, so ""event2 happens"" is true. Therefore C2, C3, and C4 all hold.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" True, because C3 and C4 hold.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" True, because C2 and C5 hold.

Step 3 — the ""always"" in C7 and event sequencing
- C7 states that C6 always holds. From the above, C6 holds now.
- The context also says that after event2 no other events can happen, so there are no future events that could change the truth of these propositions. Thus C6 cannot become false later.

Conclusion
- C6 holds and cannot be invalidated by any future event, so C7 is True.

- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur in any future state.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs after the initial event1).

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 happens initially, no further events (including event2) can ever occur. Therefore statement C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

2. C2, C3 and C5 all state ""C1 eventually holds"" (they are the same formula). Because C1 already holds (event2 never happens), C1 certainly holds now and hence ""eventually C1"" holds as well. So C2, C3 and C5 are true.

3. C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical and both true, C4 is true.

4. C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because C5 (C1 eventually holds) is true in every state (event2 never happens at any future point), it also holds in the next state. So C6 is true.

5. C7 is ""If C4 holds, then C6 holds."" Both antecedent C4 and consequent C6 are true, so the implication C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C4 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 can never happen.
- (Also: if event2 ever happened then event1 must happen afterwards — irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is already true, ""eventually C1"" is true.
- C3: same as C2, so true.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Both sides are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2/C3, so true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because event2 never happens, C1 remains true in the next state, so C5 still holds there; thus C6 is true.
- C7: ""If C4 holds, then C6 holds."" We have C4 true and C6 true, so the implication C7 is true.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step by step):

- Context gives that initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So every possible execution starts with event1 and then stops.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): true, because in every execution (the only ones allowed by the context) event1 has occurred.
- C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds""): true, since event1 did happen and C1 is true.
- C3 and C4 are the same as C2, so both are true.
- C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds""): true (both conjuncts true).
- C6 (""C2 holds or C5 holds""): true (both disjuncts true).
- C7 (""C6 always holds""): true, because in every execution (and at every time in those executions) C6 holds.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:

- From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event1 occurs only at the initial moment; it does not occur at every later moment.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is therefore false — event1 does not hold at all times, only initially.
- C2, C3, C4 each require C1 to hold (they assert ""Event1 happens and C1 holds""), so they are all false because C1 is false.
- C5 (C3 and C4) is false (both conjuncts false). C6 (C2 or C5) is false (both disjuncts false).
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false because C6 is already false in the initial (and only) state.

Thus C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. Treat ""event1 happened"" as a fact that holds from the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, nothing else can occur (in particular event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).
- Thus event1 occurs in every possible execution and its occurrence persists; there is no way to avoid event1.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event1 happened initially and no events can prevent it or occur instead, C1 holds.
- C2, C3, C4: each is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since event1 happens and C1 holds, C2, C3, C4 all hold.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 holds.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" At least one of them holds (in fact both), so C6 holds.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is built from facts that are true persistently (event1 happened and C1), so C6 holds at all times; therefore C7 holds.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C8 is true or false. We'll evaluate the conditions step by step given the context.

Context summary
- Initially, event1 has happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no event2 or any other event can occur in any subsequent state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, some later state must have event1).

Because event1 has already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 can never occur at any time.

Evaluate the Ci's at the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — since event1 already happened and after event1 no events can happen, it does not occur in the next state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are false (event2 cannot happen; C1 is false), so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is false, but event1 did happen initially, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 is false, C4 true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false now, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" Both false, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""Event2 happens or C7 holds."" Both are false, so C8 is false.

Conclusion: C8 is False.
---
You ask whether C8 is true given:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context, event1 has already happened initially. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no events can occur in any state following that initial state. Thus event2 cannot occur at any later time.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That is false, because after the initial event1 no further events (including event1 again) can happen.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are false (event2 cannot happen; C1 is false) → C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 → false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Event1 has happened (initially), so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 is false, so C5 is false (even though C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" Both false → C7 is false.
- C8: ""Event2 happens or C7 holds."" Both false → C8 is false.

Conclusion: C8 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- The initial situation: event1 has happened, and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event2 and any further event1) occur after that initial state. So the only event that ever occurs is the initial event1; event2 never occurs in any later state.
- Evaluate the conditions at the initial state:

  C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — the next state has no events.

  C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" False — event2 does not happen and C1 is false.

  C3: same as C2, so False.

  C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" True — event1 happens in the initial state.

  C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" False — event2 does not happen.

  C6: ""C5 always holds."" False — C5 is already false at the initial state.

  C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" False — both are false.

  C8: ""Event2 happens or C7 holds."" False — neither holds.

False"

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 already happened. The context also says that after event1 no other events can happen, so event1 does not (and cannot) occur again in a subsequent state.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" That is false (it happened initially but will not happen in the next state).
- C2, C3, C4: each is ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false at the next state, these are false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" This is false because C2 is false (false AND true = false).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C2 can never become true (C1 cannot hold in future states), C6 can never become true, so C7 is false.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C7 (""eventually C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened (so at the initial state s0, event1 is true). Also: after event1, no other events can happen (so no future state after s0 can have any event occur).
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
- C2, C3, C4: each says ""always C1"" (G C1).
- C5: C3 → C4 (i.e. G C1 → G C1, a tautological implication).
- C6: C2 ∧ C5 (so effectively C6 ≡ G C1 ∧ (tautology) ≡ G C1).
- C7: eventually C6 (F C6).

Step 3 — trace the possible states
At s0: event1 is true. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no future state can have event1 (or any other event) true. In particular, in the next state s1 event1 is false. Thus C1 (X event1) is false at s0. Since C1 fails at s0, ""always C1"" (C2, C3, C4) is false. C5 (C3 → C4) is vacuously true if antecedent false, but C6 = C2 ∧ C5 is false because C2 is false. Therefore C6 never becomes true at any future point, so ""eventually C6"" is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C8 (""C2 holds or C7 holds"") is true given the scenario:
- s0: initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so s1 has event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen → no further events after s1.

Interpret ""in the next state"" as referring to the immediate successor state, and ""always"" as holding in all states along the run.

Evaluate the conditions on the sequence s0 → s1 → (no further events):

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
  - At s0 this is true (s1 has event2).  
  - At s1 this is false (there is no later event2 in the successor state).

- C2: ""C1 always holds.""  
  - This requires C1 true in every state. Since C1 is false in s1, C2 is false.

- C3: same as C1, so same truth values.

- C4: same as C2, so false.

- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""  
  - At s0: C3 holds but C4 does not, so C5 is false at s0. (Thus C5 does not hold globally.)

- C6: ""C5 always holds.""  
  - Since C5 is false at s0, C6 is false.

- C7: ""C6 always holds.""  
  - Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

- C8: ""C2 holds or C7 holds.""  
  - Both C2 and C7 are false, so C8 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C8 is C2 OR C7. We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the atomic claim
- Timeline: s0 (initial) where event1 happened; by the context, in the next state s1 event2 must happen; after event2 (i.e. after s1) no other events can happen (so s2 exists but event2 does not occur there).
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 this is true (event2 happens at s1). At s1 this is false (no event2 at s2). So C1 is not true in all states, only at s0.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C7
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. C1 is true in every state). Since C1 is false at s1, C2 is false.
- C3 = C1, so C3 is true at s0 and false at s1.
- C4 = C1 always holds, so C4 = C2, and is false.
- C5 = (C3 -> C4). At s0 C3 is true but C4 is false, so the implication is false at s0. Hence C5 is false (not satisfied at s0).
- C6 = C5 always holds, so C6 is false (because C5 is false at s0).
- C7 = C6 always holds, so C7 is also false.

Step 4 — conclude C8
- C8 = C2 OR C7 = false OR false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — translate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1).
- C3: same as C1 (X event2).
- C4: same as C2 (G C1).
- C5: ""If C3 holds then C4 holds"" i.e. (X event2) -> (G C1).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" (G C5).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" (G(G C5)) — which is equivalent to G C5.
- C8: C2 or C7, i.e. (G C1) ∨ (G C5).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. So in the initial state s0, X event2 is true (C1/C3 true at s0).
- After event2 no other events can happen, so the state after event2 is terminal (there is no further transition), hence in that state X event2 is false and G C1 fails (because G C1 requires X event2 to hold in every state).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C7
- C2 (G C1) is false because in the state after event2 there is no next event, so X event2 is false there.
- C5 = (X event2) -> (G C1). At s0 the antecedent X event2 is true, but the consequent G C1 is false (as just shown), so C5 is false at s0. Hence G C5 (and therefore G(G C5)) is false. So C7 is false.
- Therefore both disjuncts of C8 are false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — model the timeline
- Initial state s0: event2 happened (so E2 is true at s0).  
- After event2 no other events can happen, so in the next state s1 and all subsequent states no events happen (E2 false in s1, s2, ...).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions per state

At s0:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" → false (E2 true at s0).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" → false or true = true.
- C3: same as C2 → true.
- C4: ""If C2 then C3"" → true → true.
- C5: ""Event2 does not happen"" → false.
- C6: ""C4 or C5"" → true or false = true.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" → need C6 at s1 (see below).
  (So C7 at s0 is true iff C6 is true at s1.)

At s1 (and all later states; E2 = false):
- C1: true (E2 false).
- C2: true (C1 true or E2 false → true).
- C3: true.
- C4: true (C2 → C3).
- C5: true (E2 does not happen).
- C6: true (C4 or C5).
Thus C6 is true at s1, so C7 is true at s0. Also C7 is true at s1 (because C6 is true at s2), and so on.

Step 3 — evaluate C8
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 already holds at s0 (and at s1, ...), so C8 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event2 happened.
2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false (since event2 did happen).
3. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — true (because event2 happens).
4. C3: same as C2 — true.
5. C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" — true (antecedent and consequent are true).
6. C5: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false (same as C1).
7. C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — true (because C4 is true).
8. Consider the next state: by the context no events occur there, so event2 does not happen in the next state. Then
   - C2 and C3 (which require event2 at that state) are false in the next state,
   - C4 (""if C2 then C3"") is vacuously true in the next state,
   - C5 is false,
   - hence C6 is true in the next state.
9. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — true at the initial state (we just showed C6 holds in the next state).
10. C8: ""C7 eventually holds"" — true (C7 already holds at the initial moment, so it holds eventually).

Therefore C8 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event2 happened, so the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false in the initial state.
- C2 = (C1 or event2 happens). Because event2 did happen initially, C2 is true in the initial state. Likewise C3 is the same and is true.
- C4 = (if C2 then C3). Since C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true in the initial state.
- C5 is the same as C1, so false in the initial state.
- C6 = (C4 or C5). With C4 true, C6 is true in the initial state.
- C7 says ""C6 holds in the next state."" Evaluate the next state: after event2 no events can happen, so in that next state ""event2 does not happen"" is true. Thus in the next state C1 (and hence C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all true. Therefore C6 does hold in the next state, so C7 is true (already).
- C8 says ""C7 eventually holds."" Since C7 already holds (in fact in the initial state we just found C7 true), C8 is satisfied.

Therefore C8 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must determine whether C7 (""Event2 happens or C6 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred already.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus no event (including event2) can occur after that initial event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen. That would require event1 to occur after event2, but that’s impossible because once event1 has happened, no further events can occur. Therefore event2 cannot occur in any timeline consistent with the context.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True (event1 does happen and C1 is true).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" True (both disjuncts are true).
- C4: same as C3, so True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True (C4 holds now, so it eventually holds).
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" True (both are true).

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 is ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" Event2 cannot happen, but C6 holds. A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true, so C7 is true.

Final answer: True
---
What is being asked
- C7 asserts ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context and the other conditions C1–C6.

Step-by-step evaluation
1. From the context: initially event1 has happened. So event1 is true at the start.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So no events occur after that point (irrelevant here except to note event2 cannot occur after event1).
3. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since event1 already happened initially, C1 is satisfied (the event has occurred).
4. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does happen and C1 is true, so C2 is true.
5. C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Both disjuncts are true, so C3 is true.
6. C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
7. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds, so C5 is true.
8. C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.
9. C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" C6 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 ever happens.

Conclusion
- C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has already happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 (or any other event) cannot occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied because event2 cannot occur (given the second fact).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, since event1 has already happened initially.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True, because C1 is true (so the implication holds).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" True (both disjuncts are true).
- C4: same as C3 → True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True, C4 already holds now, so it eventually holds.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" True (both are true).
- C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" Event2 cannot happen (because event1 already happened and no events can happen after it), but C6 holds, so the disjunction is true.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

1) Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system has a single reachable state (the initial state where event1 has happened); there are no future transitions.

2) C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.

3) C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true.

4) C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 has happened in the initial (and only) state, so C3 is true in that state.

5) C4: ""C3 always holds."" There are no other states, so because C3 holds in the only state, C4 is true.

6) C5: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so C5 is true.

7) C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true in the only state.

8) C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 holds in the only reachable state, so C7 is true.

9) C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" Since C7 holds now (indeed always), it certainly holds at some (the current) point — so C8 is true.

Final answer: True
---
First, what is being asked: is C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") true given the context?

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, event2 can never happen at any time.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (event2 → event2) so C1 is true in every state.

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 is true in every state, G(C1) (C2) is true.

- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 holds in every state (even where event1 does not).

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 holds in every state, G(C3) (C4) is true.

- C5: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2; true.

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 holds.

- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is true in every state, G(C6) (C7) is true.

- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 already holds now (and everywhere), so ""eventually C7"" is true.

Conclusion: C8 is True.
---
Step 1 — Interpret the context:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So event2 never happens (there is no time after the initial event at which event2 can occur).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 holds in every state (and event1 also happened initially).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" True, because C3 holds in every state.
- C5: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both parts are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C4 and C5 are global truths, C6 holds in every state, so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" If C7 holds always, then it certainly holds at some future time — so C8 is true.

True"

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context gives that initially event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the current/initial state) and that after event2 no other events can happen. Thus there are no future states in which an event occurs again.
- C1 and C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since no events occur after the initial event2, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 and C2 are false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is already false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never holds in any future state, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is false, C6 is false.
- C7, C8, C9 are all built from falsehoods (eventual/always of false statements) and therefore are false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
We are given:
- Initial state S0: event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → S0 has no successor (no next state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant because event1 does not occur).

Evaluate the Cs at S0:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" → requires a successor state. There is no successor, so C1 is false.
2. C2: same as C1 → false.
3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" → requires a successor in which C2 holds; no successor → false.
4. C4: ""C1 or C3"" → false or false → false.
5. C5: ""Eventually C4"" (F C4) → there is no future state and C4 is false now, so F C4 is false.
6. C6: ""Always C5"" (G C5) → requires C5 true now; C5 is false → C6 false.
7. C7: ""Eventually C6"" → C6 false now and no future → false.
8. C8: ""Eventually C7"" → false.
9. C9: ""Eventually C8"" → false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 has occurred.
- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. So in every future state no event (neither event1 nor event2) occurs.
- C1 and C2 assert ""event2 happens in the next state."" Because no events can happen after the initial event2, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" — since C2 is false in the next state, C3 is false.
- C4 is C1 or C3 — both are false, so C4 is false.
- C5 says C4 eventually holds. C4 never holds (no events ever happen), so C5 is false.
- C6 is ""C5 always holds"" — false because C5 is false now.
- C7, C8, C9 are ""eventually"" iterations of a false fact, so they remain false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C8: ""If C2 holds, then C7 holds."" We must decide whether this implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happens (so event1 occurs at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur after it).

From the first two points, event1 happens initially and then no other events can occur at any later time. Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after it, event2 can never occur at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate the relevant conditions
- C1 (event1 happens and event1 happens): true (event1 does happen initially).
- C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens): requires event2 — impossible given the context, so C2 is false.
- C3, C5, C6, C7 all depend on event2 (directly or indirectly), so C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false because C6 can never be made true without event2.

Step 4 — evaluate C8
- C8 is an implication ""if C2 then C7"". Since C2 is impossible (false) under the context, the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (there is an event1 at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events can occur after that initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 occurs at some time).

Because event1 already occurs initially and no events can occur after it, event2 cannot occur at any time in this scenario.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" True (event1 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" False (requires event2, which cannot occur).
- C3: same as C2 — False.
- C4: same as C1 — True.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" False (C3 is false).
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" False (C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" False (C6 is false and cannot become true later).
- C8: ""If C2 holds, then C7 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C2 is false, C8 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 has already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 never happens.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: event1 happens and event1 happens — true (event1 did happen).
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens — false (event2 never happens).
- C3: same as C2 — false.
- C4: same as C1 — true.
- C5: C3 and C4 — false (C3 is false).
- C6: C5 and event1 — false (C5 is false).
- C7: eventually C6 holds — false (C6 never becomes true).
- C8: if C2 holds then C7 holds — an implication. Since C2 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C7 (C3 holds or C6 holds) is true given the scenario and the definitions of C1–C6.

Step 2 — interpret the context
Initially event2 occurs. After any event2, event1 occurs next; after any event1, event2 occurs next. So states alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... Hence in every state either event1 or event2 happens (indeed exactly one happens in each state under this interpretation).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the alternation, C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C1 is true in the next state as well, so C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds now (indeed always), C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" C4 is true; C5 is true in those states where event1 happens (i.e., every other state).
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to saying event1 happens and C4 holds; so C6 is true in states where event1 happens.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" Since C3 is already true (globally), C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
We are asked whether C7 is true in the given system (initial state: event2; events must alternate: after event2 → event1, after event1 → event2).

Evaluate the conditions at the initial state:

- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" At the initial state event2 happens, so C1 = True.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In the next state event1 happens, so C1 is true there; hence C2 = True (already true at the initial state because the next-state condition holds).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 = True.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 = True.
- C5: ""event1 happens and C4 holds."" At the initial state event1 does not happen (event2 does), so C5 = False.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" C5 is False, so C6 = False.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" C3 is True, so C7 = True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C7 (C3 holds or C6 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- So events alternate forever: event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the alternating behavior, in every state some event (event1 or event2) occurs, so C1 holds in any next state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 holds in the next state, C2 is true (indeed it holds now).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds now, C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" At the initial state event1 does not happen (event2 did), so C5 is false at the initial state (though event1 does happen in the next state).
- C6: requires C5 and event1 — since C5 is false, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" C3 is true, so C7 is true regardless of C6.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C8 is true or false.

From the context: event1 happens (initially), and then event2 must happen; thus event1 does happen.

Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False.
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is True.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" C2 is false, so the implication is True.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" C1 is false, C5 is true, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""C3 does not hold."" Same as C4, so True.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" Both C6 and C7 are True, so C8 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Event1 happened (so E1 = True).
- After event1, event2 must happen → Event2 will occur (E2 = True).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant for these Cs besides confirming no further events).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition given E1 = True
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" → False.
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen"" → False.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen"" → False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = not C3. Since C3 is False, C4 = True.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" = (C2 → C4). C2 is False, so the implication is True.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds"" = C1 ∨ C5 = False ∨ True = True.
- C7: ""C3 does not hold"" = not C3 = True.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds"" = True ∨ True = True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C8 (""C6 holds or C7 holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — translate the context into truth of ""Event1""
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2 no other events can happen.""
- Therefore event1 did happen (true), and event2 also happens later, but nothing after that matters for these conditions.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (since event1 did happen).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: same as C1 — false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C3 does not hold is true → C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" C2 is false, so the implication is true (false → anything is true).
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" C1 is false, C5 is true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C3 does not hold."" Same as C4, so C7 is true.

Answering question: is C9 True or False?

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never occurs at any time (because event1 already happened initially and blocks further events).
- C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false (event1 did happen initially).
- C2 (""if C1 then event2"") is vacuously true because C1 is false.
- C3 (""if event2 then C2"") is true at every time because event2 never happens (implication with false antecedent).
- C4 = next(C3), C5 = next(C4) = next^2(C3), C6 = next(C5) = next^3(C3). Since C3 holds at every time, C4, C5, C6 all hold at the corresponding times (in fact they are true wherever evaluated).
- C7 = C6 and event1 happens. At the initial time event1 happens and, as just argued, C6 holds (because C3 holds in all future times), so C7 holds already at the initial time.
- C8 = eventually C7 is therefore true (it holds now, so it will eventually hold).
- C9 = eventually C8 is also true (same reason).

Final answer:
True

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- At time 0 (initially) event2 has happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means: once event2 occurs, there are no events in any later state (so event1 cannot occur at any future time).
- (The clause ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 will never occur given the previous point.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given event2 already happened initially and no events can happen afterward, event1 never happens. So C1 is false.
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also false.

Step 3 — propagate to C3..C8
- C3 = (C2 holds) AND (event2 happens). C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5 = ""C4 always holds"" — false (because C4 is false at some state).
- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" — false.
- C7 = C1 AND C6 — false.
- C8 = C7 AND event2 happens — false.

Step 4 — C9
- C9 = ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- At the initial state event2 has happened.
- Rule A: If event1 occurs at some point, then event2 must occur afterwards.
- Rule B: Once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — consequences for event1
- Because event2 already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur after the initial state. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any future time (unless it had already occurred before the initial state, which is not stated). So ""event1 eventually happens"" is false.

Step 3 — evaluate the claims
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — False.
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" — C2 is false, so C3 is False (even though event2 did happen).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" — C3 is false now and cannot become true (no future events), so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — False (C4 is already false).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" — False.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" — Both parts are false, so C7 is False.
- C8: ""C7 holds and event2 happens."" — C7 is false, so C8 is False.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" — Since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: event2 happens initially. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event1) can occur in any state after the initial one. Therefore event1 never occurs at any time.

- C1 and C2: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — both are false (event1 never happens).

- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — C2 is false, so C3 is false (even though event2 did happen initially).

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C3 is false, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — C4 is false, so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — C5 is false, so C6 is false.

- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds"" — both conjuncts false, so C7 is false.

- C8: ""C7 holds and event2 happens"" — C7 is false, so C8 is false.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Thus C9 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after either event1 or event2 occurs, no other events can happen afterward. Thus once event2 happened initially, no events (including event1) can occur in any later state.

2. C1 and C2: ""Event1 always happens."" Given that event2 happens initially and prevents any further events, event1 does not hold in all states. So C1 and C2 are false.

3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Because C2 is false, this implication is vacuously true. So C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true in every state (it depends on the global false C2), so C4 is true.

5. C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 does happen initially and C4 holds, so C5 is true in the initial state.

6. C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" True in the initial state (event2 happens).

7. C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" C1 is false, so C7 is false.

8. C8: ""C7 holds or event2 happens."" In the initial state this is true because event2 happens.

9. C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" In the next state after the initial one, no events can happen (by the given rule after event2). So event2 does not hold in the next state. Also C1 (event1 always happens) is false, making C7 false, and C5 (which required event2) is false there as well, so C6 is false in that next state. Hence C7 is false and event2 is false in the next state, so C8 is false in the next state. Therefore C9 is false.

Conclusion: C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — initial facts
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen → there is no next/state successor after the initial state (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False (event2 happened instead; event1 does not occur).
- C2: same as C1 → False.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true in the only existing state, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 is true and C4 is true → C5 is true.
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" True (event2 happens).
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" C1 is false → C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 holds or event2 happens."" Event2 happens → C8 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C9
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (event2 is terminal), and under standard temporal semantics the ""next"" operator is false when no successor exists. Therefore C9 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. In particular event1 does not happen initially and never happens later.
- C1 (Event1 always happens) and C2 (same) are therefore false.
- C3 (if C2 then event1) is true (vacuously, because C2 is false). C4 (C3 always holds) is true.
- C5 (event2 and C4) is true in the initial state (event2 did happen and C4 holds). C6 (event2 or C5) is true initially. C7 (C1 and C6) is false (C1 is false). C8 (C7 or event2) is true in the initial state because event2 holds.
- Consider the next state: since after event2 no further events can happen, event2 does not happen in the next state. C5 is false there, so C6 is false, C7 remains false, and therefore C8 is false in the next state.
- C9 asserts that C8 holds in the next state; but we just found C8 is false in the next state.

Therefore C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C8 (C6 holds or C7 holds) is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Timeline: at time 0, event1 happened.
- After any event1, event2 must happen next; after any event2, event1 must happen next.
- So the actual sequence is event1 at t0, event2 at t1, event1 at t2, event2 at t3, … (an infinite alternation).
- Consequence: event2 does occur (infinite times), but it does not hold at every time instant (it is not true at t0, and it never holds continuously because each event2 is followed by event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting “always” as “at every time” (globally) — this is false (event2 is false at t0 and not continuously true).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” That is, there exists a time from which C2 is true (from that time onward event2 would always hold). Because of the strict alternation, there is no time after which event2 holds at every subsequent moment, so C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: “If C1 holds, then C4 holds.” An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true (C1 is false, so C1 → C4 is true).
- C6: “C5 holds and event1 happens.” C5 is true and event1 does happen (initially), so C6 is true.
- C7: “C2 eventually holds.” Same as C3, so false.
- C8: “C6 holds or C7 holds.” C6 is true, C7 is false, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: events alternate starting with event1 — sequence is event1, event2, event1, event2, ... So event2 occurs (in fact infinitely often) but not at every moment (there are moments when event1 holds).
- C1 and C2 (""Event2 always happens"" interpreted as ""event2 holds at every moment"") are false.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., event2 will occur at some future time) is true.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.
- C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is true (the implication is true because C1 is false).
- C6 (""C5 holds and event1 happens"") is true (C5 is true and event1 does happen initially).
- C7 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true (same as C3).
- Therefore C8 (""C6 or C7"") is true (both disjuncts are true).
---
Reasoning (step by step):

- The context gives an infinite alternating trace starting with event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- Interpret ""always"" as the usual global (G) notion: ""Event2 always happens"" means G(event2) (i.e. event2 holds at every time point). Under the alternating trace G(event2) is false (there are steps where event1 holds instead).
- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: Event2 always happens — false.
  - C2: Event2 always happens — false (same as C1).
  - C3: C2 eventually holds — false (there is no future point from which C2 = G(event2) becomes true).
  - C4: C3 does not hold — true (negation of the false C3).
  - C5: If C1 holds, then C4 holds — true (implication with a false antecedent is true; additionally C4 is true anyway).
  - C6: C5 holds and event1 happens — true (C5 is true and event1 did happen initially).
  - C7: C2 eventually holds — false (same as C3).
  - C8: C6 holds or C7 holds — true (since C6 is true).

Sample responses:
Identify the question:
- C9 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then C8 holds.""
- C8 is ""Event1 happens or C7 holds.""

Examine the implication:
- C9 is therefore ""event1 -> (event1 ∨ C7).""
- For any proposition P and Q, P -> (P ∨ Q) is a tautology (whenever P is true, P ∨ Q is automatically true; if P is false the implication is vacuously true).

Conclusion:
- C9 is always true, independent of the other conditions.

True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C9 is the formula: (event1 happens) -> C8.
- C8 is: (event1 happens) OR C7.
- So C9 is A -> (A OR B) where A = ""event1 happens"" and B = C7.
- For any Boolean A and B, A -> (A OR B) is always true:
  - If A is true, then A OR B is true, so the implication holds.
  - If A is false, the implication holds vacuously.
- Therefore C9 is a tautology and must be True (independent of the context and of C7).
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C9 is the implication: ""If event1 happens, then C8 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context and the definitions of the Ci.

Step 2 — examine C8 and C9
C8 is ""Event1 happens or C7 holds."" So C9 is logically: event1 -> (event1 or C7).

Step 3 — logical reasoning
For any proposition A and any B, A -> (A or B) is a tautology: if A is true then A or B is true. Therefore whenever event1 happens, C8 (event1 or C7) necessarily holds, independent of the other conditions or the context.

Step 4 — use of context (optional check)
The context (initial event1, no events after event1, etc.) does not change that implication—indeed event1 occurs initially so C8 is true there, and in any state where event1 holds the disjunction holds.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: event1 has happened initially, event2 must happen after event1, and after event2 nothing else can happen. So both event1 and event2 do occur (with event2 following event1).

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True.

- C2 and C3: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 does hold (event2 will happen and then both have occurred), ""eventually C1"" is true. So C2 and C3 are true.

- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" True (both are true).

- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true at all times (the claim that C1 will eventually hold is true before and after C1 actually holds), so C5 is true.

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 always holds, then it certainly holds at some time, so C6 is true.

- C7: ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds."" Event1 does happen and C6 is true, so the implication in C7 is true; hence C7 holds.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This is false because C7 does hold.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: event1 happens initially, and then event2 must happen, and after event2 no other events occur. So both event1 and event2 do occur in the trace.
2. C1 (""event1 happens and event2 happens"") is true.
3. C2 and C3 (""C1 eventually holds"") are true because C1 does hold in the trace.
4. C4 (C2 or C3) is therefore true.
5. C5 (C4 always holds) is true since C4 is a true statement about the trace.
6. C6 (C5 eventually holds) is true (an always-true property certainly holds eventually).
7. C7 (""If event1 happens, then C6 holds"") is true because event1 does happen and C6 holds.
8. C8 asserts that C7 does not hold; since C7 does hold, C8 is false.

Thus C8 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state (call it s0): event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → there are no successor states of s0.
- (After event2 no other events can happen is irrelevant because event2 does not occur.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in s0
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" There is no next state after s0, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false in s0, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is true, so C4 is false.
- C5: same as C1 → false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" → false ∧ false = false.
- C7: same as C1 → false.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds"" → false ∨ false = false.

Step 3 — evaluate C9
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" To be true, C8 must hold in s0 or some future state. C8 is false in s0 and there are no future states (no successors), so C8 never holds.

Final answer:
False
---
Step-by-step:

Context: Initially event1 has happened. The context also says “after event1, no other events can happen.” So we are currently in a state after event1, and there are no possible future events/states where events occur.

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” False (no events can happen after event1).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” False (C1 is already false).
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” True (C2 is false).
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” False (C3 is true).
- C5: “Event1 happens in the next state.” False (same as C1).
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds.” False (both conjuncts false).
- C7: “Event1 happens in the next state.” False (same as C1).
- C8: “C6 holds or C7 holds.” False (both disjuncts false).
- C9: “C8 eventually holds.” False (C8 is false now and there are no future states in which it can become true).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal: there is no next state.

Step 2 — evaluate the basic proposition C1
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Because there is no next state, C1 is false in the initial state.

Step 3 — propagate through the conditions
- C2 = ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false now, C2 is false.
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 is true.
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold."" So C4 is false.
- C5 = same as C1, so false.
- C6 = C4 and C5 = false.
- C7 = same as C1, so false.
- C8 = C6 or C7 = false.
  (Note: algebraically C8 reduces to C1, which we already found false.)
- C9 = ""C8 eventually holds."" Since C8 is false now and there are no future states in which it could become true, C9 is false.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Let s0 be the initial state. By context, event1 happened at s0.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" ⇒ at s1 and all later states there are no events (neither event1 nor event2).
- Evaluate the Ci at s0:
  - C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — at s0 this is false because s1 has no events.
  - C2 = C1 ∨ event1 — at s0 this is true (event1 holds at s0).
  - C3 = C1 ∨ event1 — same as C2, so true at s0.
  - C4 = ¬C3 — false at s0.
  - C5 = always C4 — at s0 this is false because C4 is false at s0 (but see next).
  - C6 = next C5 — true at s0 because at s1, C5 holds: from s1 onward there are no events, so C1 and event1 are false at all those states, hence C3 is false at all those states, so C4 is true everywhere from s1 on, so C5 (always C4) holds at s1.
  - Therefore C7 = C2 ∧ C6 is true at s0.
- C8 is the implication ""if event2 happens, then C7 holds."" Event2 does not happen at s0 (and it never happens at any state because event1 at s0 prevents further events), so the implication is true (vacuously where event2 is false), and in particular C7 does hold at s0 as shown.
- Thus C8 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Label states: s0 = initial state, s1 = next state, s2 = next after that.
   - Given: event2 happens at s0.
   - Given rules: after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2.
   - So events: s0: event2; s1: event1; s2: event2; etc.

2. Evaluate the Ci at s0:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" = event2 at s1. That is false (s1 has event1).
   - C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" = (if event1 at s0 then event2 at s1). At s0 event1 does not occur, so C2 is vacuously true.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = C2 evaluated at s1. At s1, event1 does occur and C1 evaluated at s1 asks for event2 at s2, which does occur. Thus C2 holds at s1, so C3 is true at s0.
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = negation of C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = negation of C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
   - C6: same as C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds""). As before, at s0 this is vacuously true.
   - C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds"" = true or true = true.
   - C8: ""Event2 happens and C7 holds"" = (event2 at s0) and (C7 true) = true and true = true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
Step 1 — timeline from the context:
- t=0 (initial): event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen ⇒ t=1: event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ t=2: event2.
So events alternate: t=0: e2, t=1: e1, t=2: e2, ...

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci at t=0 (the initial state):
- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state""): at t=0 this means event2 at t=1 — false (t=1 has event1). But C1 will be used relative to other times below.
- C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds""): at t=1, event1 does happen, and C1 at t=1 means event2 at t=2, which is true. So C2 is true at t=1.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): at t=0 this says C2 holds at t=1 — true (from above).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold""): at t=0 this is the negation of C3 at t=0; since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold""): negation of C4 at t=0; since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds""): at t=0, event1 does not happen, so the implication is vacuously true — C6 is true at t=0.
- C7 (""C5 holds or C6 holds""): at t=0, C5 is true and C6 is true, so C7 is true.
- C8 (""Event2 happens and C7 holds""): at t=0, event2 happens and C7 holds, so C8 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — model the timeline
- Let s0 be the initial state. s0: event2 happened.
- From the rules: after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So
  - s1: event1
  - s2: event2
  - s3: event1, etc.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at s0

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state is s1, which has event1, so C1 is False at s0.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" At s0 event1 does not happen, so the implication is True (vacuously).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At s1 we check C2: at s1 event1 is true and C1 (relative to s1) is true because s2 has event2. So C2 is True at s1, hence C3 is True at s0.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is False, so C5 is True.
- C6: same as C2, so C6 is True at s0 (vacuously).
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" At least C5 holds, so C7 is True.
- C8: ""Event2 happens and C7 holds."" At s0 event2 did happen and C7 is True, so C8 is True.

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (C5 holds and C6 holds) is true given the event rules and the listed conditions.

Understand the event sequence
- Initially event1 occurs (time 0).
- After event1, event2 must happen → at time 1 event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → at time 2 event1.
- Thus events alternate: event1 at even times, event2 at odd times. Event2 occurs infinitely often but not at every time.

Examine each condition (evaluated at the initial state)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False — at time 0 event1 happens, so event2 is not true at every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" False — C1 is false, so the conjunction is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" False — there are states (odd times) where event2 happens but C2 is false, so the implication is false at those states.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" False — C3 is false in every state, so in the next state it's false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" False — C4 never holds, so it does not hold eventually.
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is the same as C3, so False.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C7 is False.

Final answer
False
---

---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the events alternate starting with event1: at the initial state event1 happens, then event2 must happen, then event1, then event2, … So event2 occurs sometimes (every other state) but not in all states.

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false because there are states (those where event1 happens) in which event2 does not happen.

3. C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is an implication. In any state where event2 happens C2 is false, so the implication is false in those states. Therefore C3 is false (it does not hold globally).

5. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 is false in states where event2 occurs (and such states occur), C3 will not hold in the next state when that next state has event2, so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never holds, so C5 is false.

7. C6: same as C3, so false.

8. C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Sample responses:

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context: initial state s0: event1 happened. By the rule, event2 must happen afterwards, so next state s1: event2 happened. After event2 no further events occur.

- C7 says: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — so we must check C6 in s1.

- C6 is ""If C3 holds, then C5 holds."" An implication is true if its antecedent is false (vacuously true) or its consequent is true.

- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., C2 holds in all future states from the point of evaluation). C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" In s1, event1 does not hold (it held only in s0), so C2 is false in s1; therefore C3 is false in s1.

- Because C3 (the antecedent of C6) is false in s1, C6 is true in s1 (vacuously). Thus C6 holds in the next state, so C7 is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Timeline from the context: s0 (initial) has event1; then s1 has event2; after s1 no further events.
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false because at s0 event2 does not occur.
- C2 (C1 and event1) is false (C1 is false).
- C3 and C4 (both ""C2 always holds"") are false.
- C5 (C4 or event2) is false at s0 (C4 false, event2 false there) and true at s1 (event2 true).
- C6 (""if C3 then C5"") is true at every state because its antecedent C3 is false (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true at s0 because C6 is true at s1.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true.

From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen (at some future point). That makes C1 (""event2 does not happen"") false.

C8 is ""If C1 holds, then C7 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Since C1 is false, C8 is true. Therefore C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true or false, given the event rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Reasoning step by step:

1. From the context, event1 occurs initially and then event2 must occur afterward. Therefore event2 does occur in the run.
2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (because event2 does happen).
3. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false right now and event2 happens next, C2 is also false in the next state, so C3 is false.
5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and remains false (no future state makes C2 true), so C4 is false.
6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.
7. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Because C5 is false, C6 is true.
8. C7: ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds."" Event1 does happen, and C6 is true, so the implication C7 is true.
9. C8: ""If C1 holds, then C7 holds."" C1 is false, so the implication with a false antecedent is true; thus C8 is true.
10. C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is true, C9 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:

- From the context: initially event1 has happened, and whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen sometime afterwards; after event2 no further events occur. So event2 does happen eventually on the actual timeline.

- C1 and C2 claim “event2 does not happen.” Those are false (event2 does happen).

- C3 = “C2 holds in the next state.” Since C2 is false at all states, C3 is false.

- C4 = “C3 eventually holds.” C3 is always false, so C4 is false.

- C5 = “C4 holds in the next state.” C4 is false, so C5 is false.

- C6 = “C5 does not hold.” Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

- C7 = “If event1 happens, then C6 holds.” Event1 does happen, and C6 is true, so C7 is true.

- C8 = “If C1 holds, then C7 holds.” C1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C8 is true.

- C9 = “C8 does not hold.” Since C8 is true, C9 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So there is no future state in which any event occurs.
- C1 (event1 does not happen) is true (event1 never occurs).
- C2 (if C1 then event2 happens) is true in the initial state because event2 did happen and C1 holds.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is false: either there is no next state with events, or in a next (empty) state the antecedent C1 still holds but event2 does not happen there, so C2 would be false in that next state.
- C4 is the same as C1, so true. C5 is the same as C2, so true. Hence C6 (C4 or C5) is true, and C7 (not C6) is false.
- C8 is ""if C3 then C7"". Since C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C8 is True.

You ask whether C8 (""If C3 holds, then C7 holds"") is true or false.

Step-by-step:
- The context says initially event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal — there is no next state.
- C3 asserts ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because there is no next state, C3 is false.
- An implication ""If C3 then C7"" with a false antecedent is vacuously true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened. The background rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means the run terminates at that point — there is no next state after the initial state.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because there is no next state, the statement C3 is false (the ""next"" operator is false at a terminal state).
- C8 is the implication C3 -> C7. An implication with a false antecedent is true.
- Therefore C8 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, the future is eventless).

From the context: event1 already happened initially, and because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later time.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A) and is true at every time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds at every time, C2 is true.
- C3 and C4 are the same as C1 and C2 respectively, so C3 and C4 are true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" True (both true).
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" True (both disjuncts true).
- C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens."" Both C6 holds and event1 holds (event1 happened initially), so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is true, C8 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p). It holds at all times.

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds always, it certainly holds eventually. So C2 is true.

3. C3 is identical to C1, so C3 is true. C4 is identical to C2, so C4 is true.

4. C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.

5. C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" At least one (in fact both) is true, so C6 is true.

6. C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens."" Since C6 is true, the disjunction is true, so C7 holds regardless of event1.

7. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" But C7 does hold, so C8 is false.

The contextual facts about event1 and event2 do not change these logical truths. Therefore C8 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- From the context: initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore no event can occur after the initial event1, and event2 does not occur at any time in this execution. (There is no prior event2 because event1 is initial.)

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p -> p), so C1 holds.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds at all times, it certainly eventually holds. So C2 holds.

- C3 and C4 are the same as C1 and C2, so they hold. Thus C5 (C3 and C4) holds.

- C6: ""C2 or C5"" — at least one holds, so C6 holds.

- C7: ""C6 or event1 happens."" C6 holds (and event1 also happened initially), so C7 holds.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 does hold, C8 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- From the context: event1 occurs, then event2 must occur, then event1 must occur, etc. So event1 and event2 alternate; event1 does happen (at least initially).
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" — true (redundant).
- C2 = C1 and event2 — may be true at times when event2 occurs, but it is not true at all times.
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" — false, since C2 does not hold at every moment.
- C4 = ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" — true (the antecedent C3 is false, so the implication is vacuously true).
- C5 = same as C1 — true.
- C6 = C4 or C5 — true (both disjuncts true).
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" — false.
- C8 = ""C7 always holds"" — false.
- C9 = ""C8 always holds"" — false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So events alternate forever: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (they occur repeatedly but not simultaneously or at every instant).

Step 2 — evaluate the claims
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" True (event1 does happen initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" True at times when event2 occurs (C1 is true because event1 happened earlier, and event2 does occur after event1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" False. C2 asserts that event2 happens; event2 does not hold at every moment in time (it occurs only at its occurrence times), so C2 is not true at all times.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is true (an implication with a false antecedent C3 is true).
- C5: same as C1, so True.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" True (both sides are true, so the disjunction is true).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False (since C6 does hold).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" False (C7 is false, so it cannot always hold).
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" False (C8 is false, so it cannot always hold).

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- We must decide whether C9 (""C8 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Context: event1 happens initially. So ""event1 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — true (redundant conjunction).
- C5: same as C1 — true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — true, because C5 holds.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — false, because C6 does hold.
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" — false, since C7 is false.
- C9: ""C8 always holds"" — false, since C8 is false.

Goal: determine whether C8 (""C6 holds and C7 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event2 would require event1 to occur afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From the context: because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 can never occur at any time.

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False — C2 is false and cannot become true later because event2 cannot occur.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (since C3 is false).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" False (C1 is false, C4 true, but conjunction is false).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (since C5 is false).
- C7: ""C2 eventually holds."" False (same reasoning as C3).
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" False (C6 true but C7 false, so conjunction is false).

Final answer: False

Goal: determine whether C8 is True or False.

Interpretation of the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event2 would be followed by event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it has occurred, no further events can occur).

From ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""after event1, no other events can happen"" it follows that no events can occur after the initial point. In particular, event2 cannot occur at any time (there is no time before the initial point, and nothing can happen after it).

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False — event2 never happens.
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That would mean at some future point C2 becomes true (i.e., from that point on event2 always happens). Impossible because event2 never happens, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (since C3 is False).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" False (C1 is False, C4 is True, conjunction is False).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (since C5 is False).
- C7: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3 — False.
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" C6 is True but C7 is False, so the conjunction is False.

Conclusion: C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once the initial event1 has occurred, the system is terminal and no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore event2 never happens at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is never true, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is False, C4 is True.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" C1 is False and C4 is True, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is False, C6 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 (event2 ⇒ event1) is true (vacuously, since event2 never occurs).
- C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens) is true in s0 because C1 holds and event1 happened in s0.
- C3 and C5 require C2 to hold in the next state. In the next state(s), event1 does not happen, so C2 is false there; therefore C3 and C5 are false.
- C4 (eventually C3) is false because C3 never becomes true in any future state (no events occur after s0).
- Thus C6 (C4 and C5) is false.
- C7 states that C6 does not hold; since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Answer being asked: is C7 (""C6 does not hold"") true?

Step-by-step:
1. From the context, event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 never occurs (neither initially nor later).
2. C1 (""if event2 happens then event1 happens"") is true (vacuously true because event2 never happens).
3. C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true in the initial state (C1 holds and event1 happened initially).
4. C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false: in the next state event1 does not happen (event1 only happened initially), so C2 is not true there (even though C1 still holds).
5. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 never becomes true in any future state.
6. C5 (same as C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
7. C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is false (both conjuncts are false).

Step 1 — interpret the background
- Initially: event1 holds in the initial state s0.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" mean: whenever event1 holds in some state, event2 must hold in the next state, and whenever event2 holds, event1 must hold in the next state. So the states alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

Step 2 — understand each condition (informal translation)
- C1 = event1 ∧ event1, so C1 holds exactly in states where event1 holds.
- C2 = same as C1.
- C3 = C1 ∧ C2, so C3 holds exactly in states where event1 holds.
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" = globally C3 (G C3). This requires C3 in every state.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X C4.
- C6 = X C5 = X X C4.
- C7 = G C6.
- C8 = F C7 (eventually C7).
- C9 = G C8 (always C8).

Step 3 — evaluate against the alternating trace
- C3 (and thus C1, C2) is true in s0, s2, s4, ... and false in s1, s3, ...
- Therefore C4 = G C3 is false (C3 does not hold in every state).
- If C4 is false in every state, then X C4 (C5) is false in every state, X X C4 (C6) is false in every state, and hence G C6 (C7) is false.
- Since C7 is false at every state, F C7 (C8) is false (there is no future state where C7 becomes true).
- Finally, G C8 (C9) is false.

Final answer:
False

False

Step‑by‑step reasoning

1. Simplify the Cs:
- C1 = (event1) and (event1) ≡ event1.
- C2 ≡ event1.
- C3 = C1 and C2 ≡ event1.
- C4 = ""always C3"" ≡ always(event1) (i.e. event1 holds at every state).

2. Use the context:
- Initially event1 is true (so event1 holds at time 0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).

From these you can have, for example, an infinite alternating trace:
t0: event1
t1: event2
t2: event1
t3: event2
... 

3. Evaluate the remaining conditions on that trace:
- C4 = always(event1) is false (event1 is false at t1, t3, ...).
- C5 = next(C4) is false at t0 (because C4 is false at t1).
- C6 = next(C5) is false, C7 = always(C6) is false.
- C8 = eventually(C7) is false (C7 never becomes true in this trace).
- C9 = always(C8) is therefore false.

Since a model consistent with the context makes C9 false, C9 is not entailed. Final answer: False."

Sample responses:
You are asked whether C8 is true or false.

Given the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Evaluate the Ci step by step:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False — the next state after the initial event2 must be event1, not event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" True — event1 does happen, so the disjunction is true.
- C3: same as C2, so True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" True — at least one (in fact both) hold.
- C5: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Same as C1, so False.
- C6: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Same, False.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" True — a material implication with a false antecedent (C5 is false) is true.
- C8: ""C4 holds and C7 holds."" True AND True → True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially (state S0) event2 happened.
- The context says: after event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state S1, event1 occurs).
- After event1 no other events can happen (so S1 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, the next state S1 has event1, not event2. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" event1 does happen in the next state, so C2 is True.
- C3: same as C2, so True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" At least one holds, so C4 is True.
- C5: same as C1, so False.
- C6: same as C1, so False.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is True, so C7 is True.
- C8: ""C4 holds and C7 holds."" Both C4 and C7 are True, so C8 is True.

Final answer:
True

The hypothesis asks whether C8 (C4 holds and C7 holds) is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state event1 occurs). After event1, no other events can happen (so event2 does not occur in that next state).
- Evaluate conditions for the next state:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" — False (event1 happens next, and no other events can).
  - C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" — True (event1 happens).
  - C3: same as C2 — True.
  - C4: ""C2 or C3"" — True (both are true).
  - C5: same as C1 — False.
  - C6: same as C1 — False.
  - C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" — True (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- Therefore C4 is true and C7 is true, so C8 (""C4 holds and C7 holds"") is true.

Step 1 — timeline from the context
- State S0 (initial): event1 has happened.
- State S1 (immediately after S0): event2 happens.
- States S2, S3, ...: after event2, no other events ever happen.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True at S0 because event1 has already occurred at S0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether, starting from S1, event1 eventually happens. From S1 onward no event1 occurs (S1 has event2, and after that no events), so C1 is false at S1. Therefore C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is already false at S1 and will remain false in all future states (no possibility for event1 to occur later), so C2 never becomes true. Thus C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is false at S1 and stays false, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false already, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Same reasoning, C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 never becomes true, so C7 is False.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 is false and never becomes true, so C8 is False.
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" C8 is false, so C9 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- At the initial state s0, event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen at some later state sN (N > 0).
- After event2 occurs, no further events ever occur.

Step 2 — clarify temporal meanings
- ""Eventually"" means: there exists some future state (including the current one) where the event holds.
- ""Next"" means: the very next state.

Step 3 — evaluate the chain
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True at s0 because event1 already happened at s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At s1 (the next state), does C1 hold? C1 would require event1 to occur at or after s1. But event1 occurred only at s0 and, by the scenario, does not occur again. So C1 is false at s1, hence C2 is false at s0.
- Because C2 is false at every state (there is no later state where event1 will again eventually occur), any formula that asserts C2 will eventually or always hold is also false:
  - C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
  - C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.
  - C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.
  - C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.
  - C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false.
  - C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is false.
  - C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is therefore false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True — event1 already happened in the initial state.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. from the next state, event1 will eventually happen. After event1, event2 must happen next, and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur again in the future. Therefore C1 is not true from the next state, so C2 is False.

- Once C2 is false in the next state and can never become true later (because no further events after event2), every condition that depends on C2 holding now or eventually fails:
  - C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is False.
  - C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is False.
  - C5 (""C4 always holds"") is False.
  - C6 (""C5 always holds"") is False.
  - C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is False.
  - C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is False.
  - C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is therefore False.

So C9 is False."

Final answer:

Step 1 — translate the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happened"" is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (which it has), event2 cannot happen at any later time.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur given the previous points.)

Step 2 — evaluate the C-conditions given those facts
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- Event2 cannot happen (because event1 already happened and blocks any later events), so ""event2 happens"" is false.
- C3 and C4 require event2 to happen, so both C3 and C4 are false.
- C5 (""if event2 happens then C4"") is vacuously true because event2 is false.
- C6 (""if C3 then C5"") is vacuously true because C3 is false.
- C7 (""if event2 happens then C6"") is vacuously true because event2 is false.
- C8 = C1 and C7. Since C1 is false, C8 is false regardless of C7.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Interpretation: ""always"" = globally (G), ""eventually"" = at some time in the future (F). The trace starts with event2 true at t0 and for all t>0 no events occur.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (G event2). This is false because event2 is true at t0 but not at later times, so G event2 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1). Since C1 is already false at t0, C2 is false.

4. C3 and C4: ""C2 does not hold"" (¬C2). Because C2 is false, ¬C2 is true. So C3 is true (and C4 is the same, so true as well).

5. C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — true because at least one (in fact both) of C3,C4 are true.

6. C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" (F C5). C5 is true now (at t0), so F C5 is true.

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" (F C6). C6 is true now, so F C6 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context forces an infinite alternation: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ...
- C1 (""event1 and event1"") is true at states where event1 happens (so true at t0, t2, ...).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") would require event1 at every state. That fails because at t1 (and every odd step) event2 happens, so C2 is false at t0.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false at t0 because C2 is already false at t1.
- C4 (""if event2 happens then C3 holds"") is true at t0 vacuously (event2 does not happen at t0), but at t1 it is false: event2 does happen at t1 yet C3 at t1 is false.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false at t0, and so C6 (""C5 and event1"") is false at t0.
- That makes C7, C8 false at t0 and in fact they cannot become true later: C8 (""C7 always holds"") would require C6 to hold at every later state shifted by one, but C6 requires event1 and event1 does not hold at every state (it alternates), so C6 cannot hold at all future states from some point onward.
- Hence C8 never becomes true at any state, so C9 (""eventually C8 holds"") is false.

Thus C9 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpretations:
- ""Initially, event1 happened"" means at state s0: event1 is true.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" give an alternating infinite trace:
  s0: event1
  s1: event2
  s2: event1
  s3: event2
  ... and so on.
- ""next"" means the immediate successor state; ""always"" means true at every state.

2. Simplify C1:
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" ≡ event1.
  So C1 is true exactly at s0, s2, s4, ... and false at s1, s3, ...

3. C2 = ""C1 always holds"":
- That requires event1 to hold at every state. But event1 is false at s1, s3, ... because of the alternation. So C2 is false.

4. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"":
- Since C2 is false at every state, C3 is false at every state (the next-state requirement cannot be satisfied).

5. C4 = ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"":
- At states where event2 happens (s1, s3, ...), the antecedent is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false at those states. Thus C4 does not hold in general.

6. C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"":
- Because C4 is false at many states, C5 is false at those predecessor states; overall C5 is false in the model.

7. C6 = ""C5 holds and event1 happens"":
- Since C5 is false, C6 is false everywhere (even where event1 holds).

8. C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"":
- With C6 false everywhere, C7 is false everywhere.

9. C8 = ""C7 always holds"":
- C7 is false, so C8 is false.

10. C9 = ""C8 eventually holds"":
- C8 never holds at any state, so ""eventually C8"" is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Goal: determine whether C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the C1..C9 definitions.

Interpretation/assumptions:
- Time is discrete states t0, t1, t2, ...
- ""Initially, event1 happened"" means event1 is true at t0.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" are interpreted as next-state obligations: whenever event1 holds at some state, event2 holds at the next state, and whenever event2 holds at some state, event1 holds at the next state. That gives an alternating sequence: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ...

Evaluate the Cs at t0 (and where needed at future states):

1. C1: ""event1 and event1"" — true at t0 (same as event1).
2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (globally): false, because at t1 event1 is false (t1 has event2), so C1 does not hold at every state.
3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2): false at t0, because C2 is false at t1.
4. C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" (event2 → C3): at t0 event2 is false, so C4 is vacuously true at t0. But we must also consider it at other states.
   - At t1 (where event2 is true), C3 at t1 would require C2 at t2; C2 is false at t2, so C3 is false at t1, hence C4 is false at t1.
5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4): false at t0 because C4 is false at t1.
6. C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens"": false at t0 (C5 is false; even though event1 is true).
7. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6): false at t0 because C6 is false at t1.
8. C8: ""C7 always holds"" (globally): false, since C7 is already false at t0 (and at other states).
9. C9: ""C8 eventually holds"" (F C8): this asks if there exists some future state where C8 is true. But C8 requires C7 to hold at every future state from some point on; C7 is already false and its falsity propagates (due to the failed C2/C3/C4/C5 chain), so there is no future state where C8 becomes true.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context we have a single possible trace of events:
   - State 0 (initial): event1 happened.
   - State 1: because event1 happened, event2 must happen.
   - State 2 (and onward): after event2 no other events can happen (so event1 will not occur again).

2. Interpret the temporal formulas in the usual linear temporal sense (F = eventually, G = always, X = next):
   - C1: F(event1). At state 0 this is true because event1 holds at state 0.
   - C2: F(event1). Same as C1, true at state 0.
   - C3: G(C2). This requires C2 to be true at every state. But at state 1 (and later) event1 does not occur in the future, so C2 is false there. Hence C3 is false.
   - C4: X(C3). This asks whether C3 holds at the next state (state 1). C3 is false at state 1, so C4 is false.
   - C5: G(C2). Same as C3, false.
   - C6: C4 or C5. Both are false, so C6 is false.
   - C7: C1 or C6. At state 0, C1 is true, so C7 is true at state 0. But C7 must hold at every state for C8 to be true.
   - At state 1, C1 (F(event1)) is false (event1 will not occur again) and C6 is false, so C7 is false at state 1.

3. C8: G(C7). Because C7 is false at state 1, C8 does not hold.

Therefore C8 is False.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context: s0 = initial state where event1 happened; s1 = after s0 where event2 happens; s2 = after s1 where no further events occur. There are no further occurrences of event1 after s0.

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" At s0 this is true (it already happened). So C1 is true at s0.
- C2: same as C1, true at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" i.e. at every state F(event1) must hold. At s1, event1 does not occur at s1 or any future state, so F(event1) is false at s1. Thus C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: duplicate of C3, false.
- C6: ""C4 or C5"" is false (both false).
- C7: ""C1 or C6"" reduces to F(event1). That is true at s0 but false at s1 and later (event1 does not occur in the future of s1).
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" requires C7 to be true at every state. Since C7 is false at s1 (and subsequent states), C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- From the context: event2 initially, and after event2 event1 must happen, and after event1 event2 must happen. So events alternate forever; at every time at least one of event1 or event2 holds.
- Therefore C1, C2, C3 (""Event1 happens or event2 happens"") are true at all times.
- C4 (""Event2 happens or C3"") is true because C3 is true.
- C5 (C2 and C4) is true (true and true).
- C6 (If C1 then C5) therefore holds whenever C1 holds; since C1 always holds, C6 holds at all times.
- C7 asserts ""C6 always holds"" — this is true.
- C8 asserts ""C7 does not hold"" — this is false at all times (contradicted by C7).
- C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is false because C8 never holds.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:

- C7 asserts that C6 always holds (i.e. at every time point C6 is true).
- Therefore C7 is true and C6 is true at every time.
- C8 is the statement “C7 does not hold.” That contradicts C7, so C8 is false at every time.
- C9 says “C8 eventually holds” (i.e. at some future time C8 becomes true). Since C8 is never true, C9 is false.

(The background rules about event1/event2 do not change this contradiction: C7 already forces C6 to hold always, so C8 cannot ever become true.)
---
Step 1 — simplify the Cs:
- C1, C2, C3 are all ""event1 ∨ event2"".
- C4 = ""event2 ∨ C3"" = ""event2 ∨ (event1 ∨ event2)"" = ""event1 ∨ event2"".
- C5 = C2 ∧ C4 = (event1 ∨ event2) ∧ (event1 ∨ event2) = event1 ∨ event2.

So C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are all equivalent to the same proposition P := (event1 ∨ event2).

Step 2 — analyze C6–C9:
- C6 is ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds"", i.e. P → P, which is a tautology (always true at any time).
- C7 says ""C6 always holds"" — since C6 is true at every time, C7 is true.
- C8 says ""C7 does not hold"" — this is the negation of a true statement, so C8 is false (and false at all times).
- C9 says ""C8 eventually holds"" — since C8 never holds, C9 is false.

The context about events (initial event2 and mutual eventual obligations) does not change these logical equivalences and does not make C8 ever true.

True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. C6 says ""C5 always holds"" and C7 says ""C6 always holds"". Taken together, C7 is true (it asserts C6 always holds) and that makes C6 true as well.
2. C6 being true means C5 holds. C5 is ""C1 holds and C4 holds"", so C1 and C4 are both true.
3. With C1 true, C2 (the same statement as C1) is also true. Hence C3 = (C2 or event1) is true.
4. C4 is ""if C3 holds then event1 happens""; since C3 is true, event1 must hold (and that is consistent with C1).
5. C8 is ""C7 does not hold"". But C7 does hold (from step 1), so C8 is false.
6. C9 is ""C8 does not hold"" = not C8. Since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).

From the context we therefore have that event1 does happen (in the given execution/setting).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the setup (event2 occurred and forces event1), treat this as true.
- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" Same as C1, so true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 is true and event1 does happen, so the implication is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is true (and there is no counterexample in the given setting), so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Same reasoning, C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" C7 is true, so C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is false, ""C8 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context as a timeline of states
- Let S0 be the initial state: event1 happened at S0.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens at S1.
- After event2, no other events can happen → from S2 onward there are no events.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e. at all states from the current one onward)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 or C2, so equivalent to C1 (since C1 and C2 are identical).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (i.e. C3 true at S1).
- C5: same as C4 (C3 true at S1).
- C6: C4 and C5, so equivalent to C4 (both identical).

Step 3 — evaluate truth values on the timeline
- C1/C2: false. Although event1 occurs at S0, it does not occur at S1 (event2 occurs) nor afterward, so ""event1 always happens"" is false.
- C3 (C1 or C2): false.
- C4/C5: false, because at S1 C3 is false.
- C6 (C4 and C5): false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what’s being asked:
- The hypothesis asks whether C6 (which is C4 and C5) is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition in context:
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 no other events can happen.
- C1 and C2: “Event1 always happens.” That is false: event1 happens initially but not in all later states (after event1 we must have event2, and after event2 nothing else happens), so event1 does not always hold.
- C3: “C1 holds or C2 holds.” Since C1 and C2 are both false, C3 is false.
- C4 and C5: “C3 holds in the next state.” C3 is false (and remains false), so C4 and C5 are false.
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds.” Conjunction of two false statements is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C6 is true or false given the context (initial event1, then event2, then nothing).

Step 2 — interpret the statements and the timeline
- Interpret “always” as “at every state (globally)”.
- Timeline forced by the context:
  - State 0 (initial): event1 happens.
  - State 1: event2 happens (must happen after event1).
  - State 2: no events can happen (after event2 nothing else can occur).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” False — event1 occurs at state0 but not at state1 (state1 has event2), so it is not true at every state.
- C2: same as C1, so also False.
- C3: “C1 holds or C2 holds.” Since both C1 and C2 are False, C3 is False.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” At the next state (state1) C3 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: same as C4, so False.
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds.” That is False ∧ False, so False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C8 (C7 holds and event1 happens) is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 does occur (after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → the events alternate, but we only need that event1 does occur at least once.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication and thus holds.
- C3 is identical to C1, so C3 also holds.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds and event2 did indeed happen (initially), C2 is true.
- C4 is identical to C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 holds and C4 holds, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" At least one (in fact both) hold, so C6 holds.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds now, so ""eventually holds"" is satisfied; C7 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C8
- C7 holds (just shown).
- event1 happens (from the context: after the initial event2, event1 must happen).
- Therefore C8 (C7 holds and event1 happens) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Brief justification (concise, not internal chain-of-thought):
- C1 and C3 are tautologies (event1 → event1), so they hold.
- C2 is given: since C1 holds, C2 implies event2 holds.
- C6 = (C2 or C5); because C2 holds, C6 holds.
- C7 = ""C6 eventually holds""; since C6 already holds, C7 holds.
- From the context: event2 initially happened and after event2 event1 must happen, so event1 does happen.
- Therefore C8 (C7 holds AND event1 happens) is true.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
You ask whether C8 (""C7 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C7.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 holds.
- C3: identical to C1, so C3 holds.
- C2 and C4: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds, these require event2 to happen. The context states event2 happened initially, so event2 indeed happens; therefore C2 and C4 hold.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 holds and C4 holds, so C5 holds.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" At least one holds (in fact both), so C6 holds.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 already holds, it certainly holds eventually, so C7 holds.
- ""event1 happens"": The context says that after event2 (which happened initially), event1 must happen, so event1 does happen (at least once).

Step 3 — evaluate C8
C8 is ""C7 holds and event1 happens."" Both conjuncts are true, so C8 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - State 0 (initial): event2 happened.
   - Because “after event2, event1 must happen,” State 1: event1 happens.
   - Because “after event1, no other events can happen,” no further eventful states follow.

2. Evaluate at State 1 (since C8 asserts “C7 holds in the next state” relative to the initial state):
   - C3: “event1 and event2” — false in State 1 (event2 happened only in State 0).
   - C4: “if C1 then event1” — true in State 1 (C1 is false there, so the implication is vacuously true).
   - C5 = C3 or C4 — true (because C4 is true).
   - C6 = not C5 — false.
   - C2: “if C1 then event1” — true in State 1 (same reasoning as C4).
   - C7 = C2 and C6 — true and false = false.

3. C8 says “C7 holds in the next state” (i.e., C7 true in State 1). We found C7 is false in State 1.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: event2 happens initially and event1 must happen after event2, so both event2 and event1 do occur. Therefore C1 (""event1 happens and event2 happens"") is true. C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.

- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" That is a logical tautology (C1 implies event1), so C2 is true. C4 is the same as C2, so C4 is true.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context states: event1 happens initially, and thereafter event1 and event2 must alternate (after event1 comes event2, after event2 comes event1). So event1 does occur (indeed at the start and repeatedly).

2. C1 is ""Event1 does not happen."" That contradicts the context, so C1 is false.

3. C2 and C5 are the same as C1, so they are also false.

4. C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" Whether C3 is true or false is irrelevant to the final question, because C4 = C1 and C3. Since C1 is false, C4 is false.

5. C6 is ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are false, so C6 is false.

6. C7 is ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false. Then C8 and C9 (which assert that the previous always-holds facts hold) are also false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Goal: determine whether C9 is True or False.

Context summary
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Hence event1 happens initially and then the system forces an infinite alternation of event1 and event2; in particular event1 does happen (now and repeatedly).

Evaluate the conditions step by step
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 happens initially), so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false now and, given the required alternation, event1 continues to occur, there is no time at which the proposition ""event1 does not happen"" becomes true forever; thus C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: again ""Event1 does not happen."" False.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is false (now), C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is false, so C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" C8 is false, so C9 is false.

Conclusion
C9 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
1. The context states event1 happened initially and then events 1 and 2 must alternate, so event1 does occur (in fact infinitely often).
2. C1, C2 and C5 all assert ""Event1 does not happen."" That contradicts the context, so those claims are false.
3. C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false and event1 continues to occur, C2 will never become true, so C3 is false.
4. C4 = C1 ∧ C3 is false (both conjuncts false). C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is false (both disjuncts false).
5. C7 says ""C6 always holds"" — false because C6 is already false. Then C8 and C9, which state that C7 always holds (and iterated), are also false.
6. Therefore C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

1. From the context: event2 happens initially, and then event1 must occur afterwards. So in the run there is an occurrence of event1 (and after event1 nothing else happens). Therefore the atomic statement ""event1 happens"" is true in this run.

2. C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a conjunction of the same true atomic fact twice, so C1 is true.

3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true (event1 does occur), C2 is true.

4. C3 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2, so C3 is true.

5. C4 = ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C3 is true and event1 happens), so C4 is true.

6. C5 = same as C1, so C5 is true.

7. C6 = ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.

8. C7 = ""C2 holds and C6 holds."" Both are true, so C7 is true.

9. C8 = ""C7 holds and event1 happens."" C7 is true and event1 happens, so C8 is true.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: event2 happens initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen. So the actual sequence is: event2, then event1, then nothing else. Thus event1 does occur at some point.

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is true because event1 occurs (the duplicate conjunct is redundant).

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since event1 occurs later, C1 holds at that time, so C2 is true.

- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C3 is true and event1 happens), so C4 is true.

- C5: same as C1, so C5 is true.

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both true, so C6 is true.

- C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds."" Both true, so C7 is true.

- C8: ""C7 holds and event1 happens."" C7 is true and event1 does happen, so C8 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some future point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Thus there is an execution in which event1 does occur (exactly once after the initial event2).

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — equivalent to ""event1 eventually happens"".
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — true if event1 eventually happens (C3) or if event1 is happening now.
- C5: same as C1, i.e. ""event1 happens"".
- C6: C4 and C5 — requires event1 to be happening now (C5) and C4 to hold (which is true whenever event1 will happen or is happening).
- C7: C2 and C6 — requires event1 eventually happens (C2) and C6 (which already requires event1 happening now).
- C8: C7 and event1 happens — requires event1 happening now and the other conjunctions.

Step 3 — evaluate given the context
- Because the context forces event1 to occur after event2, there is a moment when event1 happens.
- At that moment:
  - C1 (event1) is true.
  - C2 and C3 (""event1 eventually"") are true (they hold already before and at that moment).
  - C4 is true (C3 holds or event1 happens).
  - C5 is true (event1 happens).
  - C6 = C4 and C5 is true at that moment.
  - C7 = C2 and C6 is true at that moment.
  - C8 = C7 and event1 happens is true at that moment.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions using the context
- Context: event2 happened initially (so ""event2 happens"" is true).
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" → equivalent to ""event2 happens"" → True.
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" → C1 is True, so C2 is True.
- C3 and C4 are the same as C2, so C3 = True and C4 = True.
- C5 = ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 and C4 are both True, C5 is True.
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold."" But C5 holds, so C6 is False.
- C7 = ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" C2 holds (True) but C6 is False, so the implication is False.

1) What is being asked: determine whether C7 (""If C2 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

2) Use the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 happened (true).

3) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"", so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — same, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" — antecedent C3 is true and consequent C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — but C5 does hold, so C6 is false.

4) Now C7: ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" C2 is true while C6 is false, so the implication C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We want to determine whether C7 (""If C2 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

1) From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened ⇒ event2 is true.
   - After event2 no other events can happen ⇒ event1 cannot happen (event1 is false).

2) Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 or event2"" = event2, so C1 is true (because event2 happened).
   - C2: ""C1 or event1"" = true or false = true.
   - C3: same as C2 = true.
   - C4: same as C2 = true.
   - C5: ""If C3 then C4"" = true → true = true.
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold"" = not true = false.

3) Finally C7: ""If C2 then C6"" = true → false = false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can occur. So event1 does happen (initially) and event2 cannot occur later.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" C2 is false, so the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C4: same as C1, so false.
- C5: same form as C3, so true (vacuously).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" C4 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" C3 is true while C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C3 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context and contradictions
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 occurs at the start and prevents any later events.)
- C1 / C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 did happen), so C1 and C4 are false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (initially event1 happened), C2 is false.
  
Step 3 — evaluate C3, C5, C6, C7
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Because C2 is false, the implication C3 is vacuously true.
- C5 is the same as C3, so C5 is also true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" C4 is false, C5 is true, so C6 is false (conjunction false).
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds."" C3 is true, but C6 is false, so the implication C7 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The question asks whether C9 is true given the context and the chain C1..C9.

2. Expand the relevant conditions:
   - C3: (event1) -> C2.
   - C4: C3 ∨ event1.
   - C5: ¬C4, i.e. ¬C3 ∧ ¬event1.
   - C6: C1 ∧ C5.
   - C7: Eventually C6 holds.
   - C8: C7 ∧ event2.
   - C9: C8 holds in the next state.

3. Observe a logical contradiction in C5:
   - ¬C3 means C3 is false. An implication (event1 → C2) is false exactly when event1 is true and C2 is false; so ¬C3 implies event1 is true (and C2 false).
   - But C5 also requires ¬event1.
   - So C5 requires both event1 and ¬event1 in the same state — impossible. Therefore C5 is unsatisfiable (false in every state).

4. Propagate that impossibility:
   - Since C5 is always false, C6 = C1 ∧ C5 is always false.
   - Hence C7 (""eventually C6"") cannot be true.
   - Thus C8 = C7 ∧ event2 is false, and C9 (C8 in the next state) is false.

Therefore C9 is False.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Model reading:
   - Initially event2 has happened.
   - After event2 no other events can happen → there is no next state after the initial state (the run is terminal).
   - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2 (and there's no earlier history in this model).

2. Evaluate the Ci in the initial (and only) state:
   - C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — false (event1 never happens).
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — true (implication is vacuously true because C1 is false).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — true (C2 holds now, so it holds eventually).
   - C4: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — same as C1, so false.
   - C5: ""C3 or C4"" — true (C3 is true).
   - C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — true (C5 holds now).
   - C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — false (there is no next state, so X(C6) is false).
   - C8: ""C7 eventually holds"" — false (C7 is false and there are no future states to make it true).
   - C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — true (C8 is false).

Therefore C9 is True.
---

---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 has already happened and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 can never occur at any state. Therefore ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1 and C4) is false.
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event1 happens"". Since C1 is false, C2 is true (implication with false antecedent).
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". C2 already holds now, so C3 is true.
- C5 is ""C3 or C4"". C3 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6 is ""C5 eventually holds"". C5 already holds, so C6 is true.
- C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state"". Because the same reasoning applies in every state (C2–C6 remain true), C6 holds in the next state, so C7 is true.
- C8 is ""C7 eventually holds"". C7 already holds, so C8 is true.
- C9 is ""C8 does not hold"" (i.e., not C8). Because C8 is true, C9 is false.

Thus C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C9 is True or False. We'll evaluate each Ci step by step using the given facts and standard truth of implications (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → from the initial event1, event2 will happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen → produces alternation, but we only need the fact that both events do occur.

Stepwise evaluation:
1. C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True — event1 happened initially and event2 must happen after it.
2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" False — nothing in the context makes C1 true at all times; we only know both events occur, not that the conjunction is an invariant.
3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C2 is false, so C3 is vacuously true.
4. C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is true and event2 happens, so C4 is true.
5. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false.
6. C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
7. C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" Antecedent C6 is false, so C7 is vacuously true.
8. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" C7 is true, so C8 is false.
9. C9: ""C8 always holds."" C8 is false, so C9 is false.

Final answer:
False
---

---
Step 1 — what the context implies
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does happen (after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens again, and this alternation continues.
So both event1 and event2 do occur (indeed repeatedly).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (both occur).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False — C1 asserts both events hold at the same time; they occur alternately, so C1 is not true at every moment.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" True — the antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" True (C3 is true and event2 does happen).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (C4 does hold).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" False (C5 is false, so it cannot always hold).
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" True (antecedent C6 is false, so implication is true).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" False (C7 is true).
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" False (C8 is false, so it cannot always hold).

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened, and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" makes that state terminal — there is no next state with any events.
- C1 and C4/C8 require event2 to happen; there is no event2 anywhere, so those are false.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- C5 (""If C3 holds then C4 holds"") is true vacuously (false antecedent).
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is therefore false.
- C7 (""Event1 happens and C6 holds"") is false (C6 false).
- C9 (""C7 holds and C8 holds"") combines two false conjuncts, so C9 is false.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C9 (""C7 holds and C8 holds"") can be true under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 would be followed by event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it has happened, no further events can occur).

Step 3 — consequences for event2
- Since event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time (there is no earlier time before the initial state to place event2).
- Therefore any claim that ""event2 happens"" is false in this context.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C8 asserts ""event2 happens"" (twice redundantly). So C8 is false.
- C4 and C1 also assert event2 happens; they are false.
- C2 and C3 depend on C1 (event2) and so cannot be true (C3 is false).
- C5 is ""if C3 holds then C4 holds"". Since C3 is false, the implication C5 is vacuously true.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold"" — but C5 does hold, so C6 is false.
- C7 is ""event1 happens and C6 holds"". Although event1 happens, C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Step 5 — conclusion about C9
- C9 is C7 and C8; both conjuncts are false (at least one is false), so C9 is false.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let S0 be the initial state: event1 holds at S0, event2 does not.
- By the context, states alternate: S0: event1; S1: event2; S2: event1; etc.

Evaluate the Cs at S0 (where we only need to show a counterexample to C8):

- C1: ""event1 and event1"" — true at S0.
- C2: ""if event2 then C1"" — vacuously true at S0 because event2 is false at S0.
- C3 = C1, so true at S0.
- C4 = C2, so true at S0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — false at S0 because at S1 event2 holds but event1 does not, so C4 fails at S1.
- C6: ""if C3 then C5"" — false at S0 (C3 true, C5 false).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — false (already fails at S0).
- C8: ""if C2 then C7"" — false at S0 because C2 is true but C7 is false, so the implication is false.

Thus C8 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true at the initial state.
- C1 and C2 (each ""if event1 happens then event1 happens"") are trivial implications and therefore hold.
- C5 is C1 or C4. Because C1 holds, C5 holds.
- C6 is ""if C5 holds then event1 happens."" Since C5 holds and event1 indeed happened initially, C6 holds in the initial state.
- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 holds right now (in the initial state), C7 is true (the eventuality is satisfied immediately).
- C8 is ""C7 does not hold."" That contradicts the previous line, so C8 is false in the initial state.
- C9 is ""C8 always holds."" Since C8 is already false in the initial state, C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---

---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event1 does occur, and event2 never occurs.
- C1 and C2 are of the form (event1 → event1), which are true.
- C3 is (C2 → event2). Since C2 is true, C3 would require event2 to happen. But event2 never happens, so C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is irrelevant because C1 is already true.
- C5 = (C1 or C4) is true because C1 is true.
- C6 is (C5 → event1). With C5 true and event1 having happened, C6 is true.
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true (C6 already holds now, and ""eventually"" includes the current state).
- C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is therefore false.
- C9 (""C8 always holds"") therefore cannot be true (C8 is false right away).

Sample responses:
We interpret the statements in linear-time terms (states in sequence, X = next, F = eventually). Initially event2 is true, and after either event1 or event2 no further events occur (so no future state will have event1 or event2 true).

Evaluate the Ci one by one at the initial state:

- C1: ""event2 and event2"" is equivalent to ""event2"" — true initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually"" (F C1) — true, because C1 already holds now.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). At the next state, no events occur, so there is no future state (from there) where event2 occurs; hence C1 is false in all futures of the next state, so C2 is false at the next state. Therefore C3 is false at the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3) — since C3 is false at the next state, C4 is false at the initial state.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — true at the initial state (because C4 is false).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). At the next state C4 is still false (no events ever occur there), so C5 is true at the next state; hence C6 is true at the initial state.
- C7: same as C1, so true initially.
- C8: ""C6 or C7"" — true (both are true).
- C9: ""event1 and C8"" — event1 is false (event2 happened initially and thereafter no other events, so event1 never occurs), so C9 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C9 is False.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds now.

- C8 is ""C6 holds or C7 holds""; since C7 is true, C8 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, the only possible execution is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" — true in the run (both events occur).
- C2 / C7: ""C1 holds in the next state."" — false when evaluated at the state after event2, because at that next state event2 no longer happens (it happened earlier), so C1 does not hold there.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" — false, since C2 is not true at that next state.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — true (negation of false).
- C5: same as C1 — true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" — true (both are true).
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" — true because C6 holds.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Let S0 be the initial state: event2 is true in S0.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" in the next state S1 event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means S1 has event1 and not event2 (and no further events later).

Now evaluate the conditions at S0:
- C1 (""event2 and event1"") requires both in the same state. S0 has only event2, so C1 is false at S0.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") asks whether C1 is true in S1. S1 has event1 but not event2, so C1 is false in S1 → C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is therefore false, so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.
- C5 is the same as C1 and is false at S0.
- C6 = C4 and C5 = true and false = false.
- C7 is the same as C2 and is false.
- C8 = C6 or C7 = false or false = False.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step (use two states: S0 = initial, S1 = next):

- By context: in S0 event2 has happened and event1 has not yet. In S1 event1 happens and, after that, no further events occur. So in S0: event2 = True, event1 = False. In S1: event1 = True, event2 = False (we treat ""happens"" as a state property).

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This is false in S0 (event1 not yet) and false in S1 (event2 not present there). So C1 is False.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" From S0 the next state is S1; C1 is False in S1, so C2 is False.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is False (it does not hold in S1), so C3 is False.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is False, C4 is True.

- C5: same as C1, so C5 is False.

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" That is True ∧ False = False.

- C7: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Same as C2, so False.

- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" False ∨ False = False.

Therefore C8 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context gives: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore no events (including event1) can ever happen after that initial moment.
2. C1 matches the context rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" — so C1 is true.
3. C2 = (event2 happens) and C1 holds. event2 did happen initially and C1 holds, so C2 is true.
4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"". Because event2 has happened and no further events can change facts, C2 remains true, so C3 is true. Likewise C4 = ""C3 always holds"" is true.
5. C5 repeats the implication of C1, so C5 is true. Thus C6 = C4 and C5 is true.
6. C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" is false (since C6 does hold). Therefore C8 = ""C7 does not hold"" is true.
7. C9 = C8 holds and event1 happens. C8 is true, but event1 cannot happen (event2 already occurred and forbids any later events). So C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 must occur subsequently).

Because event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time in the timeline.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context and is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 did happen and C1 holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since nothing changes after the initial event2 (no further events), C2 remains true, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Similarly true.
- C5: same as C1, true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" True.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This contradicts C6, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is false, C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 holds and event1 happens."" C8 is true but event1 does not happen (it cannot, because event2 already occurred and no events occur after it). Therefore C9 is false.

False

Sample responses:

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From context: event2 happened initially. After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore no event can occur after the initial moment; in particular event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- C1 and C8 state ""Event1 always happens."" Given event1 cannot occur, C1 and C8 are false.

- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.

- C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") is false (C4 is false).
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true.
- C7 (""If C6 holds, then event2 happens""): antecedent C6 is true and event2 did happen initially, so C7 is true.
- C9 is ""If C7 holds, then C8 holds."" C7 is true but C8 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
The hypothesis is asking whether C9 (""If C7 holds, then C8 holds"") is true given the context.

Reasoning:
- Context: Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 has happened and no event1 can ever occur (there is no time before the initial event2 when event1 could have happened, and no events can occur afterward).
- C1 (event1 always happens): False (event1 never happens).
- C2 (C1 eventually holds): False (C1 never becomes true).
- C3 (C2 does not hold): True (since C2 is false).
- C4 (C3 holds and event1 happens): False (event1 does not happen).
- C5 (C4 holds and event2 happens): False (C4 is false).
- C6 (C5 does not hold): True (since C5 is false).
- C7 (If C6 holds, then event2 happens): True (C6 is true and event2 did happen).
- C8 (event1 always happens): False (same as C1).
- C9 (If C7 holds, then C8 holds): This is an implication with true antecedent (C7) and false consequent (C8), so it is False.

Final answer:
False

Question: is C9 (""If C7 holds, then C8 holds"") true?

Reasoning:
- From the context: event2 happens initially; after event2 no further events can happen; therefore event1 never happens.
- Evaluate each condition:
  - C1: ""Event1 always happens."" — False (event1 never happens).
  - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — False (C1 can never become true).
  - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — True (since C2 is false).
  - C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" — False (event1 does not happen).

We are asked whether C7 is true given the context.

1) From the context: event2 happens initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. So both event2 and event1 happen.

2) Evaluate conditions:

- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: same as C1. True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since C2 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" C1 is true and C4 is true, so the implication C5 is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" True (same as C4).
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Both are true, so C7 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

From this, both event2 and event1 happen (in that order).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: Event2 happens and event1 happens. True.
- C2: Event2 happens and event1 happens. True.
- C3: Event2 happens and event1 happens. True.
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds. Since C2 (and C3) is true, C4 is True.
- C5: If C1 holds, then C4 holds. C1 is true and C4 is true, so the implication C5 is True.
- C6: C2 holds or C3 holds. True (as above).
- C7: C5 holds and C6 holds. Both are true, so C7 is True.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s asked:
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (C5 ∧ C6) is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Therefore both event2 and event1 happen (and no further events occur).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1, C2, C3: each is “event2 happens and event1 happens.” Given the context, these are true.
- C4: C2 ∨ C3. Since C2 (and C3) is true, C4 is true.
- C5: C1 → C4. C1 is true and C4 is true, so the implication is true.
- C6: C2 ∨ C3. True (same as C4).
- C7: C5 ∧ C6. Both conjuncts are true, so C7 is true.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context, event2 happened initially. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does occur (at the start) and there are no further events afterwards.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True because event2 has already happened initially.

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is true: event1 never actually happens (because event2 happened and then no further events can occur), so C2 is vacuously true; additionally C1 is already true anyway.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" There are no later states in which C2 could fail, so C2 holds at every state; hence C3 is true.

- C4 is the same as C2, so it is true.

- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.

- C6: ""C5 always holds."" As above, C5 holds at every state, so C6 is true.

- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Same reasoning, C7 is true.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous step; C7 does hold, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- At the initial moment event2 has already happened.
- After event1 happens, no further events can happen.
- After event2 happens, no further events can happen.
So the actual execution: event2 happened initially, and no other events can occur thereafter.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it happened initially).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True. Event1 never actually happens in the run (because event2 already occurred and prevents further events), so the implication is vacuously true; even without relying on vacuity, C1 is true independently.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" True. C2 holds now and remains true at all future times (no events change it).
- C4: same as C2 — True.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" True.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" True.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous: C7 does hold, so C8 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — base facts
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus event2 does happen (indeed it already happened) and no further events (including event1) can occur.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True: C1 is true, so the implication holds (and in fact event1 never happens here, so it's vacuously satisfied).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" True: C2 is true now, and nothing can occur to make it false later, so it holds at all times.
- C4: same as C2, so True.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" True (both are true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True (same reasoning: C5 is true and no future change).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" True (again, no change can make this false).

Step 3 — final
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 does hold, C8 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - State 0 (initial): event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → State 1: event1.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → States 2,3,...: no events.

2. Evaluate the Ci at the initial state (state 0):
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Next state is state 1, where event1 (not event2) occurs → C1 = False.
   - C2: same as C1 → C2 = False.
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" There is no future state k with event2 at k+1 (event2 only at state 0), so C2 never holds → C3 = False.
   - C4: C1 ∧ C3 → False ∧ False = False.
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" → C4 at state1 is False → C5 = False.
   - C6: ""C5 always holds"" → False (since C5 does not hold) → C6 = False.
   - C7: ""C6 does not hold"" → since C6 is False, C7 = True.
   - C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" → at state1, C7 is also true (same reasoning) → C8 = True.
   - C9: ""C8 does not hold"" → C8 is True, so C9 = False.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Timeline from the context:
  - state0 (initial): event2 happens.
  - state1 (next): because after event2 event1 must happen, event1 happens.
  - state2 and later: after event1 no other events can happen (so no event2 ever again).

- Evaluate the Ci at the initial state:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — false (state1 has event1).
  - C2: same as C1 — false.
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — false, because event2 will never occur in any future next state.
  - C4: C1 and C3 — false.
  - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — false (C4 is false at state1).
  - C6: ""C5 always holds"" — false (C5 is false).
  - C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — true (since C6 is false).
  - C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — true (C7 is true at state1 as well).
  - C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — false (C8 is true).

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context and timeline
- Initial state (call it state0): event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → state1: event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from state2 onward no events.

So the timeline of events is:
state0: event2
state1: event1
state2, state3, ...: no events

Step 2 — evaluate each condition at the initial state (state0)

C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Next state is state1, where event1 (not event2) happens. So C1 is false.

C2: same as C1 → false.

C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That asks whether there is some future state where C2 is true. For C2 to be true at some state s, event2 must occur in s's next state. No future state has an event2 in its next state (event2 only occurred at state0). So C3 is false.

C4: ""C1 and C3"" → false AND false = false.

C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" → C4 at state1 is false (by the same reasoning there is no later event2), so C5 is false.

C6: ""C5 always holds"" → false (C5 is already false at state0 and does not hold in all future states).

C7: ""C6 does not hold"" → since C6 is false, C7 is true.

C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" → at state1, C7 is true (the same reasoning about C6/C5 applies), so C8 is true at state0.

C9: ""C8 does not hold"" → since C8 is true, C9 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 is true.
- “After event1, event2 must happen” and “After event2, event1 must happen” imply the two events force each other to occur after the other (so starting from the initial event1, event2 must occur next, then event1 again, etc.). Thus both events will occur repeatedly along the trace.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1, C2, C3 are the same proposition: “event2 happens and event1 happens.” (Whether this means “both hold in the same state” or “both occur somewhere in the trace” is irrelevant for the final chain below because of C7.)
- C4: “If C2 then C3.” Since C2 and C3 are identical, C4 is a tautology and true in every state.
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” Since C4 holds in every state, C5 is true now.
- C6: “C5 always holds.” Because C4 holds everywhere, C5 holds in every state, so C6 is true.
- C7: “C6 eventually holds.” If C6 holds always, then it certainly holds eventually; so C7 is true.
- C8: “C1 holds or C7 holds.” We have C7 true, so C8 is true.
- C9: “C8 does not hold.” But C8 does hold, so C9 is false.

Conclusion
C9 is False.
---
You ask whether C9 is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. C1, C2, C3 are identical claims: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""  
2. C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are the same formula, C4 is a tautology (always true).  
3. C5 says C4 holds in the next state. Because C4 is a tautology it holds in every state, so C5 is true in every state.  
4. C6 says C5 always holds. From (3) this is true.  
5. C7 says C6 eventually holds. If C6 always holds, it certainly holds eventually, so C7 is true.  
6. C8 says ""C1 holds or C7 holds."" From (5) C7 is true, so C8 is true regardless of C1.  
7. C9 says ""C8 does not hold."" That contradicts (6), so C9 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- From the context: initially event1 holds, and the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating sequence event1, event2, event1, event2, … There is never a single state where both event1 and event2 hold simultaneously.

- Hence C1, C2 and C3 (""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" at a single state) are false in every state.

- C4 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true in every state.

- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is therefore true in the current state (since C4 holds everywhere). Consequently C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true, and C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is also true (in fact C6 holds immediately and always).

- C8 is ""C1 holds or C7 holds."" C7 is true, so C8 is true.

- C9 is ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 does hold, C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Sample responses:
Goal: is C7 (""C6 does not hold"") true or false?

Step 1 — understand context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen. So once the initial state with event2 has occurred, event1 can never occur in any later state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event1 cannot occur in the future (after the initial event2), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is vacuously true in any state where C1 is false. Since C1 is false, C2 is true (everywhere).
- C3 and C4: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is true in every state, C3 and C4 are true.
- C5: ""C3 or C4"" — true (both are true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 holds in every state, C6 is true.

Sample responses:
We treat states as: S0 (initial) where event1 happened, S1 (next) where event2 happens, and no S2 (after event2 no further states). Now evaluate each Ci at S0.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. holds at every reachable state from the point) — false at S0 because event2 does not hold in S0.
- C2: same as C1 — false at S0.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — true at S0 because at S1 C2 (G event2) does hold (event2 holds in S1 and there is no later state to contradict it).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — true at S0 because C3 is true at S1.
- C5: same as C1 — false at S0.
- C6: ""C4 or C5"" — true at S0 because C4 is true.
- C7: ""C1 and C6"" — false at S0 because C1 is false (even though C6 is true).
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — check at S1: at S1 C1 is true (event2 holds in all reachable states from S1), and C6 is true at S1 (C5 is true at S1), so C7 is true at S1; therefore C8 is true at S0.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — since C8 is true at S0, C9 is false.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event1 holds; then event2 must occur sometime after event1; after event2 no further events occur. So event2 occurs at one point but it is not true in the initial state and does not become permanently true in all future states.

- C1, C2, C5 (""Event2 always happens"" = □Event2) are false because event2 is not true in the initial state (and not true in every state).

- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"" = ◇□Event2) is false: there is no future state from which event2 holds in every subsequent state.

- C4 (next C3) is false; C6 (C4 ∨ C5) is false; C7 (C1 ∧ C6) is false; C8 (next C7) is false.

- C9 is ¬C8, so C9 is true.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

1. Identify the question
- C9 is the statement ""C8 does not hold."" We must determine if C9 is true in the given scenario.

2. Interpret the context as a trace
- State 0 (initial): event1 happened.
- Because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", at State 1: event2 happens.
- Because ""after event2, no other events can happen"", at State 2 and onward: no events (neither event1 nor event2).

3. Evaluate the conditions on that trace
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 is true at State1 but false at State2 and later).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That would require some future state at which C2 (event2 always happens from that point on) is true. There is no such state (after State1 event2 stops), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C3 is true at State1; C3 is false there, so C4 is false.
- C5: same as C1/C2. False.
- C6: ""C4 or C5."" Both are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C1 and C6."" Since C1 is false, C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" C7 is false at State1, so C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is false, C9 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen (after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).

Thus the actual occurrence history is: event2, then event1, then stop.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions in order using that history:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Antecedent true (event1 happens) and consequent true (event2 did happen earlier) → C1 is True.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 holds, and event1 does happen → C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both are true → C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 holds, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is True.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Same form as C2, so C7 is True.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" Both C6 and C7 are True, so the disjunction is True.

Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen — so event1 does happen (after the initial event2).
- After event1 no other events can happen — event1 is terminal.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True, because event2 has occurred initially, so whenever event1 happens it is after an event2.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 does hold, and event1 does happen (by the rule after event2), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both are true (C2 true; event2 happened initially), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False, because C3 does hold.

Step 1 — events:
- Initially event2 happened. The context also says “after event2, event1 must happen,” so event1 happens. Thus event1 = True and event2 = True.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions in order:

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 = True and event1 = True, so C2 is True.

Answer: False

Reasoning step by step

1. From the context: event2 happens initially, and after every event2 there must be an event1, and after every event1 there must be an event2. Thus event1 and event2 alternate forever. In particular event1 occurs (indeed infinitely often) along the execution.

2. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (follows from the alternation).

3. C2: same as C1, so True.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False (and in fact C2 holds at every state because event1 keeps recurring).

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is never true, so C4 is False.

6. C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (same as C1/C2).

7. C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Because C4 is False, C6 is False.

8. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is always False, so C7 is False.

9. C8: ""C1 holds and C7 holds."" C1 is True but C7 is False, so C8 is False.

10. C9: ""C8 always holds."" Since C8 is already false, C9 is False.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C9 (""C8 always holds"") is true in the given system.

Given system (temporal behaviour):
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After any event2, event1 must occur next.
- After any event1, event2 must occur next.
So the execution is an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... . In particular, from every state there will be a future state with event1 (indeed infinitely many).

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 happens next after the initial event2, and thereafter repeatedly).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2. Since C2 is True, C3 is False (and in fact never becomes true at any later state, because from every state event1 will still occur in the future, so C2 remains true everywhere).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = eventually(not C2). Because not C2 never holds, C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (same as C1/C2).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" That is False and True = False.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Since C6 is false at every state, C7 is False.
- C8: ""C1 holds and C7 holds."" True and False = False. In particular C8 is already false at the initial state.
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" This is false because C8 does not hold at the initial state (so it cannot hold always).

Final answer: False

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 occurs; after any event2 an event1 must occur; after any event1 an event2 must occur. So the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... Hence event1 occurs (indeed infinitely often) from the initial state and from every reachable state.

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (follows from initial event2 and the rule).

- C2: same as C1, so True.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is always False (C2 remains true), so C4 is False.

- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (same as C1/C2).

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Because C4 is False, C6 is False.

- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is always False, so C7 is False.

- C8: ""C1 holds and C7 holds."" C1 is True but C7 is False, so C8 is False.

- C9: ""C8 always holds."" C8 is False (and not true in any state), so C9 is False.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates event1, event2, event1, event2, ... hence event1 occurs infinitely often and in particular “event1 eventually happens” is true in every state.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1, C2, C3: all state “event1 eventually happens”. Each is true (and remains true in every state).
- C4: “C2 or C3” is true (since both C2 and C3 are true).
- C5: “C4 does not hold” is false (negation of a true statement).
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state” is false (C5 is false now and remains false in the next state).
- C7: “C1 and C6” is false (C6 is false).
- C8: “C7 always holds” is false (C7 is already false now).
- C9: “C8 holds in the next state” is false (C8 is false now and remains false).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Time 0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After an event1, event2 must happen next. After an event2, event1 must happen next.
- So the sequence of states is: time 0: event1, time 1: event2, time 2: event1, time 3: event2, … (event1 at every even time).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions at the initial state (time 0)
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 already happened at time 0, and it will happen again).
- C2: same as C1 → True.
- C3: same → True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" True (both are true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (since C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" At time 1, C5 is still false (C2/C3 remain true because event1 occurs again at time 2), so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" C1 is True but C6 is False → C7 is False.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" False (C7 is already false at time 0).
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" Since C8 is false, C9 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Timeline of states: at time 0 event1 has happened. After any event1, event2 must happen next; after any event2, event1 must happen next. So states alternate: event1 at 0, event2 at 1, event1 at 2, event2 at 3, etc. Thus event1 occurs now and at all even future states.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it has already happened at time 0, so ""eventually"" is satisfied).
- C2: same as C1, True.
- C3: same, True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" True (both are true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (since C4 is true).

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C7 (C3 holds and C6 holds) is true given the context and C1–C6. Step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen. So event1 is true initially, and event2 will happen (in the next state).

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, event1 does happen initially → C1 is False.

3. C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 happens, the disjunction is True → C2 is True.

4. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is already True, so C3 is True (and also event2 will happen by context).

5. C4: same as C3, so C4 is True.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" In the next state event2 happens, so C4 (which depends on event2 or C2) holds in the next state → C5 is True.

7. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" C5 does hold, and the context requires event2 after event1, so event2 does happen → the implication is True, so C6 is True.

8. C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" Both are True, so C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
You are asking whether C7 (C3 holds and C6 holds) is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Interpretation (standard state-based temporal reading):
- ""Event1 happens"" is true only in the state where event1 occurs; likewise for event2.
- ""Initially, event1 happened"" means event1 is true in the initial state and false thereafter.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means event2 must occur in some later state (not the initial one).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is not needed for the core evaluation below.

Evaluate conditions at the initial state:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — false in the initial state (event1 does happen initially).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" = event1 ∨ ¬event1 — this is true in every state (a tautology).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"" — since C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — C4 is true in every state, so C5 is true in the initial state.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens"" — C5 is true, so C6 reduces to ""event2 happens (in the initial state)"". But by the context event2 happens after event1, so event2 does not happen in the initial state; hence C6 is false.
- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds"" = true ∧ false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state: event1 happens.
- By the rules, in the next state event2 must happen.
- After the state where event2 happens, no further events occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (event1 does happen initially).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 happens, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.

Step 3 — look at the next state and C5–C6
- In the next state event2 happens (by the context).
- Evaluate C4 in that next state: event2 happens there, so C4 holds in the next state. Therefore C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true when evaluated in the initial state.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this as an implication evaluated in the initial state: C5 does hold, but event2 does not happen in the initial state (it happens only in the next state). So C6 is false.

Step 4 — combine for C7
- C7 = C3 ∧ C6. C3 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: event2 happened initially. Also after event2 no other events can happen (so event2 is already true and stays true), and after event1 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is false now and cannot become true later (event2 already happened and cannot be undone), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Event2 does happen (initially), so C3 is true regardless of C2.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Because C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: same as C4, also false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are false, so C6 is false.

Therefore C6 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
We must evaluate whether C6 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal, but it didn’t occur).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is false and cannot become true (event2 already happened and that cannot be undone), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" event2 happens is true, so C3 is true (the disjunction is true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is false because C3 is true.
- C5: same as C4, also false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are false, so their conjunction C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether C6 is True or False.

Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and likewise after event1 no other events can happen).

Evaluate each condition:

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false, because the context states event2 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is a statement that event2 never happens and that is already false (event2 occurred), C1 cannot become true later, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is false, but event2 did happen, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is true, so C4 is false.
- C5: same as C4 — false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are false, so their conjunction C6 is false.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after that initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing happens after event1).

From this we see event2 does occur (initially) but does not ""always"" happen (it occurs only initially, then event1 occurs and nothing else).

Step 2 — expand the Ci definitions
- C1: event2 always happens. (This is false given the context.)
- C2: C1 does not hold. (So C2 is true.)
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens. (C2 is true and event2 does happen initially, so C3 is true.)
- C4: C1 does not hold. (Same as C2, so C4 is true.)
- C5: event2 always happens. (Same as C1, so C5 is false.)
- C6: C4 holds or C5 holds. (True or false → C6 is true.)
- C7: C6 does not hold. (Negation of a true statement → C7 is false.)
- C8: C3 holds and C7 holds. (Requires both C3 true and C7 true.)

Step 3 — conclude
- C3 is true but C7 is false, so C8 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C8 is ""C3 holds and C7 holds"". We must decide if C8 is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — event sequence from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 does happen later.
- After event1, no other events can happen → sequence is event2 then event1 and then stop.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event2 always happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e. ¬C1).
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens (i.e. ¬C1 ∧ event2).
- C4: C1 does not hold (same as C2, i.e. ¬C1).
- C5: Event2 always happens (same as C1).
- C6: C4 holds or C5 holds = ¬C1 ∨ C1.
  - ¬C1 ∨ C1 is a logical tautology (always true).
- C7: C6 does not hold = ¬C6.
  - Since C6 is always true, C7 is always false.
- C8: C3 holds and C7 holds = (¬C1 ∧ event2) ∧ C7.
  - But C7 is false, so C8 is false regardless of C3.

Step 4 — conclusion
C8 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The question asks whether C8 (C3 holds and C7 holds) is true.
- Note C4 is ""C1 does not hold"" (¬C1) and C5 is ""Event2 always happens"" (C1). So
  C6 = C4 or C5 = ¬C1 or C1, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- Therefore C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is false.
- C8 = C3 and C7. Even if C3 were true, C7 is false, so the conjunction C8 is false."

We are asked whether C6 (C4 holds or C5 holds) is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur in any future state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant if event1 cannot occur).

Interpretation of the Ci:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" → in other words, in the next state, Event1 happens in the following state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" → similarly shifted one state further.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
- C5: ""C3 holds in the next state."" (same as C4)
- C6: C4 or C5.

Reasoning:
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, Event1 cannot happen in any future state. Therefore C1 is false.
- If C1 is false in any state, then C2 (which asserts C1 holds in a future state) is false; similarly C3, C4, and C5 are all false.
- Thus C6 = C4 or C5 = false or false = False.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""C4 holds or C5 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur in any future state after that initial point).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 will occur afterward).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is false in every state (because event1 cannot occur after event2), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Same reasoning, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" False.
- C5: ""C3 holds in the next state."" (same as C4) False.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are false, so C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C6 (C4 holds or C5 holds) is true given the context.

Key facts from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so there is no successor state where any event occurs).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 can never occur once event2 has happened.

Evaluate the conditions step by step (next means “in the immediate successor state”):
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” There is no next state (no events can happen after event2), so C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Because there is no next state, C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” False for the same reason.
- C4 and C5: each says “C3 holds in the next state.” Both are false.
- C6: “C4 holds or C5 holds” = false or false = false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — timeline from the context
- State 0 (initial): event1 happened.
- Because after event1 event2 must happen, State 1: event2 happened.
- Then State 2: event1 happened.
- Then State 3: event2 happened, etc.
So event2 holds at all odd-numbered states (1,3,5,...) and event1 at all even-numbered states (0,2,4,...).

Step 2 — interpret each Ci at the initial state (State 0)
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — at State 0 event2 does not happen, so C1 is false at State 0.
- C2: same as C1, so false at State 0.
- C3: same as C1, so false at State 0.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" From State 0, C3 will hold at State 1 (since event2 happens there). So C4 is true at State 0.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" At State 0 C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C5 is true at State 0.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true at State 0, C6 is false at State 0.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — i.e. C6 at State 1. We check C6 at State 1:
  - At State 1, C2 is true (event2 holds), and C4 (C3 eventually holds) is also true (from State 1, C3 holds at State 3). So C5 is true at State 1, hence C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false at State 1. Therefore C7 is false at State 0.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — i.e. C7 at State 1. But we just saw C7 is false at State 1 (because C6 is false at State 2 similarly), so C8 is false at State 0.
- C9: ""C1 holds or C8 holds."" At State 0 both C1 and C8 are false, so C9 is false at State 0.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - t=0 (initial): event1 is true, event2 is false.
   - t=1: by the rules, event2 must happen → event2 true, event1 false.
   - t=2: event1 must happen after event2 → event1 true, event2 false.
   - And so on (they alternate).

2. Evaluate the Ci at t=0 (unless a temporal operator shifts evaluation):
   - C1, C2, C3: each is ""event2 happens"" (redundant conjunction). At t=0 event2 is false → C1 = C2 = C3 = false.
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ ""event2 eventually holds"". From t=0 event2 occurs at t=1, so C4 = true.
   - C5: ""If C2 then C4"". C2 is false, so the implication is true → C5 = true.
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C5. Since C5 = true, C6 = false at t=0.
   - C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" → evaluate C6 at t=1. At t=1 event2 is true → C2 true at t=1; C4 (""event2 eventually"") is also true at t=1 (event2 holds now), so C6 at t=1 is false. Thus C7 = false at t=0.
   - C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" → evaluate C7 at t=1 (which would depend on C6 at t=2). C6 at t=2 is false (event2 is false at t=2), so C7 at t=1 is false, hence C8 = false at t=0.
   - C9: ""C1 holds or C8 holds"" → both are false at t=0, so C9 = false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event1 holds, and events alternate forever: state0 event1, state1 event2, state2 event1, state3 event2, ...
- C1, C2, C3 are all the same: ""event2 holds now."" That is false in the initial state (true in odd states).
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds."" True in the initial state because event2 occurs in the next state (and infinitely often thereafter).
- C5 = ""If C2 holds then C4 holds."" This implication is true: whenever event2 holds, event2 will occur again later, so C4 follows.
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false (everywhere).
- C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state."" False (C6 is false in the next state).
- C8 = ""C7 holds in the next state."" False.
- C9 = ""C1 holds or C8 holds."" Both disjuncts are false in the initial state, so C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Context gives: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 cannot happen at any time.
2. C1 and C2 (""event1 and event2"") are both false (event2 never happens).
3. C3 (C1 or C2) is false.
4. C4 (""eventually C3"") is false because nothing can change after the initial state, so C3 will never become true.
5. C5 (C4 in the next state) and C6 (C5 in the next state) are false.
6. C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true, since C6 is false.
7. C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true, because C7 holds now and will continue to hold in all future states (no events/change).
8. C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is therefore false.

So C9 is False.

First identify the timeline implied by the context:
- S0 (initial): event1 happened.
- S1 (after event1): event2 must happen.
- S2 and onward (after event2): no events happen.

Now evaluate the conditions on that timeline.

C1: ""Event1 always happens.""  
- False: event1 occurs at S0 but not at S1 or later, so C1 is not true at all states.

C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""  
- At S0 this asks whether C1 holds at S1. C1 is false at S1, so C2 is false at S0.

C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""  
- At S0 this asks whether C2 holds at S1. C2 is false at S1 (because C1 is false at S2), so C3 is false at S0.

C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens.""  
- C3 is false at all relevant states, so the implication is vacuously true wherever evaluated. Thus C4 holds.

C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""  
- Since C4 is true at all states, C5 is true at each state that has a next state.

C6: ""C1 holds in the next state.""  
- This is just like C2; C1 is false everywhere except S0, so C6 is false at S0 (and at most states).

C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds.""  
- We have C5 true (from above) and C6 false, so the implication is false wherever C5 is true. Hence C7 is false (e.g., at S0).

C8: ""C7 always holds.""  
- Since C7 is false at least at S0, C8 is false.

False

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happens initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2 nothing else can happen. So the actual trace contains event1 (at the start) and then event2, and then no more events.
- C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens""): true — whenever event2 happens in this system it is preceded by (and hence there is) an occurrence of event1 (in particular the initial event1).
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds""): true, because event1 does happen.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): true — C2 is true now (and nothing in the next state can invalidate the global fact that event1 happens or the fact C1 holds), so C2 holds in the next state.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds""): true, since C3 already holds in the next state.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold""): false, because C4 does hold.
- C6 (""C2 holds in the next state""): true (same as C3).
- C7 (""If C5 holds, then C6 holds""): true — the antecedent C5 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Sample responses:
We evaluate everything from the initial state s0 (where event2 holds). The context forces an alternating sequence: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, ...

1) C1 (event2 always happens). False (event2 does not hold at s1, s3, ...).

2) C2 (C1 or event2) at s0: C1 is false, event2 is true ⇒ C2 true at s0.

3) C3 (C2 does not hold) at s0: false (because C2 holds at s0).

4) C4 (C3 holds in the next state) at s0: evaluate C3 at s1. At s1, event2 is false and C1 false ⇒ C2 false, so C3 true at s1. Thus C4 is true at s0.

5) C5 (C4 or event1) at s0: C4 is true ⇒ C5 true at s0.

6) C6 (C5 eventually holds) at s0: since C5 already holds at s0, C6 is true.

7) C7 (C6 eventually holds) at s0: C6 holds now ⇒ C7 true.

8) C8 (C7 does not hold) at s0: false (C7 is true).

9) C9 (C8 holds in the next state) at s0: check C8 at s1. At s1 we recompute: C7 is true at s1 (because C5 holds at s1, so C6 and C7 hold), so C8 is false at s1. Therefore C9 is false at s0.

Final answer:
False
---
We need to decide whether C9 (X C8) is true, given the initial facts and the chain C1..C9.

Interpretation and system behavior
- Initial state s0: event2 holds.
- The context “After event2, event1 must happen” and “After event1, event2 must happen” give immediate alternation between event2 and event1:
  s0: event2
  s1: event1
  s2: event2
  s3: event1
  ... (alternating forever)

Evaluate the conditions state-by-state (G = always, F = eventually, X = next)

1. C1 = “Event2 always happens” (G event2). This is false: event2 does not hold at s1, s3, ...
2. C2 = C1 ∨ event2. Since C1 is false, C2 is equivalent to event2, so C2 is true at s0, s2, ... and false at s1, s3, ...
3. C3 = ¬C2. So C3 is true at s1, s3, ... and false at s0, s2, ...
4. C4 = X C3. Thus C4 is true at states whose next state is one where C3 holds. Because states alternate, C4 is true at s0, s2, ... and false at s1, s3, ...
5. C5 = C4 ∨ event1. At any state either event1 holds (odd states) or, at even states, C4 holds — so C5 is true at every state.
6. C6 = F C5. Since C5 holds now at every state, “eventually C5” is immediately true at every state, so C6 is true everywhere.
7. C7 = F C6. Similarly, C6 holds now everywhere, so C7 is true everywhere.
8. C8 = ¬C7. Since C7 is true everywhere, C8 is false everywhere.
9. C9 = X C8. Because C8 is false at every state, X C8 is false at every state.

Therefore C9 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (stepwise):
- From the context the events alternate: e2 at time 0, then e1 at time 1, then e2 at time 2, etc. So e2 is true at even times and false at odd times.
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false (e2 fails at time 1).
- C2 = (C1 or e2) therefore is true exactly at the times when e2 is true (even times) and false at odd times.
- C3 = (not C2) is true at odd times and false at even times.
- C4 = (C3 holds in the next state) is true at even times (because C3 is true at the following odd time) and false at odd times.
- C5 = (C4 or e1) is then true at every time (even times via C4, odd times via e1).
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true (C5 already holds now), and so is C7.
- C8 = (not C7) is therefore false at every time.
- C9 = (C8 holds in the next state) is false (C8 is false at every state, so also false in the next state).

Thus C9 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let t0 be the initial state. By the context:
  - At t0: event1 happened.
  - By “after event1, event2 must happen”, event2 happens at t1 (the next state).
  - By “after event2, no other events can happen”, no events occur at t2 and beyond.

Evaluate the Ci at t0 using next-state semantics:

1. C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” True at t0 because event2 occurs at t1.
2. C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens.” True at t0 because C1 is true.
3. C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Check C2 at t1:
   - At t1 C2 = (C1 at t1) or (event2 happens at t1). Event2 does happen at t1, so C2 is true at t1. Therefore C3 is true at t0.
4. C4: “C3 does not hold.” False at t0 because C3 is true.
5. C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” Check C4 at t1:
   - C4 at t1 is “C3 does not hold at t1.” C3 at t1 is “C2 holds at t2”. At t2 there are no events, so C2 is false at t2, so C3 at t1 is false, hence C4 at t1 is true. Thus C5 is true at t0.
6. C6: same as C2, so true at t0.
7. C7: “C5 holds or C6 holds.” True at t0 (both true).
8. C8: “C7 does not hold.” False at t0 because C7 holds.

Therefore C8 is False.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let s0 be the initial state (event1 happened), s1 the next state, s2 the state after that.
- From the context: event2 must happen after event1, so event2 occurs in s1. After event2 occurs (in s1), no further events occur in s2 or later.

Evaluate the Cs in s0:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" In s1 event2 happens → C1 is true.
2. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" C1 is true in s0, so C2 is true.
3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" In s1, C2 = (C1 in s1) or (event2 in s1). In s1, event2 does happen, so C2 is true in s1, hence C3 is true in s0.
4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is true, so C4 is false.
5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" In s1, evaluate C4: C4 = ""C3 does not hold (in s1)"". C3 at s1 says ""C2 holds in s2"". In s2, event2 does not occur and the nested C1 (about event2 in s3) is false, so C2 is false in s2; therefore C3 is false in s1, so C4 is true in s1. Thus C5 (C4 holds in the next state) is true in s0.
6. C6: same as C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") — true in s0.
7. C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" Both are true, so C7 is true.
8. C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is true, C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpret temporal operators: ""always"" = globally (G), ""in the next state"" = X, and propositions like ""Event2 happened"" are state predicates.
- From the context: initial state s0 has event2; after event2 event1 must occur, so s1 has event1; after event1 no further events occur, so s1 is terminal.
- Evaluate C1 = G(Event2): this requires Event2 to hold at every state. It holds at s0 but not at s1, so C1 is false at the initial state.
- C2 = G(C1) and C3 = G(C1) — both require C1 to hold at every state. Since C1 is already false at s0, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 = G(Event2) is the same as C1, so false. C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is therefore false.
- C6 = X(C5) is the value of C5 at s1; C5 is false at s1, so C6 is false. C7 = X(C6) is also false.
- C8 = C2 ∧ C7 is false ∧ false, hence false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context and temporal operators
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" means at the initial state (state 0) event2 holds.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" means in the state immediately after any state where event2 occurs, event1 occurs (so state1 has event1).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" means that once event1 occurs there is no further (nontrivial) future — no further events occur after state1.

I read ""always"" as the usual temporal ""globally"" (holds in every state) and ""in the next state"" as the usual next-step operator.

Step 2 — build the possible state sequence
Given the constraints the only feasible sequence is:
- state0: event2 (initial)
- state1: event1 (next)
- state2: no events (or no further states / no events after event1)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False — event2 holds in state0 but not in all states (it does not hold in state1 or later).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False — since C1 is false at the initial state, C1 does not hold in all states.
- C3: same as C2 → False.
- C4: same as C1 → False.
- C5: C3 and C4 → False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" The next state after the initial state is state1; C5 is false there → C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" That would require C6 to hold at state1 (so C6 true at state1), but C6 is false → C7 is False.
- C8: C2 and C7 → False AND False = False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context, event1 occurs initially, then event2 must happen, then event1 must happen, etc. So event1 does not hold in every state (it occurs at some states but not “always” / globally).
- Thus C1, C2, C5 (""Event1 always happens"") are false.
- C3 = C1 or C2 is false; C4 = always C3 is false.
- C6 (""If C5 holds, then event1 happens"") is true (the antecedent C5 is false, so the implication is vacuously true).
- Hence C7 = C4 or C6 is true. In the next state C5 is still false, so C6 is still true and C7 holds there, so C8 is true.
- C9 is ""C8 does not hold"", which is false.
---
Step 1 — model the timeline and rules
- Let S0 be the initial state. S0: event1 happened.
- The rules say: after event1, event2 must happen (so S1: event2 happens), and after event2, event1 must happen (so S2: event1 happens), etc. Thus event1 and event2 alternate: event1 at S0, S2, S4,... and event2 at S1, S3, ...

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at S0
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — false (event1 does not hold at S1, S3, ...).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: C1 or C2 — false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — false (C3 is false).
- C5: ""Event1 always happens"" — false (same as C1).
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication with antecedent C5 which is false, so C6 is true (vacuously). Also at S0 event1 actually does hold, but vacuity alone suffices.
- C7: C4 or C6 = false or true = true.

Step 3 — evaluate C8 and C9
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" means C7 at S1. At S1, C5 is still false, so C6 is still true, hence C7 is true at S1. Therefore C8 is true at S0.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" is the negation of C8. Since C8 is true, C9 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state (t0): event1 happened.
- Rules: after event1, event2 must happen (so at t1 if t0 had event1, t1 has event2); after event2, event1 must happen (so events alternate: t0:event1, t1:event2, t2:event1, …).

Step 2 — evaluate the named conditions at relevant states
- C1, C2, C5: each claims “Event1 always happens” (i.e., at every state). This is false: event1 does not occur at t1, t3, … so these “always” claims are false.
- C3 = C1 or C2: false or false = false.
- C4 = “C3 always holds”: since C3 is false at t0, C4 is false.
- C6 = “If C5 holds, then event1 happens.” C5 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C6 is true at any state.
- C7 = C4 or C6: false or true = true. So C7 holds at t0 and at t1.
- C8 = “C7 holds in the next state.” From t0, the next state is t1; C7 does hold at t1, so C8 is true at t0.
- C9 = “C8 does not hold.” Since C8 is true at t0, C9 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must determine whether C7 (the conjunction ""C5 holds and C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (i.e., whenever event2 happens, event1 will occur afterward)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (once event1 occurs, the trace ends)

- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the context statement ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: C1 always holds. The context gives C1 as a global rule, so C1 holds at all times → C2 is true.
- C3: C2 eventually holds. If C2 always holds then in particular it holds at some time → C3 is true.
- C4: C1 always holds. Same as C2, so true.
- C5: C3 holds and C4 holds. Both are true → C5 is true.
- C6: C1 always holds. Again true.
- C7: C5 holds and C6 holds. Both are true → C7 is true.

Step 3 — conclusion
All needed components are satisfied by the given context, so C7 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Identify the question:
- We must decide whether C7 is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context statement ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The context gives C1 as a system constraint (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur), so C1 holds at all times → C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 is true always, then it certainly holds at some time (eventually) → C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 always holds."" Same again, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Both C5 and C6 are true, so C7 is true.

Check consistency with event sequence:
- Initial event2 → by C1 event1 must occur after it → event1 occurs, then no further events can occur. This is consistent and does not contradict any Ci.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
We must decide whether C7 is true given the context. C7 is the conjunction ""C5 holds and C6 holds"", and C5 itself is ""C3 holds and C4 holds"". So we need to evaluate C1–C6 under the given scenario and see if C7 holds.

Step 2 — Translate the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches exactly ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Given the context supplies the rule ""after event2 event1 must happen"" universally, C1 holds in all states/traces — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is true already (at the initial time and at all times), it certainly holds at some time (indeed now), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 always holds."" Same again, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Both are true, so C7 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step

1. Interpret the context and timeline
- Initially (at the start state S0) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards.
- Rule: after event2 occurs, no other events can happen — so once event2 has happened the system reaches a terminal situation in which event1 cannot subsequently occur.

2. Evaluate the event formulas C1–C4
- C1, C3, C4 are all the same claim: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context (event2 already occurred initially and no events can occur after event2), event1 cannot hold at all times. So C1, C3, C4 are false in the model described by the context.

3. Evaluate C5 and C6
- C5 is ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 and C4 are identical, the implication C3 → C4 is a tautology (true) in classical logic. So C5 is true.
- C6 says ""C5 does not hold."" That contradicts the previous step, so C6 is false.

4. Evaluate C7 and C8
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" Since C7 is false, C8 is false.

5. Evaluate C2 and C9
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is false, and because event2 prevents event1 afterward, C1 does not hold in the next state — so C2 is false.
- C9 is C2 OR C8. Both disjuncts are false, so C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 cannot always happen (it cannot occur after the initial event2).
- C1, C3, C4 (""Event1 always happens"") are therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because C1 is false.
- C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true (it is an implication between identical claims).
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false because C5 does hold.
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false (C6 is false).
- C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C9 is ""C2 holds or C8 holds""; both C2 and C8 are false, so C9 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C3 and C4 are the same proposition: ""Event1 always happens."" So C5 is (C3 → C4), which is a tautology (P → P) and therefore holds.
- C6 asserts ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 does hold, C6 is false.
- C7 says ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is false, C7 is false.
- C8 says ""C7 holds in the next state."" Since C7 is false, C8 is false.
- Now consider C1 (""Event1 always happens""). Given the context — initially event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen — event1 cannot be true in all states, so C1 is false; therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false as well.
- C9 is C2 OR C8. Both disjuncts are false, so C9 is false."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event2 happened initially. Also the rules force alternation: after any event2 there must be an event1, and after any event1 there must be an event2. Therefore event2 does happen (initially and repeatedly thereafter).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen). So C1 is false.
   - C2: same as C1, so false.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is never true, so C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
   - C6: ""C1 holds and C5 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
   - C7: ""C6 holds and event2 happens."" C6 is false, so C7 is false (regardless of event2).
   - C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is false, so C8 is false.
   - C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" C8 is never true, so C9 is false.

3. Therefore C9 is False.
---
C9 asks whether ""C8 eventually holds."" We'll evaluate the chain under the given context.

1. Context implies event2 occurred initially, and thereafter event1 and event2 must alternate indefinitely (after any event2 there must be an event1, and after any event1 there must be an event2). So event2 does occur (in fact infinitely often).

2. C1 and C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" These are false at the initial moment (and false at many times), because event2 did happen initially and will happen again.

3. C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this says event2 never happens. That contradicts the context, so C3 is false.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — this would mean that from some future point on event2 never happens. Because the context forces infinite alternation, event2 keeps happening infinitely often, so there is no future point after which event2 never happens. Thus C4 is false. (Hence C5, which is just another eventuality of the same, is also false.)

5. C6 = C1 and C5 — false (both conjuncts are false).

6. C7 = C6 and event2 happens — impossible because C6 includes ""event2 does not happen""; C7 is false.

7. C8 = C7 always holds — false.

8. C9 = C8 eventually holds — since C8 is false, C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C9 is True or False.

Summary of initial facts:
- At the initial moment event2 happened.
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur later (event1 → eventually event2).
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur later (event2 → eventually event1).

These two obligations create an infinite alternation once event2 has occurred: initial event2 implies eventually an event1 will occur, which implies eventually another event2 will occur, which implies another event1, and so on. So event2 occurs now and will occur again (indeed infinitely often).

Now examine the Ci one by one:

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false at the initial moment because event2 did happen initially.
- C2 is the same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" i.e. ""event2 never happens at any time."" This is false because event2 already occurred (and will occur again).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" i.e. ""there is a future point after which event2 never happens."" This is impossible given the enforced alternation (event2 will keep occurring), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" is also false (since C4 is never true).
- C6: ""C1 and C5"" is false (both conjuncts false).
- C7: ""C6 and event2 happens"" is false.
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" is false.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds"" is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- By ""After event2, event1 must happen"" we take event1 to occur next (s1).
- By ""After event1, no other events can happen"" there are no events at s2 or later.

So timeline: s0: event2; s1: event1; no events after s1.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition under that timeline
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e. at s1) — False (event2 happened at s0, not at s1).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen (at s1), but C2 is False, so the implication is False.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is False, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" Event1 happens, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" C1 is False but C6 is True, so C7 is True.

- C9: ""C7 holds and C8 holds."" True and False → False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (evaluated at the initial state):
- Context gives: at state0 event2 happened; at state1 (the next state) event1 must happen; after event1 no further events occur.
- C1 / C2 / C8: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At state0 the next state is state1, but event1 (not event2) happens there. So C1, C2, C8 are false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" At state0 event1 does not happen, so the implication is vacuously true at state0.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 holds at state0 but event1 does not, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false at state0, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false at state0, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" Both are false, so C7 is false.
- C9: ""C7 holds and C8 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — timeline from the context
- Initially (state0) event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 happens in state1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events in state2 and later).

Step 2 — evaluate each claim in that timeline
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Interpreting ""next state"" as the state after the initial state (state1). In state1 event1 happens, not event2. So C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen (in state1), but C2 is false, so the implication is False.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 is false, so C4 is False.

Final answer: False

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 says ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
2. From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 happened initially, no other events (including event1) can happen. Therefore C1 is false.
3. C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" With C1 false, the implication C2 is vacuously true.
4. C3 = not(C2) is therefore false. C4 is the same as C3, so false.
5. C5 = not(C4) = true.
6. C6 = C3 or C5 = false or true = true.
7. C7 = not(C6) = not(true) = false.

Thus C7 is False.
---
Goal: determine whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" matches the context rule ""After event1, event2 must happen."" The context therefore makes C2 true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" is the negation of C2, so C3 is false (since C2 is true).
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" is the negation of C4, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C3 holds or C5 holds"" is False or True, hence C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" is the negation of C6, so C7 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 can never occur at any time.

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is false.

- C8 (""C7 always holds"") is false because C7 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" means no event2 can ever occur (there is no time before the initial state, and nothing can occur after the initial event1).
- C1 (event1 and event2 happen) is therefore false.
- C2 (C1 always holds) is false.
- C3 (C2 does not hold) is true.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds) is true (it already holds).
- C5 (C1 always holds) is false (same as C2).
- C6 (C4 and C5) is false (true and false -> false).
- C7 (C6 holds in the next state) is false.
- C8 (C7 always holds) is false.

Thus C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 holds.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, no further occurrences of event1 or event2 can occur (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — consequences of the context
- Because event1 holds initially and event1 is terminal, no events (in particular event2) can ever occur at any point in the execution.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — false (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — false (C1 is false now).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — true (C2 is false).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — true (C3 already holds).
- C5: ""C1 always holds"" — false (same as C2).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — false (true ∧ false = false).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — false (C6 is false now, so next(C6) is false).
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" — false (C7 is not true now, so it cannot be always true).

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never happens. (Also the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)
- C1 and C2 (""Event2 does not happen"") are true.
- C3 and C4 (""C2 does not hold"", i.e. event2 does happen) are false.
- C5 (C3 or C4) is false.
- C6 (C5 holds in the next state) is false.
- C7 (if C1 then C6): antecedent C1 is true, consequent C6 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8 (""C7 always holds"") is therefore false.
---
First, what is being asked:
- C8 asserts that C7 ""always holds"" (i.e., in every state C7 is true). We must decide whether C8 is true or false given the event constraints.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1 no other events can happen. After event2, event1 must happen.
- From the context, once the initial state (where event1 occurred) is reached, no events can ever occur afterwards. Hence event2 cannot occur at any time.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — true.
- C2: same as C1 — true.
- C3 and C4: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is true, C3 and C4 are false.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — false (both disjuncts false).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is a next state but, because no events happen after event1, C5 is still false there, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true but C6 is false, so the implication is false (true → false = false).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" Because C7 is already false in the initial state, C8 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So from the initial state onward, event2 does not happen.
2. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") and C2 (same) are true.
3. C3 and C4 are ""C2 does not hold"", so both are false (since C2 holds).
4. C5 = C3 or C4, so C5 is false.
5. C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"". That is false (next-state C5 is false; if there is no next state, X-claims are not true).
6. C7 = ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"". C1 is true while C6 is false, so the implication C7 is false in the initial state.
7. C8 = ""C7 always holds"" is therefore false.

Thus C8 is False."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C8 (""If event2 happens, then C7 holds"") is true given the context.

Context facts:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Hence event1 does not happen.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen — true.
- C2: Event1 does not happen — true.
- C3: C2 does not hold — false (because C2 holds).
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds — true (C1 is true).
- C5: C2 does not hold — false.
- C6: Event1 happens or C5 holds — false (neither holds).
- C7: If C4 holds, then C6 holds — false, because C4 is true but C6 is false.
- C8: If event2 happens, then C7 holds — false, because event2 is true but C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify given facts:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 happens (true).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen (true).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. True.
- C2: Event1 does not happen. True.
- C3: C2 does not hold. False (because C2 is true).
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds. True (C1 is true).
- C5: C2 does not hold. False.
- C6: Event1 happens or C5 holds. False (both disjuncts are false).
- C7: If C4 holds, then C6 holds. False (C4 is true but C6 is false).

Step 3 — evaluate C8:
- C8: If event2 happens, then C7 holds. Antecedent is true (event2 happens) but consequent C7 is false, so C8 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — from the context:
- event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. True.
- C2: Event1 does not happen. True.
- C3: C2 does not hold. Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds. C1 is True, so C4 is True.
- C5: C2 does not hold. False (same as C3).
- C6: Event1 happens or C5 holds. Both disjuncts are False, so C6 is False.
- C7: If C4 holds, then C6 holds. C4 is True but C6 is False, so C7 is False.
- C8: If event2 happens, then C7 holds. event2 is True but C7 is False, so C8 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 happens following the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is the last event).

So in this scenario event1 and then event2 occur; event2 does occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 happened initially and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does occur. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is true and event2 happens, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 happened initially, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Same as C3, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" C4 is false but C5 is true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So the only possible sequence consistent with the context is: event1, then event2, then nothing else.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 happened initially and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does occur in the only possible execution. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is true and event2 does happen, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 did happen initially, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 does hold, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" This is identical in content to C3, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" C4 is false, C5 is true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 happened and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does occur. So C1 is true in this scenario.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Both parts are true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" event1 did happen initially and C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state after the initial state, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (events alternate).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions in that next state:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state. True (by ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and initial event2).
- C2: Event1 happens in the next state. Same as C1, so True.
- C3: Event2 happens or C2 holds. Since C2 is True, C3 is True.
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. C1 is True and C3 is True, so C4 is True. In fact C4 is tautologically true because C3 includes C2 which equals C1.
- C5: C4 always holds. Given C4 is (effectively) a tautology here, C5 is True.
- C6: C5 does not hold. This negates C5, so C6 is False.
- C7: Event2 happens or C2 holds. Same as C3, so True.
- C8: C6 holds and C7 holds. C6 is False and C7 is True, so the conjunction is False.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context (interpreting states):
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after an event2-state is an event1-state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after an event1-state is an event2-state).
Thus the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is true in any state where the current event is event2 (because after event2 the next is event1). In the initial state (where event2 happened) C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true in the same states (including the initial state).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" In a state where current event is event2 this is true (first disjunct). In a state where current event is event1, C2 is true about the next state? No — in an event1-state the next is event2 so C2 (which asserts next is event1) is false; the first disjunct is false too, so C3 is false in event1-states. But in the initial event2-state C3 is true (because event2 is true).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Consider both kinds of states:
  - In an event2-state: C1 true and C3 true ⇒ implication true.
  - In an event1-state: C1 false ⇒ implication true.
So C4 holds in every state.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" From the previous point, C4 indeed holds in all states, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" This contradicts C5, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" This is the same formula as C3; it is true in event2-states and false in event1-states. Its truth varies with the state, but in any case it does not rescue C6.

3. C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" Since C6 is false, the conjunction C8 is false regardless of C7.

Therefore C8 is False."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true or false given the context. Step-by-step:

Context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Also: after event1 no other events can happen.)

From this, event2 has occurred and no further events (including event1) can occur.

Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" True (event2 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True (C1 already holds).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" False (event1 does not and cannot happen).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" False (requires event1).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" True (C4 is false).
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" True vacuously, because event1 never happens.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" True (C6 holds now).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" True (C7 holds and no future changes are possible).
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" False (C8 does hold).

Final answer: False
---
Let's go step by step.

Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (So event1 cannot happen at any time after the start.)

C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just ""event2 happens"". True (given by context).

C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds initially, so C2 is True.

C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 does not happen (it is prevented by the fact that event2 already happened and no further events can occur). So C3 is False.

C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" C3 is False, so C4 is False.

C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is False, C5 is True.

C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" C5 is already True, so the implication is True (a true consequent makes the conditional true regardless of the antecedent). So C6 is True.

C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 holds now, so C7 is True.

C8: ""C7 always holds."" Since no further events can change truth values after the initial event2, C7 continues to hold at all future times; thus C8 is True.

C9: ""C8 does not hold."" But C8 is True, so C9 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event2 happens. After event2, no other events can happen (so event1 never happens, because event2 is the initial event and it forbids any further events). Also after event1 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is simply ""event2 happens"" and is true (it happens initially).

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True, because C1 already holds now.

- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" False, because event1 does not happen.

- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" False (C3 is false, and event1 does not happen).

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" True (since C4 is false).

- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" This implication is vacuously true (event1 never happens), so C6 is true.

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" True (C6 already holds).

- C8: ""C7 always holds."" True — since nothing changes after the initial event2, C7 continues to hold at all times.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" This is false because C8 does hold.

Therefore C9 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (which is ""C5 holds and C6 holds"") is true given the context and the other Ci definitions.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. ""After event1, event2 must happen"" (event1 → event2). ""After event2, no other events can happen"" (event2 is terminal).
- C1: event2 → event1.
- C2: event2 → event1 (same as C1).
- C3: C1 ∧ C2.
- C4: C3 → event1.
- C5: C4 always holds (so treat C4 as true).
- C6: C1 ∧ C2 (same as C3).
- C7: C5 ∧ C6.

Step 3 — reason about truth values
- The context does not imply event2 → event1. The rule given is event1 → event2, not the converse. So C1 (and C2) are not supported by the context and are false (or at least not provable).
- Therefore C3 and C6 (which are C1 ∧ C2) are false.
- C4 (C3 → event1) is true vacuously because C3 is false.
- C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given C4 is true.
- C7 = C5 ∧ C6 = true ∧ false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (C5 holds and C6 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate context briefly
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" The context gives no rule that event2 implies event1. In fact, since event2 happened initially and no events can occur after it, there is no reason to conclude event1 happened. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — false ∧ false = false. So C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — same as C3, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds"" — true ∧ false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- C7 is the conjunction C5 and C6. We must determine whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C6 (C1 and C2)
- C1 and C2 both say: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen.
- For C1 (and C2) to be true, event1 would have to happen as well. The context gives no fact that event1 happened; moreover, ""After event2, no other events can happen"" prevents any event1 occurring after that initial event2, and nothing says event1 occurred before it. Thus event1 is not entailed.
- Therefore C1 (and C2) are not true, so C6 = C1 and C2 is false.

Step 3 — conclude about C7
- C7 = C5 and C6. Even if C5 held, C6 is false, so the conjunction C7 is false.

- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 happens, event1 will happen again, and they keep forcing each other).

Conclusion: event2 does happen.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Since event2 does happen, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is False, C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Event2 happens (True) and C3 is True, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C2 does not hold."" Same as C3, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are True, so the implication is True; C6 is True.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is True, C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You ask whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — simplify the C-conditions using propositional logic
- C1: Event2 happens and event2 happens. This is equivalent to Event2.
- C2: C1 does not hold = not C1 = not(Event2).
- C3: C2 does not hold = not C2 = not(not Event2) = Event2.
- C4: Event2 happens and C3 holds = Event2 and Event2 = Event2.
- C5: C2 does not hold = not C2 = Event2.
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds = If Event2 then Event2. This is a tautologically true implication (and in any case, with Event2 true it is true).
- C7: C6 does not hold = not C6.

Step 3 — use the context to determine Event2
Context: initially Event1 happened, and ""after Event1, Event2 must happen."" Therefore Event2 does happen (at least at some later point).

Step 4 — evaluate C6 and C7
- Because Event2 does happen, C4 and C5 are both true, so C6 (If Event2 then Event2) holds.
- C7 is ""C6 does not hold"", i.e. the negation of a true statement, so C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Goal: determine whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 1 — derive what events occur from the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so event2 does happen (follows from the context).
- After event2, event1 must happen → consistent with the cyclic requirement, but we only need that event2 does occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Equivalent to ""Event2 happens."" True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Both parts true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 does not hold."" Same as C3, true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 is true and C5 is true, so the implication is true (C6 holds).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 holds, C7 is false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", i.e. simply ""event2 happens"". By the context, event2 happened initially, so C1 is true.

2. C2 and C3 are both ""C1 does not hold"" (¬C1). Since C1 is true, C2 and C3 are false.

3. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"". C3 is false (¬C1) and cannot become true because event2 has already happened (C1 is true as a global fact of the trace), so C4 is false.

4. C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is therefore false. C6 (""C5 holds or event1 happens"") is false because C5 is false and event1 never happens (after event2 no other events can happen). C7 is the same and is false.

5. C8 is ""C2 holds and C7 holds"". Both C2 and C7 are false, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine whether C8 (""C2 holds and C7 holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no future event1 or event2 can occur after that initial occurrence).
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (but event1 does not occur here because event2 already happened initially and prevents further events).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions one by one
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Given the context (event2 happened initially), C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 (""C1 does not hold""), so C3 is also false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and will remain false (no events change C1), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false now and remains false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" C5 is false, and event1 cannot happen (no events after event2), so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C2 holds and C7 holds."" C2 is false and C7 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — initial situation
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So the system is stuck after the initial state: event2 is true and no future events (including event1) can occur.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3
- C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". That holds (true) in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore false.
- C3: same as C2, also false.

Step 3 — propagate to C4–C7
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 is false now and nothing can change (no future events), C3 will never become true, so ""eventually C3"" is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — there is no next state with any changes, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens"" — both disjuncts are false (C5 false; event1 cannot happen), so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens"" — likewise false.

Step 4 — C8
- C8 is ""C2 holds and C7 holds"". Both C2 and C7 are false, so C8 is false.

Sample responses:
First identify what each Ci means (all evaluated at the same state unless otherwise indicated):

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 = C1.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 = C1. (same as C3)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬C4 = ¬C1.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds"" = C1 ∧ ¬C1 (a contradiction, always false in any given state).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" (there is some future state where C6 is true).

Now use the given system facts:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so in the very next state event1 does happen (C1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened the system has no further events.

Because C6 is C1 ∧ ¬C1, C6 is unsatisfiable in any single state (it cannot be true in any state). Therefore there is no state—now or later—where C6 holds, so ""eventually C6 holds"" (C7) is false.

Final answer: False
---
First, what is being asked: C7 says ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide if that can be true given the definitions and the context.

Evaluate the conditions step by step (let A mean ""Event1 happens in the next state""):

- C1 = A.
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬A.
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬(¬A) = A.
- C4 = ""C2 does not hold"" = A (same as C3).
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬A.
- C6 = C3 ∧ C5 = A ∧ ¬A, which is a contradiction (always false).
- C7 = ""eventually C6"" — since C6 is impossible (contradiction), it can never become true, so C7 is false.

(The given context about event2 and event1 does not remove the logical contradiction in C6; at best it forces A to be true eventually, but C6 requires A and ¬A simultaneously, which is impossible.)

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — expand the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold = not C1.
- C3: C2 does not hold = not(not C1) = C1.
- C4: C2 does not hold = C1 (same as C3).
- C5: C4 does not hold = not C1 = C2.
- C6: C3 holds and C5 holds = C1 and (not C1) — a contradiction, i.e. C6 is false in every state.
- C7: C6 eventually holds — requires C6 to be true at some future state.

Step 3 — reasoning with the context:
The context constraints about event1/event2 don’t matter here because C6 is logically impossible (it requires both C1 and not C1 simultaneously). Therefore C6 can never hold, so it cannot “eventually hold.”

Step 1 — What is asked
We must determine the truth of C7 (""C6 does not hold"") given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — Interpret the context
- Initially (at the initial state) event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (unused because event2 never occurs here).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events occur in any later state).

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions at the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Since event1 happens initially, C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In the next state there are no events (because after event1 no other events can happen), so event1 does not hold there; thus C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and will never become true (no events will make C2 true later), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C2 always holds."" This repeats C3’s claim about C2 and is false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both parts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Final answer:

Answer: True

Step-by-step:
- C1 asserts event1 happens (redundantly). That holds initially because the context says event1 happened initially.
- C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state. But the context says “after event1, no other events can happen” — there is no next state in which C1 could hold. So C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") and C5 (same as C2 always holds) therefore are false.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 never becomes true.
- C6 (""C4 and C5"") is false (both conjuncts false).
- C7 asserts ""C6 does not hold"". Since C6 is false, C6 indeed does not hold, so C7 is true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Given the context, event1 has already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur next. So C1 is false.

- C2 and C3: both are “eventually C1 holds.” Since C1 is false and no future can produce event2, C2 and C3 are false.

- C4: “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” Because C2 and C3 are the same proposition, and here C2 is false, the implication C2 → C3 is true (false antecedent makes implication true). So C4 is true.

- C5: “Event1 happens or C4 holds.” Event1 does hold in the initial state, and C4 holds as well, so C5 is true in the initial state.

- C6: “C5 always holds.” In any future state after event1, event1 itself won’t hold, but C4 still holds (as shown above), so C5 holds in every state. Therefore C6 is true.

- C7: “C6 does not hold.” This is false because C6 is true.

- C8: “C7 holds in the next state.” C7 is false (everywhere), so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — set the timeline
- Let s0 be the initial state. At s0 event1 has happened.
- Rule “After event1, no other events can happen” means no events (including event2) can occur at any state after s0 (s1, s2, ...).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” That would require event2 at s1. Impossible because no events can occur after s0. So C1 is false at s0 (and at every state).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Since C1 never holds at any future state, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, false.
- C4: “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” An implication with false antecedent is true, so C4 is true (true at every state).
- C5: “Event1 happens or C4 holds.” Event1 is true at s0, and C4 is true at all states, so C5 is true at all states.
- C6: “C5 always holds.” Since C5 holds at every state, C6 is true.
- C7: “C6 does not hold.” This negates a true statement, so C7 is false (at all states).
- C8: “C7 holds in the next state.” Because C7 is false everywhere, C8 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify goal
- We must determine whether C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context and the Ci definitions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can ever occur in any future state.

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci one by one
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False (event2 can never happen).
- C2 and C3: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is false in every state, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is p -> p (same p), which is always true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" C4 is always true, so C5 is true in every state.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True (we just concluded C5 holds in all states).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False (because C6 does hold).
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" False (C7 is false, so it does not hold in the next state).

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: at time 0 (initially) event2 happens. After event2, no other events can happen, so event1 never happens at any time.

- C1 = ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" — false (event1 never happens).

- C2 = ""if event2 happens then C1"" — at the initial time event2 does happen but C1 is false, so C2 is false at the initial time.

- C3 is the same as C1 — false.

- C4 = ""if C2 then C3"" — since C2 is false at the initial time, C4 is true at the initial time (false implies anything).

- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" — in the next state event2 no longer ""happens"", so C2 becomes true there (premise false → true) while C3 remains false; thus C4 is false in the next state, so C5 is false at the initial time.

- C6 = ""event1 happens or C5"" — both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.

- C7 is the same as C2 — false at the initial time.

- C8 = C6 and C7 — both conjuncts are false, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. From the context: initially event2 happened. There is no information that event1 happened. Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means there is no next state with events (so any ""next"" proposition is false).

2. Evaluate each Ci in the initial state:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Event2 is true but event1 is not given, so C1 is false.
   - C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 is true, C2 is equivalent to C1, so C2 is false (because C1 is false).
   - C3: same as C1, so false.
   - C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true — C4 is true.
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no meaningful next state after event2, so next(C4) is false — C5 is false.
   - C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
   - C7: same as C2, so false.
   - C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — initial facts
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).
- Event1 did not happen in the initial state.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1 (event2 and event1): false (event1 did not happen).
- C2 (if event2 then C1): false, because event2 is true but C1 is false.
- C3 (event2 and event1): same as C1, false.
- C4 (if C2 then C3): true (material implication with false antecedent C2).
- C5 (C4 holds in the next state): false, because there is no next state after the terminal state.
- C6 (event1 or C5): false (both disjuncts false).
- C7 (if event2 then C1): same as C2, false.
- C8 (C6 and C7): false (C6 is false, so the conjunction is false).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Context forces event2 to occur initially and then repeatedly (event2 → event1 → event2 …), so ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds""), C3 (same), C4 (""C3 eventually holds""), and C5 (same as C1) are all false.
- C6 is the implication (C4 → C5). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true (vacuously).
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true because C6 holds (and there is no change that would make it false).
- C8 is (C2 → C7). Since C2 is false, the implication is true.

Thus C8 is True.

Step 1 — interpret the setting and temporal operators:
- Initially event2 has happened, so at the current moment event2 is true.
- After event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen, so the system stays in this same state forever.
- Use standard temporal reading: ""eventually"" (F) can be satisfied now (if the proposition already holds), and ""always"" (G) means it holds at all future times (including now).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 has already happened.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True (both disjuncts are true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True, since C2 holds now.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False, because C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" True, negation of a false statement.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" True, since C5 holds now.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" True — C6 holds now and no events occur to change that, so it holds at all future times.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" True, since C7 holds now.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" False, because C8 is true.

Final answer:
False
---
We evaluate each condition given the context: initially event2 has happened, and after either event1 or event2 no further events can occur (so the state is terminal after event2).

1. C1 (event2 eventually happens): True — event2 already happened initially, so ""eventually"" is satisfied.
2. C2 (event2 happens or C1 holds): True — both disjuncts are true, so C2 is true now.
3. C3 (C2 eventually holds): True — C2 is true now and remains true (no further events), so C3 holds.
4. C4 (C3 does not hold): False — C3 does hold, so C4 is false.
5. C5 (C4 does not hold): True — C4 is false, so its negation is true.
6. C6 (C5 eventually holds): True — C5 holds now, so ""eventually"" holds.
7. C7 (C6 always holds): True — C6 holds now and will continue to hold (no further events), so it always holds.
8. C8 (C7 eventually holds): True — C7 already holds, so ""eventually"" holds.
9. C9 (C8 does not hold): False — C8 is true, so C9 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" From the context, event2 happens initially and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur. Therefore C1 is false.

- C2 and C3: each says ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false.

- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never becomes true (no further events can change truth), so C5 is false.

- C6, C7, C8: each asserts that the previous condition ""always holds."" Since the previous ones are false, each of these is false; in particular C8 is false.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1..C8.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 is required).

Since event2 is already the initial event and no events can occur after it, event1 cannot occur after event2. There is no earlier time before the initial state to have event1, so event1 does not happen at all.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Event2 does happen, but event1 does not; so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" false or false = false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false now and no future changes are possible (no events after event2), so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" false.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" false.

Final answer
False
---
Summary:
- Initially event2 has occurred, and after event2 no further events can occur. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time (it can't occur after event2, and there is no earlier time before the initial state).
- C1 requires both event2 and event1 to happen — false (event1 never happens).
- Since C1 is false, any statement claiming C1 ""always holds"" (C2, C3, etc.) is false; thus C4 (C2 or C3) is false, C5 (eventually C4) is false, and so on up the chain.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 did happen initially, event2 cannot happen at any time. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is True.

2. C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Given event2 never happens at any time, C1 is indeed always true, so C2 is True.

3. C3 says ""C2 does not hold"" — this contradicts step 2, so C3 is False. C4 is the same statement, so C4 is also False.

4. C5 is ""C3 holds and C4 holds"" — since both C3 and C4 are False, C5 is False.

5. C6 is ""C5 always holds"" — C5 is False, so C6 is False.

6. C7 is ""C6 always holds"" — since C6 is False, C7 is False.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Therefore, once event1 has happened (and it did initially), event2 cannot happen at any time afterwards. So event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (from above).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — True, because event2 never happens at any future time (event1 already prevents any other events).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — False (C2 does hold).
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" — False (same as C3).
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" — False (both C3 and C4 are false).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" — False (C5 is false now, so it cannot be always true).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" — False (C6 is false).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C7.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so the whole execution is: event1 occurs and then nothing else.
- (The fact ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in this execution.)

Step 3 — evaluate conditions one by one
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because after event1 no other events occur, so event2 does not happen.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event2 never happens at any time in this execution, C1 holds at all times; so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False, because we just found C2 is True.
- C4: same as C3, also False.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" False (both conjuncts are false).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" False, since C5 is false (so it does not hold now or always).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" False, because C6 is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 is true now and event1 never happens in the future.

2. C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true because event2 already happened (eventually includes the current state).

3. C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is true (both conjuncts true now). C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is true.

4. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true because C3 already holds now.

5. C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false because C4 is true.

6. C6 (""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"") is false now, because C2 is true but C5 is false, so the implication fails.

7. C7 (""C6 holds in the next state""):
   - If there is no next state (system halts after event2), then C7 is false.
   - If there is a next state, C2 will typically be false there (event2 was only at the initial state), so the implication in C6 would be vacuously true in that next state and C7 would be true. Either way, C7 may be false or true depending on the existence/semantics of the next state, but we can continue to the final conjunct.

8. C8 (""C7 holds and event1 happens"") requires event1 to happen. But event1 never happens (after event2 no other events occur and event1 did not occur initially). Therefore C8 is false regardless of C7.

Thus C8 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 has occurred and event1 never happens anywhere after that.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" True (C1 true and event2 did happen).
- C3: same as C2, so True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True (C3 holds now, so it holds eventually).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (C4 is true).
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" False (C2 is true but C5 is false, so the implication is false).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" There is no way to make this true: after event2 there are no further events/states where C6 could hold, and C6 is already false now, so C7 is not true.
- C8: ""C7 holds and event1 happens."" False (C7 does not hold, and event1 never happens after event2).

Therefore C8 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial state S0: event2 has happened.
- C1 (event2 eventually happens): True (it already happened).
- C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens): True (C1 true and event2 holds in S0).
- C3 (same as C2): True.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds): True (C3 already holds).
- C5 (C4 does not hold): False (C4 holds).
- C6 (if C2 then C5): False (C2 is true but C5 is false, so the implication fails).
- C7 (C6 holds in the next state): False — there is no state after S0 in which events can occur (after event2 no other events can happen), and in any case C6 is false now so ""next"" cannot make it true.
- C8 (C7 holds and event1 happens): False because C7 is false (and event1 never happens after event2).

Reasoning:
- From the context: event1 is true, and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 is false.
- C1–C4 are each ""event1 and event2"", so they are false (event2 is false).
- C5 = C3 and C4 is false.
- C6 = (event1 → C5). Since event1 is true but C5 is false, C6 is false.
- C7 = C2 or C6 is false.
- C8 = (C1 → C7). C1 is false, so the implication is true.
- C9 asserts ""C8 does not hold"", but C8 does hold, so C9 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not happen (it cannot happen after event1, and event1 already happened initially).

2. C1–C4 each assert “event1 happens and event2 happens.” Since event2 does not happen, C1–C4 are all false.

3. C5 is “C3 holds and C4 holds.” Because C3 and C4 are false, C5 is false.

4. C6 is “If event1 happens, then C5 holds.” Event1 does happen, but C5 is false, so the implication is false; C6 is false.

5. C7 is “C2 holds or C6 holds.” Both C2 and C6 are false, so C7 is false.

6. C8 is “If C1 holds, then C7 holds.” C1 is false, so this implication is vacuously true. Therefore C8 holds (is true).

7. C9 states “C8 does not hold.” Because C8 does hold, C9 is false.

Thus C9 is False."

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let N = ""next"" and F = ""eventually"". Translate the Ci:
  - C1 = N(event2).
  - C2 = F(C1).
  - C3 = F(C2).
  - C4 = N(C3).
  - C5 = N(C4).
  - C6 = (event2 -> C5).
  - C7 = F(C6).
  - C8 = not C7.
  - C9 = (event1 and C8).

- From the context: at the initial state s0 event1 holds, and at some later state s_k event2 holds (event2 must happen after event1). For every state before s_k, event2 is false.

- At any state where event2 is false, the implication event2 -> C5 is vacuously true. In particular, C6 is true at s0 (and at all states before s_k).

- Since C6 is true at some (indeed many) future states, F(C6) holds, so C7 is true.

- Therefore C8 = not C7 is false. Thus C9 = event1 and C8 is false (event1 may be true, but C8 is false).

So C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C9 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- We evaluate everything from the initial state s0 where event2 has happened.
- Because after event2, event1 must happen, the next state s1 has event1 (and not event2).
- C5 is (C3 or C4). At s1:
  - C4 asserts event2 (redundantly); it is false at s1.
  - C3 is ""if event2 then C2"". Since event2 is false at s1, C3 is vacuously true.
  - Therefore C5 is true at s1.
- C6 says ""C5 holds in the next state"" (i.e. at s1). So C6 is true at s0.
- C7 = not C6 is false at s0.
- C8 = not C7 is true at s0.
- C9 = not C8 is false at s0.

Thus C9 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

- From the context, states alternate: initially (state s0) event2 is true; after event2, event1 must hold (so s1: event1); after event1, event2 must hold (s2: event2), etc.

- Evaluate at the initial state s0:
  - C1 = (event2 ∧ event2) = true (since event2 holds at s0).
  - C2 = (C1 → event2) = (true → true) = true.
  - C3 = (event2 → C2) = (true → true) = true.
  - C4 = same as C1 = true.
  - C5 = (C3 ∨ C4) = true ∨ true = true.

- C6 = “C5 holds in the next state” = C5 at s1. Compute C5 at s1:
  - At s1 event1 holds, so C1 and C4 (which require event2) are false at s1.
  - C2 at s1 is (false → event2) = true; C3 at s1 is (event2 → C2) = (false → true) = true.
  - Thus C5 at s1 = true ∨ false = true. Therefore C6 at s0 = true.

- C7 = ¬C6 = false.
  C8 = ¬C7 = true.
  C9 = ¬C8 = false.

Thus C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — set the timeline from the context
- Initially (call this time t0): event2 happened.
- From the rules: after event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen. So the sequence is alternating: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, …

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at t0 (unless they explicitly refer to the next state)
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — true at t0 (event2 occurred).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds and event2 does happen at t0, C2 is true at t0.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" At t0 event2 happens and C2 is true, so C3 is true at t0.
- C4: same as C1, so true at t0.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — true at t0 (both hold).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — this refers to t1. At t1 event1 happens (not event2), so:
  - C3 at t1: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 does not happen at t1, so the implication is vacuously true; hence C3 is true at t1. Therefore C5 is true at t1, so C6 is true at t0.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — since C6 is true at t0, C7 is false at t0.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — C7 is false, so C8 is true at t0.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — C8 is true, so C9 is false at t0.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no time before the initial moment, and nothing can happen after event2).

2. Simplify the Ci formulas:
   - C1 = (event1 and event2). Since event1 does not occur, C1 is false.
   - C2 = (C1 or event1) which is equivalent to event1. So C2 is false.
   - C3 = (C2 and event1) which reduces to event1, so false.
   - C4 = (event2 and C3) = event2 and event1, so false (event1 is false).
   - C5 = (C2 and event1) = false.
   - C6 = (C4 and C5) reduces to (event1 and event2), so false.

3. C7 asserts ""C6 always holds."" But C6 is false (it does not hold), so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no further events (including event1) can occur after that initial moment.
- Therefore event1 does not happen, while event2 does.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: event1 and event2 → False (event1 does not happen).
- C2: C1 or event1 → False.
- C3: C2 and event1 → False.
- C4: event2 and C3 → False.
- C5: C2 and event1 → False.
- C6: C4 and C5 → False.
- C7: C6 always holds → False (C6 is false, so it cannot ""always hold"").

Thus C7 is False.
---
First identify the claim: C7 says ""C6 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true at the initial (and only relevant) point.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 already happened initially, event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no earlier event1 and nothing can occur after event2).

Therefore:
- event2: true
- event1: false

Evaluate the Ci:
- C1 = (event1 happens) and (event2 happens) = false and true = false.
- C2 = C1 or event1 = false or false = false.
- C3 = C2 and event1 = false and false = false.
- C4 = event2 and C3 = true and false = false.
- C5 = C2 and event1 = false and false = false.
- C6 = C4 and C5 = false and false = false.

C6 is false at the (initial) point, so ""C6 always holds"" (C7) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context and its consequences
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
- So the system forces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... indefinitely.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as holding at every moment, this is false: at the times when event1 occurs, event2 does not hold. (Even if event2 recurs infinitely often, it is not true at every instant.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1 → false.
- C4: same as C2 → false.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds."" C2 is false while C6 is true, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 is false now and will never become true because C2 requires C1 (which is never true). Therefore C7 never holds, so C8 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Note the equalities:
   - C3 is the same as C1.
   - C4 is the same as C2.

2. Therefore C5 = C3 or C4 = C1 or C2.

3. C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" = not(C1 or C2) = (not C1) and (not C2).

4. C7 = C2 and C6 = C2 and (not C1) and (not C2). This requires C2 and not C2 simultaneously, a contradiction, so C7 is impossible (always false).

5. C8 states ""C7 eventually holds."" Since C7 can never hold, C8 is false.

So C8 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Identify the goal: C8 says ""C7 eventually holds."" We must decide if that can be true.

2. Examine and simplify the conditions:
- Let P = ""Event2 always happens"" (C1, C3, C4).
- Let Q = ""Event2 happens"" (the plain occurrence).

Then:
- C2 = Q and P.
- C3 = P.
- C4 = Q and P (same as C2).
- C5 = C3 or C4 = P or (Q and P) = P (since P or (P and anything) = P).
- C6 = C5 does not hold = not P.
- C7 = C2 and C6 = (Q and P) and (not P) = Q and (P and not P) = contradiction (always false).

3. Since C7 is logically impossible (it requires P and not P simultaneously), C7 can never hold, so ""eventually C7 holds"" (C8) is false.

Therefore C8 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C9 (""C8 always holds"") is True or False, given the context. Step-by-step:

1) Interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Once event1 has happened, no other events can happen afterward (event1 is terminal).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" only matters if event2 ever occurs.

2) Consequences for event2:
- Because event1 already happened in the initial state and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time (there is no earlier time when event2 could have happened). So any claim ""event2 always happens"" is false.

3) Evaluate the Ci claims under that assignment:
- C1, C2, C5: ""Event2 always happens"" — all false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C2 is false, the implication C3 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" C4 is true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" C1 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" C7 is false (it is a global claim because C1 is global), so C7 is false in the next state as well; hence C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" C8 is false, so C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The question asks whether C9 (""C8 always holds"", i.e. globally X C7) follows from the given context.

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So the state immediately following the initial state has no events (in particular, event2 does not occur there).

- C1 asserts ""Event2 always happens"" (globally). That is impossible in any trace matching the context, because there is a next state with no events, so event2 does not occur there. Therefore C1 is false in every model of the context.

- C7 is C1 AND C6, so C7 is false (because C1 is false).

- C8 says ""C7 holds in the next state"" (X C7). From the initial state we get that X C7 is false (the next state does not satisfy C7).

- C9 requires C8 to hold in every state (G X C7). Since C8 is already false at the initial state, C9 is false.

Thus C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- “After event2, event1 must happen” means whenever event2 occurs, event1 must hold afterward.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means once event1 has happened, no further events occur in any later state. Since event1 holds initially, no events (including event2) can occur at any later time.

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci statements under that interpretation
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” False — event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (so it does not always happen).
- C2 and C5 are the same claim as C1, so they are also false.
- C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” C2 is false, so this implication is vacuously true.
- C4: “C3 holds or event1 happens.” C3 is true (vacuously) and event1 is true initially, so C4 is true.
- C6: “C4 holds or C5 holds.” C4 is true, so C6 is true.
- C7: “C1 holds and C6 holds.” C1 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: “C7 holds in the next state.” C7 is false, so C8 is false.
- C9: “C8 always holds.” C8 is not true, so C9 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 has happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1 and C2) is true at the initial moment.
- C3 is ""event1 happens or C2 holds""; since C2 holds, C3 is true initially.
- C4 = C1 and C3, so C4 is true initially.
- C5 asserts C4 always holds. That fails: after the initial occurrence of event2 there are no further events, so at later moments ""event2 eventually happens"" need not hold, making C1 (and thus C4) false there. So C5 is false.
- C6 is the same as C3 and is true initially.
- C7 = C5 or C6; initially C6 is true, so C7 is true.
- C8 says ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 does hold (at least initially), C8 is false.

Reasoning:

- Initially event2 happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (C1 and C2 are true).
- C3 = (event1 happens) or C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4 = C1 and C3. Both true, so C4 is true.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so the situation that made C1–C4 true persists; therefore C4 holds at all times and C5 is true.
- C6 is the same as C3, so C6 is true.
- C7 = C5 or C6. Since C5 is true, C7 is true.
- C8 asserts ""C7 does not hold"", but C7 does hold, so C8 is false.

- C2: same as C1, True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both true, so C4 is True.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C6 is True.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C7 is true given the context. C7 = (C3 holds) and (C6 holds).

Context summary:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
(Also: after event1, no other events can happen — both events are terminal.)

Step-by-step evaluation of the conditions:

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication and thus holds (it is true whenever evaluated).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is true, so C2 is true (and even vacuously true if event1 never occurs).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" This requires event1 to happen. But the context says event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot happen. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: same as C3, so false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 never holds, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1. What is asked: whether C7 (""C3 holds and C6 holds"") is true given the context.

2. Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 happens initially and after event2 no other events can happen, there are no further states in which event1 could happen.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true in all states, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 does not happen (initial event2 and no further events), so C3 is false.
- C4: same as C3, so false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" There is no future state where C4 can become true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (after initial event2 no events), so the next-state assertion is false.
- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C7 is true.

Step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never happens (neither initially nor later).

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p -> p), so C1 is true.

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true unconditionally, C2 is true.

- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" This requires event1 to happen. But event1 does not occur (event2 happened initially and prevents any further events), so C3 is false.

- C4: same as C3, so false.

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never holds (event1 never happens), so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is false, C6 is false.

- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the event timeline is fixed: event2 occurs first, then event1 must occur, and after event1 nothing else can happen. So there are no ongoing changes that would make truth-values of the Ci's flip later.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P -> P), so C1 is true.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds now (and at every time), it certainly holds at some future time — so C2 is true.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, ""always C3"" is false as well, so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false and, given the fixed timeline and the prior facts, C4 will not become true later, so C5 is false.

7. C6: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds, so C6 is true.

8. C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" That is false because C5 is false (even though C6 is true).

9. C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 is false now and will never become true under the given facts, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P -> P), so C1 is true at every point.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds always, it certainly holds eventually — C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never holds, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Because C5 is false, the conjunction C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" C7 is false and never becomes true, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Timeline forced by the context: event2 occurs, then event1 must occur, and after event1 nothing else can happen. So event1 does occur (and is terminal).

Step 2 — examine each condition and its truth value
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p). It is true at all times.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds always, C1 certainly holds at some point, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 is true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false and C6 is true, so the conjunction C7 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C7 (""Event1 happens or C6 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we conclude event1 will (indeed must) happen at some point after that initial event2.

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Because C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event1 does happen, the conjunction fails).
- C3 and C4: both state ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false and there is no way for C1 to become true (it denies an event that already occurred), C2 never holds, so C3 and C4 are false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is false, the implication C3 → C4 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Because C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" We already established event1 does happen (from the initial event2), so the disjunction is true regardless of C6.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must determine whether C7 (""Event1 happens or C6 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen.
=> Thus Event2 occurs (initially) and forces Event1 to occur afterward, which forces Event2 again, and so on. In particular, Event1 does occur and Event2 does occur.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (Event2 does happen).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false and cannot become true, so C3 is false.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true (vacuously).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" Event1 does happen (from the context), so C7 is true regardless of C6.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context the events alternate starting with event1 at state 0: event1 at even states, event2 at odd states.
- C1: ""event1 or event1"" ≡ event1. So C1 holds exactly at even states.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ event1 holds at n+1, so C2 holds exactly at odd states.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" would require event1 at the current state (even) and C2 true (odd) simultaneously — impossible. So C3 is false at every state.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" is therefore true at every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" is true at every state (since C4 is true everywhere).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" is true (C5 is true at every state).
- C7: ""event1 or C6"" is true everywhere (C6 is true).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" is false everywhere.
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" is therefore false everywhere.

Thus C9 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context the events strictly alternate starting with event1 at time 0: times 0,2,4,...: event1 true; times 1,3,5,...: event1 false (event2 true).
- C1 is just ""event1"" (event1 or event1).
- C2 at time t is event1 at time t+1.
- C3 at time t is (event1 at t+1) and (event1 at t).
- C4 = not C3 = not(event1_t and event1_{t+1}), so C4_t is true whenever you do not have event1 at both t and t+1.
- Because event1 never occurs two steps in a row, C4_t is true for every t.
- Hence C5_t = C4_{t+1} is true for every t, so C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true at every time.
- At time 1 (the ""next state"" from the initial time) event1 is false but C6 is true, so C7 = (event1 or C6) is true; therefore C8 = not C7 is false at time 1.
- C9 asks that C8 holds in the next state (i.e., at time 1). But C8 is false at time 1, so C9 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the events alternate starting with event1 at time 0:
   t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ...

2. Simplify and evaluate each condition at t0 (current state) using that timeline.

3. C1 = ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1. At t0 this is true.

4. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" → at t1 C1 must hold. But at t1 event2 happens, so C1 is false at t1. Thus C2 is false at t0.

5. C3 = ""C2 holds and event1 happens"": C2 is false at t0, so C3 is false.

6. C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" → true (since C3 is false).

7. C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"": C4 is true at t1 as well (see below), so C5 is true at t0. (More generally C4 will be true at every time because C3 is always false—see step 9.)

8. C6 = ""C5 always holds"": since, as shown below, C3 is never true (events never make event1 at two consecutive times), C4 is always true, hence C5 is true at every time, so C6 is true.

9. C7 = ""event1 happens or C6 holds"": C6 holds, so C7 is true.

10. C8 = ""C7 does not hold"": false.

11. C9 = ""C8 holds in the next state"": at t1 C8 is false, so C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify what C9 means.

Simplify the conditions:
- C6 = event1 ∨ next(C4).
- C7 = C6 ∧ event1 = event1 (because event1 ∧ (event1 ∨ X) is just event1).
- C8 = C1 ∧ C7 = (C1) ∧ event1.
- C9 = event1 ∨ C8. But C8 already includes event1, so C9 is equivalent to event1 happening.

From the context: initially event2 happened, and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Since event2 did happen initially, event1 must happen (at some point after the initial state). The constraint ""after event1, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Therefore C9 (which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The question asks whether C9 (""Event1 happens or C8 holds"") is true given the context.
- From the context: event2 happens initially, and after event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (at the state following the initial one).
- Given event1 happens:
  - C6 = (event1) or C5 is true (because event1 is true).
  - C7 = C6 and event1 is true.
  - C1 (and likewise C2, C3) assert ""if event1 happens then event2 happens."" Since event2 already happened earlier in the timeline, that implication is satisfied whenever event1 occurs, so C1 is true.
  - Hence C8 = C1 and C7 is true.
- Therefore C9 = (event1) or C8 is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).

So C9 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C7 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else can happen. So event1 did happen and event2 will (and does) happen.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): True, because event1 happened and that forces event2.
- C2, C3, C5 (each ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens""): True — event1 already happened, so the implication is satisfied.
- C4 (""C2 or C3""): True (both C2 and C3 are true).
- C6 (""C4 and C5""): True (both conjuncts are true).
- C7 (""C6 always holds""): True, because C6 is true given the fixed facts above and no further events can change those facts.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 does occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so the only events that occur are event1 then event2.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the context (event1 happened initially and event2 must follow), event2 does occur in every execution, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 does hold and event1 does happen (it happened initially), so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" At least one (in fact both) hold, so C4 is true.
- C5: same implication as C2/C3, so true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since the context fixes the sequence (event1 then event2, no alternatives), C6 is true in every execution, so C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False.

Context facts:
- event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does happen in this run).
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (irrelevant for the later logical form because it appears only in antecedents)
- C2, C3, C5: each says ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" All three are the same conditional.
- C4: C2 or C3 — which is just that conditional (a disjunction of two identical formulas).
- C6: C4 and C5 — conjunction of the same conditional with itself, so equivalent to the same conditional: (If C1 then event1).

Now truth values:
- event1 is true in the context. A conditional ""If C1 then event1"" is true whenever its consequent (event1) is true, regardless of whether C1 holds. Therefore C2, C3, and C5 are true in this situation.
- Hence C4 and C6 are true.
- C7 asserts that C6 always holds. Since C6 is true given the facts (and nothing in the context makes it fail at any point), C7 is true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C7 says ""C6 eventually holds."" So the question is: given the context, does C6 become true at some point?

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A) and therefore true in any trace.
- C2: same as C1, also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 (and C2) are true, C3 is true.
- C4: identical to C3, so C4 is also true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But we just established C4 does hold, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" That requires both true and false, so C6 is false (cannot hold).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" If C6 is false and cannot become true (it's a contradiction of statements already fixed as true/false), then C6 never becomes true, so C7 is false.

Step 3 — consider context (events)
- The context about event1 and event2 does not change the logical status of the tautological implications C1/C2 or the contradiction between C4 and C5, so the above truth values stand.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C7 says ""C6 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the timeline C6 is true).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happens, and after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 nothing else can happen. So event2 will occur at some point.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is true (a tautological implication).
- C2: same as C1, so true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 does hold, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" Since C3 is true but C5 is false, C6 is false. Moreover C6 is logically inconsistent (it requires (C1 or C2) and not(C1 or C2)), so it cannot become true at any time.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is impossible/always false, C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C7 states ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — interpret the context (events):
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen → timeline: event1 then event2, then stop.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P) and is True.
- C2: same as C1, also True.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 is True, C3 is True.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 does hold, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" That is True AND False → False.

Step 4 — C7: ""C6 eventually holds.""
C6 is False now and, given the logical nature of C1–C5 (tautologies and their negation), C5 will remain False and C6 will never become True. Therefore C6 does not eventually hold, so C7 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context gives a single actual event: event1 happens initially, and both event1 and event2 are terminal (after either of them no further events can occur). So there is no future state in which event1 or event2 occurs again.

- C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true in the initial state (because event1 happened).

- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false: in the next state there are no events, so neither event1 nor event2 occurs, hence C1 is false there. (If one treats ""next"" as nonexistent, the usual semantics also makes Xφ false.)

- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is false.

- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false because C3 is false now.

- C5 and C6 (next/always variants of C4) are therefore false.

- C7 (""If C2 holds then C6 holds""): since C2 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C7 holds.

- C8 states ""C7 does not hold"" — but C7 does hold, so C8 is false.

Thus C8 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system starts in a state where event1 has occurred and there is no later state with any event.

- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True in the initial state (event1 happened).

- C2/C3: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state with any event (after event1 nothing happens), so C1 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C2 and C3 are false.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False, because C3 is false in the (immediate) next state.

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False (C4 is already false).

- C6: ""C5 always holds."" False.

- C7: ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" This implication is true because C2 is false (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 is true, C8 is false.

Goal: decide whether C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is True or False.

Setup (semantics used): we are at the initial state where event1 has happened. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means there are no future occurrences of any events (in particular event2 never occurs in the future). ""Eventually"" means ""true at some future state (including possibly the next)"". ""Holds"" means true at the current state.

Step-by-step:

1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since no events can occur after event1, event2 will never happen in the future. So C1 is false.

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is false now and will never become true (no future events), so C2 is false.

3. C3: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.

4. C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C4 is false.

5. C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Because event2 never happens, the implication is vacuously true (an implication with false antecedent is true). Thus C5 is true.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is false and will never become true, so C7 is false.

8. C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" Same reasoning, C8 is false.

9. C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" C8 is false now and remains false in the next state, so C9 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So no future events (including event2) can occur.
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false (event2 cannot happen).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false (C1 is false and will remain false).
- C3 is the same as C1, so false.
- C4 (C2 and C3) is false.
- C5 (""if event2 happens, then C4 holds""): since event2 never happens, the implication is vacuously true. So C5 is true.
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false.
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false (C6 is false and stays false).
- C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is false.
- C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 holds initially, and ""after event1 no other events can happen."" So once event1 holds (already at the initial state), event2 can never occur at any future state.
- C1 (event2 eventually happens): false (event2 never occurs).
- C2 (C1 eventually holds): false (C1 is false at every state).
- C3 (event2 eventually happens): same as C1, false.
- C4 (C2 and C3): false.
- C5 (if event2 then C4): true — an implication with a false antecedent (event2 never holds) is vacuously true.
- C6 (C5 does not hold): false.
- C7 (C6 eventually holds): false.
- C8 (C7 eventually holds): false.
- C9 (C8 holds in the next state): false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the background
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in every continuation/event sequence consistent with the background, event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the actual sequences are: event1 then event2, and then stop).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 did happen initially and the background requires event2 after event1, event2 does indeed occur in all allowed continuations. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 happened initially and C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" Event1 does happen, and C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Same as C3, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 and C5 are both true, so C6 is true.

Step 3 — is C6 always true (C7)?
- Because the background fixes that event1 happened initially in every allowed continuation, C4 and C5 are equivalent to the same true facts in every continuation (they hold in all continuations). Thus the implication in C6 holds in every continuation — C6 is always true.

Final answer:
True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): True, because the context guarantees event2 occurs.
- C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds""): True (both disjuncts are true).
- C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds""): True (event1 happened and C2 is true).
- C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds""): True (antecedent event1 holds and consequent C3 holds).
- C5 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds""): True (same as C3).
- C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds""): True (C4 and C5 both hold).
- C7 (""C6 always holds""): True, since C6 is true in the given scenario.

Thus C7 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: s0 (initial) has event1. Rules: after event1 → event2 in next state; after event2 → event1 in next state. So states alternate: s0:event1, s1:event2, s2:event1, ...
- Evaluate at s0:
  - C1/C2 (""Event2 always happens""): false (s0 has event1, not event2).
  - C3 (""C2 always holds""): false (C2 is false).
  - C4 (""C3 does not hold""): true.
  - C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens""): false at s0 because event2 does not happen at s0.

  - C7 (""If event1 then C6""): true at s0 (event1 holds and C6 holds).
  - C8 (""C7 does not hold""): false at s0.
- C9 asserts ""C8 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C8 true in s1). In s1: event2 happens, so
  - C7 (""If event1 then C6"") is vacuously true (event1 does not hold in s1), hence C8 is false in s1.
- Therefore C9 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 is the initial event, no other events (including event2) can occur afterwards (and there is no earlier time for event2 in the given timeline). So event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (from the context).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (because C1 is true).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" — True: the implication is vacuously true because event2 does not happen.
- C4: same as C3 — True.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" — True (because C4 holds).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" — False (because C5 is true).
- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" — C3 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We are asked whether C7 (the conjunction ""C3 holds and C6 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Use the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- The context states: after event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can happen. Therefore: event2 does not happen.

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (from the context).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (it negates the true C1).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" — An implication with a false antecedent (event2 does not happen) is vacuously true. So C3 is True.
- C4: same as C3 — True.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" — C4 is True, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" — False (it negates the true C5).
- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" — C3 is True but C6 is False, so the conjunction is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur afterward. Therefore event2 does not happen.

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (from Step 1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (C1 holds).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" True (implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true because event2 does not happen).
- C4: same as C3, so True.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" True (C4 holds).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False (C5 holds).

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur later), and once event1 happens nothing else can happen.

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 did happen initially.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already false (at the initial state), C2 is false.

4. C3 and C4: Both are ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Because C2 is false, C3 and C4 are false (even though event1 does happen later, the conjunction with false C2 makes them false).

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false in all states (it requires C2), so C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C3 holds or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.

7. C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
We are asked whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So event2 did occur (initially), then event1 occurs, and then no further events occur.

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 did happen initially).

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

- C3 and C4: Both are ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Because C2 is false, C3 and C4 are false (even though event1 does happen).

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false in every state (because C2 is false), so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C3 holds or C5 holds."" Both are false, so C6 is false.

- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Final answer: True

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Let s0 be the initial state. By the context, event2 happened in s0.
- Because ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state s1 has event1. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen"", s1 is terminal (no further states).
- Evaluate the conditions at s0:
  - C1 (""event2 does not happen""): false at s0 (event2 did happen there).
  - C2 (""C1 always holds""): false at s0 because C1 is false at s0.
  - C3 and C4 (""C2 holds and event1 happens""): false at s0 (C2 is false at s0).
  - C5 (""C4 holds in the next state""): check s1 — at s1, C1 is true (no event2 occurs from s1 onward), so C2 is true at s1, and event1 happens at s1, so C4 is true at s1. Hence C5 is true at s0.
  - C6 (""C3 holds or C5 holds""): true at s0 because C5 is true.
  - C7 (""C6 does not hold""): false at s0 because C6 does hold.

Answer: False

Reasoning step by step

1. Interpret the context
- At time 0 (initially) event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, there will be no further events in any later state. So no future event2 can occur.
- (The clause ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 will never occur given the previous line.)

2. Evaluate the conditions
- C1 (event2 eventually happens): False, because after the initial event1 no further events (including event2) can occur.
- C2 (C1 holds or event2 happens now): False OR (event2 now). At the initial state event2 does not hold now, so C2 is False.
- C3 (C2 does not hold): True (since C2 is False).
- C4 (C3 always holds): True — C3 is true now and there are no events to change that, so it stays true forever.
- C5 (C4 does not hold): False (since C4 is True).
- C6 (C5 holds in the next state): False (C5 is false now and remains false in all future states).
- C7 (same as C2): False.
- C8 (C6 and C7): False AND False = False.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Reasoning (concise, non-hidden):

- From the context: event1 occurs initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never happens at any time.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (event2 eventually happens): False.
- C2 (C1 holds or event2 happens): False.
- C3 (C2 does not hold): True.
- C4 (C3 always holds): True (C2 is false at every state, so C3 is always true).
- C5 (C4 does not hold): False.
- C6 (C5 holds in the next state): False (C5 is false in every state).
- C7 (C1 holds or event2 happens): False (same as C2).
- C8 (C6 holds and C7 holds): False (both conjuncts are false).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C8 (C6 AND C7) is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context to constrain traces
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no future state can contain any event (including event2). Thus event2 never happens in any future state.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C2 can never become true (event2 never happens), C3 is true in all states, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False (C5 is false now and remains false).
- C7: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Same as C2, so False.

---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let S0 be the initial state, S1 the next state, etc. From the context: event1 occurs at S0, and after event1 (so at S1 and later) no events occur. Hence event2 never occurs at any state.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
  - At S0 this is false (event1 true, event2 false).
  - At S1 and later this is true vacuously (event1 is false there).

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At S0 this asks whether C1 holds at S1. C1 does hold at S1, so C2 is true at S0.

- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" At S0, C2 is true, so C3 is true at S0.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Check S1: as above, C2 holds at S1 (because C1 holds at S2 vacuously), so C3 holds at S1. Thus C4 is true at S0.

- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" At S0 event1 is true and C4 is true, so C5 holds at S0.

- C6: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the same as C2 and is true at S0.

- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" At S0 at least one (indeed both) holds, so C7 holds at S0.

- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" Since C7 holds already at S0, C8 is true.

Therefore C8 is True.

Step 1 — What is asked
- Determine whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") can be true given the context rules about events.

Step 2 — Context summary
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state s0, event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so in every state following any state where event1 occurred, no events occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (but this is irrelevant if event2 can never occur).

Step 3 — Interpret the hypothesis (flattened)
- C1: event1 does not happen (holds at whatever state is meant).
- C2 / C3: C1 holds in the next state (so in the next state event1 does not happen).
- C4: C3 holds AND event2 happens (so requires event2 to happen in that state while the next state has no event1).
- C5: C4 always holds (C4 true at every state).
- C6: C5 holds in the next state.
- C7: C2 holds AND C6 holds.
- C8: C7 always holds.

Step 4 — Reasoning with the context
- At s0, event1 happened (given). Therefore any state after s0 (s1, s2, ...) must have no events (by ""after event1, no other events can happen""). In particular, event2 can never occur at any later state.
- C2/C3 (C1 holds in the next state) can be true at s0, because s1 has no event1.
- But C4 requires event2 to happen in some state while also C3 holds there. Since event2 is impossible after s0 (and doesn't happen at s0 because event1 happened there), C4 can never be true at any state.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false (C4 is never true).
- Then C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false; C7 (C2 AND C6) is false wherever C6 is false; hence C7 is false at every state.
- Therefore C8 (""C7 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False

We want to know whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is true given the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Interpret the timeline as states s0 (initial), s1, s2, ...; event1 holds at s0 and no events occur at any later state.

Step-by-step evaluation at the initial state s0:

1. C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""  
   - At s0 event1 did happen, so C1 is false at s0.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""  
   - At s1 no events occur (because after event1 no events can happen), so event1 does not happen at s1. Thus C1 is true at s1, so C2 is true at s0.

3. C3: same as C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""), so C3 is also true at s0.

4. C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens.""  
   - Although C3 holds at s0, event2 does not happen (no events after s0), so C4 is false at s0.

5. C5: ""C4 always holds.""  
   - Because C4 is false at s0, C5 is false (it is not true at all states).

6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state.""  
   - C5 is false everywhere, so C6 is false at s0.

7. C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds.""  
   - C2 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false at s0.

8. C8: ""C7 always holds.""  
   - Since C7 is already false at s0, C8 is false.

Conclusion: C8 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- From the context, event1 happens (initially) and event2 happens afterward. So ""event1 does not happen"" is false.
- C1 = false. C2 = false.
- C3 = C1 and C2 = false.
- C4 = (if C3 then event1). Since C3 is false, C4 is vacuously true.
- C5 = (C4 or event2). C4 is true (and event2 also happens), so C5 is true.
- C6 = C1 and C2 = false.
- C7 = (if C5 then C6). Antecedent C5 is true but consequent C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Goal: determine whether C7 is True or False given the context.

Context facts:
- event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 happens).
- After event2 no other events can happen.

Evaluate each condition:

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (event1 did happen).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" false ∧ false = false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true → C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" C4 is true (and event2 also happens), so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" same as C3, so false.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" C5 is true but C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False

Identify the question: we must determine the truth value of C7 given the context and the listed conditions.

From the context:
- event1 happens (initially).
- event2 happens after event1 (so event2 happens).
- no events after event2.

Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False (event1 does happen).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: C1 and C2 — False and False = False.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" — antecedent C3 is False, so the implication is vacuously True.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" — C4 is True (and event2 also happens), so C5 is True.
- C6: C1 and C2 — still False.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" — antecedent C5 is True, consequent C6 is False, so the implication is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step summary):

- By the context, event1 happens in the initial state (so ""event1"" is true initially).
- C8 is ""event1 happens or C7 holds."" Since event1 is true initially, C8 is true in the initial state regardless of C7.
- C9 is ""C8 does not hold"" (the negation of C8). Because C8 holds, C9 is false.
---
Reasoning:

- From the context, event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So we have an initial state where event1 holds, and all future states are unchanged (no event2 can occur).

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (true in every state). So C1 holds in the initial state and in every future state.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now (and in every state), C2 is true (whether ""eventually"" allows the current state or not, C1 also holds in all future states).

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C2 holds now and in all future states, so C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 holds in every state, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is true in every state, it holds in the next state, so C5 is true.

- C6 and C7: ""Eventually C5"" and ""Eventually C6"" follow the same pattern and are true.

- C8: ""Event1 happens or C7 holds."" Event1 happens in the initial state, so C8 is true there.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" This contradicts the fact that C8 does hold (because event1 happened). Therefore C9 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step-by-step:

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p -> p), so C1 is true in every state.

2. C2 = Eventually C1. Because C1 holds now (indeed in every state), C2 is true (it already holds).

3. C3 = Eventually C2. Since C2 holds now, C3 is true.

4. C4 = Always C3. C3 holds in the current state and, because C1 (hence C2 and C3) hold in every state, C3 holds in all states. So C4 is true.

5. C5 = Next C4. Because C4 is true in every state, it is true in the next state as well (if a next state exists). Thus C5 holds.

6. C6 = Eventually C5. Since C5 holds now, C6 holds.

7. C7 = Eventually C6. Since C6 holds now, C7 holds.

8. C8 = Event1 happens or C7 holds. The context states event1 happened initially, so the disjunction is true (C8 holds).

9. C9 = C8 does not hold. Since C8 does hold, C9 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is the last event).

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci formulas
- C1, C2, C5, C8: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". By the context, event2 does happen, so C1, C2, C5, C8 are true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 did happen and C2 is true, so C3 is true.

- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Moving to the next state (after the initial one) does not invalidate the fact that event2 will happen later, so C5 (hence C6) remains true there. Therefore C7 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 occurs (at time 0).
- After event2, event1 must occur (so event1 occurs at some later time).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, no further events occur).

So a valid timeline is: time 0: event2; later: event1; after that: nothing.

Step 2 — evaluate each claim
- C1 (Event2 always happens): False — event2 occurs at time 0 but not after event1, so it is not true at all times.
- C2 (same as C1): False.
- C3 (C2 eventually holds): False — C2 (that event2 always holds) never becomes true at any future point.
- C4 (If C1 then C3): True — the implication is vacuously true because C1 is false.
- C5 (Event1 happens or C4 holds): True — event1 does happen (and C4 is also true).
- C6 (C2 eventually holds): False (same as C3).
- C7 (If C5 holds, then C6 holds): False — C5 is true but C6 is false, so the implication is false.
- C8 (C7 always holds): False — C7 is false, so it cannot be always true.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: event2 happens initially, then event1 must happen, and after event1 no further events can occur. So the sequence is: event2 (t0), event1 (t1), then nothing.
- C1 and C2 (""Event2 always happens"") are false: event2 does not happen after event1, so it is not true ""always"".
- C3 and C6 (""C2 eventually holds"") are false: C2 (Event2 always happens) never becomes true at any future time.
- C4 (""If C1 then C3"") is vacuously true because C1 is false.
- C5 (""Event1 happens or C4"") is true because event1 does happen.
- C7 (""If C5 then C6"") is false because C5 is true but C6 is false.
- Therefore C8 (""C7 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
The question: is C9 true or false?

Step 1 — the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions (treating ""If ... then ..."" as material implication)
- C1: (event2 → event2). A tautology, true.
- C2: same as C1, true.
- C3: same as C1, true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: (C2 → C4). C2 is true, but C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: (C1 → C5). C1 is true, C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: (event2 → C6). Antecedent event2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" Given C7 is true here, C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" C8 is true but event2 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Conclusion: C9 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C9 (""C8 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context about events
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
=> Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition under that reality
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This conditional is a tautology (true).
- C2: same as C1, true.
- C3: same as C1, true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" C2 holds, but C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds."" C1 holds, but C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C6 holds."" Event2 does not happen, so this implication is vacuously true (true).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 holds, so C8 holds (true).
- C9: ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" Although C8 holds, event2 does not happen, so C9 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C9 (""C8 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — context about events
""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur. Therefore event2 does not happen.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1, C2, C3: each is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — these are tautological implications (p → p), so C1, C2, C3 are true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 does hold, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" C2 holds, but C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds."" C1 holds, but C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C6 holds."" Since event2 does not happen, this implication is vacuously true, so C7 holds.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" Given C7 holds, C8 holds.
- C9: ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" C8 holds but event2 does not happen, so C9 is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step by step):

1. Interpret the context as a sequence of states:
   - s0 (initial): event1 happens.
   - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" ⇒ s1: event2 happens.
   - ""After event2, no other events can happen"" ⇒ s2, s3, ...: neither event1 nor event2 happens.

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1 = (event1 ∨ event2).
   - C2 = (event1 ∨ event2) (same as C1).
   - C3 = (event1 ∨ C2) = (event1 ∨ event2) (same).
   - C4 = Next(C3).
   - C5 = Always(C4) = Always(Next(C3)) — i.e. at every state, the next state has event1 or event2.
   - C6 = C1 ∧ C5.
   - C7 = ¬C6.
   - C8 = Next(C7).
   - C9 = Eventually(C8).

3. Evaluate these on the concrete trace:
   - s0: event1 true ⇒ C1 true at s0.
   - s1: event2 true ⇒ C1 true at s1.
   - s2 onward: neither event holds ⇒ C1 false at s2+.
   - Check C5 (Always Next(C3)): at s1 the next state is s2, but s2 has neither event so C3 is false at s2. Hence Next(C3) is false at s1, so C5 (Always Next(C3)) is false overall.
   - Therefore C6 = C1 ∧ C5 is false (at every state, because C5 fails globally).
   - Thus C7 = ¬C6 is true (at every state).
   - C8 = Next(C7): at s0, Next(C7) is true because C7 holds at s1. So C8 holds at s0 (and in fact at every state whose successor exists).
   - C9 = Eventually(C8) is true because C8 already holds at s0 (so it holds at some state).

So C9 evaluates to True.

Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 has already happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system is in a terminal state after that event).
- If event1 were to happen, event2 must happen afterwards — but event1 cannot occur after event2 because no events can happen after event2.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True — in every (only) reachable state C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" True, because C2 holds.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" True (C3 holds in the only state).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False (C5 does hold).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" False — C6 is false now and no future states will make it true.
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" False for the same reason.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" False.

False

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the context:
   - In the initial state S0, event2 happened (so ""event2"" is true at S0).
   - After event2 (i.e. in the next states), no events occur — so in S1 (and any later states) neither event1 nor event2 holds.
   - The same “no further events” fact for event1 only matters if event1 had happened; it did not here.

2. Evaluate the named conditions at the initial state S0:
   - C1 = (event2 or event1). At S0 this is True (event2 happened).
   - C2 = “C1 holds in the next state” = C1 at S1. At S1 neither event occurs, so C1 at S1 is False. Thus C2 is False at S0.
   - C3 = same as C2, so False.
   - C4 = (event2 or event1) = same as C1, True at S0.
   - C5 = C3 and C4 = False and True = False.
   - C6 = C2 and C5 = False and False = False.
   - C7 = “C6 holds in the next state” = C6 at S1. As above, at S1 none of the event-based conditions hold, so C6 at S1 is False; thus C7 is False at S0.
   - C8 = “C7 does not hold” = not C7. Since C7 is False, C8 is True.

Therefore C8 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no further events can happen.
- C1 = (event2 or event1). At the initial state C1 is true (event2 happened).
- C2 and C3 assert that C1 holds in the next state. In the next state no events occur, so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 is the same as C1 at the initial state, so C4 is true.
- C5 = C3 and C4. Since C3 is false, C5 is false.
- C6 = C2 and C5. Since C2 (and C5) are false, C6 is false.
- C7 asserts C6 holds in the next state. C6 is false in every future state (no events ever happen after event2), so C7 is false.
- C8 = (not C7). Since C7 is false, C8 is true.
---
True

Reasoning summary:
- At the initial state: event2 happened, so C1 (event2 or event1) is True and C4 (same) is True.
- After event2, no further events can occur, so in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds. Therefore C1 in the next state is False, so C2 and C3 (both ""C1 holds in the next state"") are False.
- C5 = C3 and C4 → False (because C3 is False).
- C6 = C2 and C5 → False.
- C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" → False (since C6 is False in the next state as well).
- C8 = ""C7 does not hold"" → True."

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: at the initial state event1 happens and there are no successor states (after event1 no other events can happen). So we have a one-state trace where event1 is true at that state and no next state exists.

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state (and using the standard temporal semantics where X φ is false at a state with no successor, and F φ is true iff φ holds at some state now or in the future):

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False (event1 does happen initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1). False (there is no next state).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" At the initial state event1 is true but C2 is false, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3). False (C3 is false now and there is no future state).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" True (C4 is false).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). False (no next state).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" (F C6). False (C6 is never true).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" True (C7 is false).

3. C9: ""If event1 happens, then C8 holds."" At the initial state event1 is true and C8 is true, so the implication is true.

Therefore C9 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: initially event1 has occurred. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event2) can occur in any future state after that initial state.
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false because no events can occur after event1.
- C2 and C3 (""C1 holds in the next state"") are false — they assert C1 at a future state, but C1 is false (and no events can appear later).
- C4 (C2 and C3) is false because both conjuncts are false.
- C5 (C4 and event2 happens) is false (C4 false and event2 never happens).
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false because C5 never becomes true.
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false because C6 is false.
- C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is false because C7 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
The hypothesis asks whether C8 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the context and its consequences
- Initially, event1 happened (so the initial state has event1).
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” That makes any state following an event1 state have no events; in particular, once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur at any later state.
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” This rule is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.

Since event1 already happened initially and event1 forbids any later events, event2 cannot occur in any future state.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Since no events can happen after the initial event1, C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That requires C1 to be true at the next state; but at the next state no events can occur, so C1 is false there as well, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, false.
- C4: C2 and C3 — false.
- C5: C4 and event2 — false (event2 never happens).
- C6: “C5 eventually holds.” Since C5 never holds, C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 always holds.” C6 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: “C7 holds in the next state.” Since C7 is false, C8 is false.

Final answer
False

Hypothesis: C8 is True or False?

Step 1 — interpret the context
- At the initial state s0, event1 has happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means there are no successor states after s0 (no next state).
- Therefore any ""next"" (X) formula at s0 is false (since there is no next state).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at s0
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" There is no next state → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C1). No next state → C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1 (or again X C1) → false.
- C4: C2 and C3 → false ∧ false = false.
- C5: C4 and event2 happens → false (and event2 does not happen in s0) = false.
- C6: ""Eventually C5"" (F C5). Since there are no future states and C5 is false now, F C5 is false.
- C7: ""Always C6"" (G C6). C6 is false at s0, so G C6 is false.
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" (X C7). No next state → C8 is false.

Conclusion: C8 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 occurs (so at time 0 event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must occur (so sometime after time 0, event2 will occur).
- After event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: after it there are states with no events).

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" temporally (holds at every time point in the run), C1 is false: after event2 (which must occur) there are later times with no events, so event1 does not hold at those times.

Step 3 — propagate falsity through the composite conditions
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — false because C1 is false.
- C3 is the same as C1 — false.
- C4 is ""C2 or C3"" — false (both disjuncts false).
- C5 is same as C1 — false.
- C6 is ""C4 and C5"" — false.
- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds"" — false (C6 is never true).

Final answer: False

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1. What is being asked: C7 says ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide whether there is any possible future point in the system where C6 is true, given the context.

2. Interpret the context and the Ci statements:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen. Thus the timeline is: event1 occurs initially, then (necessarily) event2 occurs later, and once event2 has occurred nothing else can occur afterwards.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — i.e. event1 holds at every time point (the global/always property).
- C2, C3, C5: each asserts ""C1 always holds"" (same as C1 being globally true).
- C4: C2 or C3 (disjunction of two identical false claims).
- C6: C4 and C5 (conjunction).
- C7: Eventually C6 holds.

3. Evaluate C1: Because event1 occurs only initially and is not required to hold at all later times (indeed event2 will occur and then no events occur), ""event1 always happens"" is false. There is no timepoint at which the claim ""event1 holds at all timepoints"" becomes true.

4. Propagate truth values:
- Since C1 is false, C2, C3, and C5 (which assert C1 always holds) are false.
- C4 = C2 or C3 is false.
- C6 = C4 and C5 is false.

5. C7 (""eventually C6""): C6 is never true at any timepoint, so it cannot become true in the future. Therefore C7 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Let p = ""event2 happens (at the current moment)"" and q = ""event1 happens (at the current moment)"".  
- From the context the system alternates: t0: p true, q false; t1: q true, p false; t2: p true, ... So p and q never hold simultaneously at the same time point.

Now evaluate the Ci in temporal (per-state) semantics:

- C1 = p ∧ q. This is false at every time (they never coincide), so C1 is false.
- C2 = eventually C1. If C1 is false at every time, ""eventually C1"" is false.
- C3 = always C2. Since C2 is false (not true at any time), ""always C2"" is false.
- C4 = p ∧ q, same as C1, false.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4, false ∧ false = false.
- C6 = eventually C5, false.
- C7 = eventually C6, false.
- C8 = always C7, false.
- C9 = eventually C8, false.

Therefore C9 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked:
C7 is the statement ""C6 holds or event2 happens."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — use the context:
Initially event1 happened. The context also says “after event1, event2 must happen.” Since event1 did happen initially, event2 must (and therefore does) happen next.

Step 3 — evaluate C7:
A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. We have directly that event2 happens, so the second disjunct is true. Therefore C7 is true (regardless of whether C6 holds).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Since event1 happened initially, event2 will happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so the two events alternate indefinitely. Crucially, event2 does indeed happen (at least once, and indeed repeatedly).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false: there are times when event2 occurs instead of event1.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication P -> P is a tautology, so C4 is true (true regardless of whether C2/C3 are true).
- C5: ""C1 always holds."" Again false.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 is true and C5 is false, so the implication is false; hence C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds or event2 happens."" C6 is false, but event2 does happen (from the context). Therefore the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine C7:
- C7 says: ""C6 holds or event2 happens"" (i.e., C6 ∨ event2).

Step 3 — use the context to check event2:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The context rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies that, following that initial event1, event2 will happen (at least once).
- Therefore event2 does happen.

Step 4 — conclude C7:
- Since event2 happens, the disjunction C6 ∨ event2 is true regardless of C6's value.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context we get the timeline: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So the events alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... .

2. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") — interpreted naturally as ""event2 occurs at every time point"" — is false, because at the times when event1 occurs, event2 does not occur.

3. From C1 = False:
   - C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
   - C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is False.
   - C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is true (vacuously, since C3 is false).
   - C5 (""C1 does not hold"") is True (same as C2).
   - C6 (C4 or C5) is True (because C5 is True).
   - C7 (""Event2 always happens"") is the same as C1 and thus False.
   - C8 (C6 and C7) = True and False = False.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 occurs initially, and the rules force alternation (after event2 → event1, after event1 → event2). So event1 does occur at some point, and event2 recurs, but event2 does not hold at every moment (there are moments when event1 is happening). Thus ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is not true.

- C1 is false, so:
  - C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
  - C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false (negation of true).
  - C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is true (implication with false antecedent is vacuously true).
  - C5 (""C1 does not hold"") is true (same as C2).
  - C6 (""C4 or C5"") is true (C5 is true).
  - C7 (""Event2 always happens"") is the same as C1, so C7 is false.

- C8 is ""C6 and C7"". Since C7 is false, C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Goal: determine whether C8 (""C6 holds and C7 holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — use the context to evaluate event facts
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So the events alternate (event2, event1, event2, ...). Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" (meaning at every step) is false, because there are steps where event1 happens instead.

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci statements
- C1: Event2 always happens. From above, C1 is False.
- C2: C1 does not hold. So C2 is True.
- C3: C2 does not hold. Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: If C3 holds, then event1 happens. The antecedent C3 is False, so the implication is vacuously True. Thus C4 is True.
- C5: C1 does not hold. This is the same as C2, so C5 is True.
- C6: C4 holds or C5 holds. Both are True, so C6 is True.
- C7: Event2 always happens. Same as C1, so C7 is False.

Step 3 — evaluate C8
- C8 is ""C6 holds and C7 holds"". That is True AND False, which is False.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen (and they must alternate). So event1 does happen at some point. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") and C2 are false.
- C3 (""Event2 happens and C2 holds"") is false because C2 is false.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false, so C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false.
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true. Hence C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true (it already holds).
- C8 (""C1 holds and C7 holds"") is false because C1 is false.
- C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is therefore false.

Thus C9 is False.

Step 1 — what is asked:
C6 = (C4 holds) AND (C5 holds). Since C4 and C5 are identical (""C3 does not hold""), C6 is true exactly when C3 is false.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at time 1).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at time 2, C1 holds).
- C4/C5: ""C3 does not hold.""

Step 3 — use the context:
""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen."" Because event1 happens initially and no events can happen afterwards, no event (neither event1 nor event2) can occur at time 1 or time 2.

Step 4 — evaluate:
- At time 0: C1 is true (event1 happened).
- At time 1: no events occur → C1 is false at time 1 → C2 (C1 at time 1) is false at time 0.
- At time 2: no events occur → C1 is false at time 2 → C3 (C2 at time 1, i.e. C1 at time 2) is false at time 0.
- Therefore C3 does not hold (C4 and C5 true).
- Thus C6 = C4 AND C5 is true.

Final answer: True

Let's evaluate step by step.

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So at the initial state:
   - C1 (""event1 or event2 happens"") is true (event1 happened).

2. C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C1). But there is no further event after event1 (no successor where an event occurs). Whether because there is no next state or because in any next state neither event1 nor event2 happens, C2 is false.

3. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). Since C2 is already false at the immediate next point (or there is no next state), C3 is false.

4. C4 and C5 both assert ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 and C5 are true.

5. C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
- We must decide whether C6 (C4 holds and C5 holds) is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (so there is no successor state with any event after the initial state). (Similarly after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 never occurs here.)
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" In the initial state event1 happens, so C1 is true initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial one (no other events can happen), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since there is no next state to begin with, C2 does not hold in any next state, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 does not hold."" Same as C4, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 is true given the context and the chains of conditions. C7 is ""C2 holds and C6 holds.""

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" — so the events alternate across successive states: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, ...
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Treated as a global property.)
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (checked in the current state).
- C3, C4: same as C2 (redundant).
- C5: C3 or C4 (so C5 is true exactly when C3 (i.e. C1 & event1) is true).
- C6: C5 holds in the next state.
- C7: C2 holds now AND C6 holds now (i.e., C5 must hold in the next state).

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- At the initial state S0: event1 happened, and C1 holds, so C2 is true in S0.
- Because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", in the next state S1 event2 happens (and event1 does not happen in S1).
- C5 in S1 requires event1 in S1 (since C5 is C3 or C4, both require event1). But S1 has event2, not event1, so C5 is false in S1.
- Therefore C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false in S0.
- C7 = C2 and C6, so although C2 is true, C6 is false, hence C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---

---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C7.

Step 2 — interpret the context and set up a timeline
Context:
- Initially event1 happened (call that state 0).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" → whenever event1 holds in some state, event2 will hold in the next state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" → whenever event2 holds in some state, event1 will hold in the next state.

This forces an alternating sequence across states:
- state 0: event1 true, event2 false
- state 1: event2 true, event1 false
- state 2: event1 true, event2 false
- state 3: event2 true, ...
and so on.

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci’s
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context (""after event2, event1 must happen"" = eventual/next-state implication), so C1 holds (true as a global rule).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" At the initial state (state 0), C1 holds and event1 happens, so C2 is true at state 0.
- C3 and C4: identical to C2, so they are also true at state 0.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since C3 and C4 are true at state 0, C5 is true at state 0.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" We must check state 1. At state 1, event1 is false (state 1 has event2 true only), so C3 and C4 (which require event1) are false at state 1; therefore C5 is false at state 1. So C6 is false.
- C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds."" C2 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context ""After event2, event1 must happen"" we get C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Because C1 is already true globally, any implication whose consequent is C1 is true. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is true, the disjunction C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" If C3 holds now (it does), it also holds in the next state, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the same as C2 and is true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

Reasoning:

- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 can never occur.
- C4 (""if event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is vacuously true because event2 never happens.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.
- C6 (""event2 happens and C5 holds"") is false (event2 doesn't happen, C5 is false).
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false.
- C8 (""event2 happens or C7 holds"") is false.
- C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer: False

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The system starts with event1 true at the initial state s0. After that no events occur in any future state, so event2 never happens.
- C1 (""event1 always happens"" = G(event1)) is false: event1 is true at s0 but not at later states.
- C2 (G(C1)) is false because C1 is already false.
- C3 (F(C2)) is false because C2 never becomes true.
- C4 (event2 -> C3) is true (vacuously) because event2 never occurs.
- C5 (not C4) is false.
- C6 (event2 and C5) is false (event2 is false and C5 is false).
- C7 (F(C6)) is false because C6 never becomes true.
- C8 (event2 or C7) is false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened. By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 holds in the next state. So C1 and C2 (both ""event1 happens in the next state"") are true.
- The initial event2 is true in the current state, so C3 = (C2 and event2) is true, and C5 (same as C3) is true.
- C6 = C4 or C5; since C5 is true, C6 is true.
- C7 is ""if C1 then C6"". C1 is true and C6 is true, so C7 holds.
- C8 states ""C7 does not hold"". Since C7 does hold, C8 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and the rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" force alternation. So in the next state event1 happens.
- C1 and C2 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") are therefore true.
- C3 and C5 require C2 and that event2 also happens in the next state. But the next state has event1 (not event2), so C3 and C5 are false.
- C4 is ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C3 is false, C4 is vacuously true.
- C6 = C4 or C5, so C6 is true (because C4 is true).
- C7 = ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true and C6 is true, so C7 holds.
- C8 is ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 does hold, C8 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- event1 happens initially.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs later).
- After event2, no other events occur (event2 is terminal).
Thus the actual sequence is: event1 (now) → event2 (later) → stop.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (event1 happens).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 holds and event1 does happen, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 holds now, so eventually C2 holds — True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 holds now, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3, True.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both True, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" C6 holds, and event2 does happen (required after event1), so C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C7 (""If C6 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 does occur sometime after the initial event1.
- After event2 no other events can happen → event2 is terminal, but it does occur.

So the actual event sequence is: event1 (initially), then event2 (later).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True, because event1 did happen.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 holds and event1 does happen, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3; true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 is the implication ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens.""
- C6 does hold, and event2 does indeed happen (by the context). Therefore the implication is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C6 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 does happen.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 will occur sometime after the initial event1.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Terminal, but does not prevent event2 from occurring.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True, because event1 already happened.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 holds and event1 indeed happens, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3; true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" C6 holds, and from the context (after event1, event2 must happen) event2 will happen. So the implication in C7 is satisfied.

Step 1 — what’s asked
C7 is the conjunction “C5 holds and C6 holds.” We must determine whether that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition from the context
- Context: event2 happened initially; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does happen.
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” — False (since event1 does happen).
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” — True (negation of C1).
- C3: “C2 always holds.” — True (C2 is true, so the claim that it holds is true).
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” — False (since C3 is true).
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” — True (negation of C4).
- C6: “C2 always holds.” — True (same as C3).

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You ask whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is True or False. Answer: False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So at the initial state event2 is true and there is no successor state in which any event (including event1) can occur.

2. C1 says event1 happens in the next state. Given (1), there is no next state with events, so C1 is false at the initial state.

3. C2 is ""if event2 happens then C1"". C3 asserts C2 always holds. If C3 were true, then since event2 holds at the initial state, C1 would be forced true — contradicting (2). Hence C3 cannot be true; C3 is false.

4. C5 is ""if C3 holds then C4 holds"". With C3 false, the implication C5 is vacuously true. So C5 holds.

5. C6 asserts ""C5 does not hold"". That is false because we just established C5 holds.

6. C7 is ""event2 happens and C6 holds"". While event2 is true, C6 is false, so C7 is false at the initial state.

7. C8 is ""C7 always holds"". Since C7 is already false at the initial state, C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Goal: determine whether C8 (""C7 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in every state after that initial state no events occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2).

Step 2 — evaluate C1 at the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false (at the initial state).

Step 3 — propagate to the other conditions (at the initial state)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" event2 does happen initially, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C2, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is false, so the implication C3 -> C4 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true). Thus C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" But C5 holds, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Event2 is true, C6 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is false already at the initial state, so C8 is false.

Conclusion: C8 is False. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in every state after that initial state, no events occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2).

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” The next state is after the initial event2, and by the context no events can happen after event2, so event1 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.

Step 3 — propagate to C2, C3, C4
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” Event2 does happen (initially) but C1 is false, so C2 is false (it’s not satisfied at the initial state).
- C3: “C2 always holds.” Since C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C2, so C4 is false.

Step 4 — C5 and C6
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” Since C3 is false, the implication C5 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C6: “C5 does not hold.” But we just found C5 is true, so C6 is false.

Step 5 — C7 and C8
- C7: “Event2 happens and C6 holds.” Event2 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: “C7 always holds.” Since C7 is already false at the initial state, C8 cannot hold.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: timeline is S0 (initial) where event1 happened, then S1 where event2 must happen, and after S1 no events occur.

2. Evaluate components:
   - C1 / C2 / C6: ""Event1 always happens."" This would require event1 at every state. But event1 occurs only at S0 and does not occur at S1 or later. So C1, C2, C6 are false.
   - C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" At S0 event1 happens but C2 is false, so C3 is false at S0.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" At S1, event1 does not happen, so the implication in C3 is vacuously true there; hence C3 holds at S1, so C4 is true (at S0).
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" For any later state n, the next state n+1 has no event1 (after S1), so C3 is vacuously true in every next state; thus C4 holds at every state and C5 is true.
   - C7: ""C5 and C6."" C5 is true but C6 is false, so C7 is false.
   - C8: ""C7 and event2 happens."" C7 is false, so C8 is false (even though event2 happens at S1).
   - C9: ""C1 and C8."" Both parts are false, so C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 occurs, the trace has no further events.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 would also be terminal if it occurred, but it does not.)

Because event1 happened initially and is terminal, event2 never occurs at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false (event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is never true at any time, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 and C5: both are the same as C2, so both false.
- C6: C4 and C5 — false AND false = false.
- C7: C3 or C6 — false OR false = false.

Final answer: False

The hypothesis asks whether C7 (C3 holds or C6 holds) is true given the context.

Context summary: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time.

Evaluate conditions:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): False, because event2 never happens.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds""): False, since C1 is false at all times and cannot become true later.
- C3 (""C2 always holds""): False, because C2 is false.
- C4 (""C1 eventually holds""): False (same as C2).
- C5 (""C1 eventually holds""): False (same as C2/C4).
- C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds""): False, since C4 and C5 are false.
- C7 (""C3 holds or C6 holds""): False, since both C3 and C6 are false.

Final answer: False

We have:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events, including event2, can occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

From ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" it follows that event2 never happens in this run.

Now evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (event2 always happens): False (event2 never happens).
- C2 (C1 eventually holds): False (C1 is false and nothing can change it).
- C3 (C2 always holds): False (C2 is false).
- C4 and C5 (both ""C1 eventually holds""): both False.
- C6 (C4 and C5): False.
- C7 (C3 or C6): False or False = False.

Reasoning:

- From the context: event1 happened (and then event2 happened).
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — this is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen"" — same as C1, so false.
- C4 and C5: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" The antecedent C2 is true and consequent C3 is false, so each implication is false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step-by-step:

- From the context, event1 did happen initially. Therefore the statement ""Event1 does not happen"" is false.
- C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"" → C1 is false.
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" → since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3 = ""Event1 does not happen"" → same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4 = ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" But C2 is true and C3 is false, so the implication is false.
- C5 is identical to C4, so C5 is also false.
- C6 = C4 or C5 = false or false = false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C6 (C4 ∨ C5) is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — facts from context
- Event1 did happen (initially).
- Therefore the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" is false.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" → False.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ¬C1 → True.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen"" → same as C1 → False.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" i.e. C2 → C3. Since C2 is True and C3 is False, the implication is False.
- C5: same as C4 → False.
- C6: C4 ∨ C5 = False ∨ False → False.

True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Initially event2 happened, so C1 (""event2 or event1"") is true. C2 is the same, so true.
- C3 (C1 or C2) is therefore true.
- C4 (C3 does not hold) is false.
- C5 (always C4) is false because C4 is already false now.
- C6 (C5 does not hold) is true.
- C7 (C6 holds in the next state) is false: since after event2 no other events can happen there is no next state, so any ""next"" assertion is false.
- C8 (C7 does not hold) is true.
- C9 (always C8) asks that C8 hold in every state along the trace. There is only the initial state (no further states), and C8 is true there, so C9 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 is true in the initial (and only) state; event1 never happens.

- C1 = (event2 ∨ event1). Since event2 holds initially, C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 is identical to C1, so also true.
- C3 = (C1 ∨ C2) so C3 is true.
- C4 = ¬C3, so C4 is false in the initial state.
- C5 = Always(C4). Since C4 is false in the initial (and only) state, C5 is false.
- C6 = ¬C5, so C6 is true.
- C7 = Next(C6). There is no next state (after event2 no other events can happen), so Next(C6) is false (Next is false on a terminal state).
- C8 = ¬C7, so C8 is true in the initial (and only) state.
- C9 = Always(C8). Because the trace has only the initial state and C8 is true there, Always(C8) is true.

Therefore C9 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened, so ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (C1) is true. C2 is the same, so C2 is true.
- C3 = (C1 or C2) is true.
- C4 = (not C3) is therefore false.
- C5 = ""C4 always holds"" is false because C4 is already false at the initial state.
- C6 = (not C5) is true.
- C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" is false because there is no next state after event2 (the context says no other events can happen), so the ""next"" proposition does not hold.
- C8 = (not C7) is true.
- C9 = ""C8 always holds"" — since the only state (the initial state) satisfies C8, and there are no further states to falsify it, C9 is true."

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context as a timeline of states
- Initially (state S0) event2 happens.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → so S1 has event1.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → so S2 has event2.
- Thus the sequence is S0: e2, S1: e1, S2: e2, S3: e1, … (alternating e2, e1, e2, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci step by step (at S0 unless otherwise noted)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it happens at S0 already, and also repeatedly later).
- C2 and C3: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" True, because C1 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" At S0 C3 holds and event2 happens (so C4 true at S0). But at S1, C3 still holds (C1 is true from S1), while event2 does not happen at S1 (S1 has e1), so C4 is false at S1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" That asserts C4 holds at S1; but we just saw C4 is false at S1. So C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens."" False because C5 is false.
- C7: ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" C2 does hold, but C6 does not, so C7 is false (the implication is false when antecedent true and consequent false).
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" C7 is false at S0 (and remains false at S1), so C8 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happens (call that state 0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so state 1: event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state 2: event2), and so on — events alternate.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1 and C2: ""If event1 then event1"" — tautologies, so C1 and C2 hold in every state.
- C3: ""event2 or C2"" — since C2 is true, C3 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 and event2"" — since C3 is true, C4 ⇔ event2 (C4 holds exactly in states where event2 holds).
- C5: ""not C4"" ⇔ not event2 (holds exactly in states where event2 does not hold).
- C6: ""not C5"" ⇔ event2 (so C6 ⇔ event2).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" ⇔ event2 holds in every state (global requirement).
- C8: ""C1 and C7"" — C1 is true, so C8 ⇔ C7 (i.e., C8 requires event2 in all states).
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" — evaluate C8 in the state immediately after the current one.

Step 3 — evaluate C9 from the initial state
- Current (initial) state 0: event2 holds. Next state 1: event1 holds.
- In state 1, C7 (""event2 holds in all states"") is false because event2 does not hold in state 1 itself (and events alternate).
- Therefore C8 is false in state 1, so C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is false in the initial state.

Final answer:
False
---
We evaluate formulas in the initial state (call it S0). From the context the system alternates between event2 and event1:
- S0: event2 true, event1 false
- S1: event1 true, event2 false
- S2: event2 true, event1 false
- … and so on.

Now evaluate the Ci:

- C1 (event1 -> event1): tautologically true in every state. So C1 holds everywhere.
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 holds everywhere.
- C3 (event2 or C2): since C2 holds, C3 holds everywhere.
- C4 (C3 and event2): equivalent to event2 (because C3 is true), so C4 holds exactly in states S0, S2, ...
- C5 (not C4): holds exactly in states S1, S3, ... (the event1 states).
- C6 (not C5): holds exactly in states S0, S2, ... (the event2 states).
- C7 (C6 always holds): false, because C6 is not true in the event1 states (e.g. S1), so C6 is not true in all states.
- C8 (C1 and C7): false (C1 true but C7 false).
- C9 (C8 holds in the next state): in S0, C9 is true iff C8 holds in S1; but C8 is false in every state, so C9 is false in S0 (and indeed everywhere).

Therefore C9 is False.
---
Reasoning

- Timeline: state0: event2 (initial). state1: event1. state2: event2. They alternate forever.

- C1 and C2: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" is a tautology (true) in any state.

- C3 = (event2) or C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is true in every state.

- C4 = C3 and event2. With C3 true everywhere, C4 is equivalent to event2 — so C4 holds exactly in the states where event2 happens (state0, state2, ...), and is false in states where event1 happens (state1, state3, ...).

- C5 = not C4, so C5 holds exactly in the event1 states (odd states).

- C6 = not C5 = C4 (double negation), so C6 holds exactly in the event2 states (even states).

- C7 = ""C6 always holds"" asserts that C4 is true in every state. That is false, because C4 fails in the event1 states.

- C8 = C1 and C7. Since C7 is false, C8 is false.

- C9 = ""C8 holds in the next state."" From the initial state (state0) the next state is state1; in state1 C8 is false, so C9 is false.

Answer: False

Reason (concise):

- Timeline: S0 (initial) has event2. By the rules, S1 has event1, and after event1 no events occur (S2+ have no events).
- C1 (""event2 in the next state"") is false at S0 because S1 has event1, not event2.
- C2 requires C1 and event1; since C1 is false everywhere, C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 always"") and all subsequent conditions that depend on C2 (C4–C8) are false as well.
- Therefore C9 (""C8 in the next state"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context the only possible trace is: state0: event2 occurs (initially); state1: event1 occurs (because after event2, event1 must happen); after state1 no events occur (after event1 no other events can happen).

- C1 asserts ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. in state1). In the trace, event2 happens in state0 only, not in state1, so C1 is false in state1.

- C2 is ""event1 happens and C1 holds"". Although event1 is true in state1, C1 is false there, so C2 is false in state1.

- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is already false in state1 (and remains false thereafter), C3 is false everywhere.

- C4 (eventually C3) is false because C3 never becomes true. The same argument propagates: every later condition built from C3 by nesting ""eventually""/""next""/""always"" remains false.

- Therefore C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: event2 occurs initially, then event1 must occur after that, and after event1 no further events can occur.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given event1 must happen after event2, the next state will contain event1, not event2. So C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 and event1; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 says C2 always holds; since C2 is false now (and, in fact, cannot hold because C2 would require event1 and then event2 in the following state, but after event1 no events can occur), C3 cannot be true.
- C4–C9 are built from these impossible/false conditions (eventually/next/always combinations). Because C2 is impossible, none of the later conditions can become true, so C9 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 occurs initially. After any event1, event2 must occur; after any event2, event1 must occur. So event1 and event2 alternate, and event1 occurs now and will occur repeatedly (hence ""event1 eventually happens"" is true).

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (occurs initially and again later).

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True — since C1 already holds now (and in the future as well), ""eventually C1"" is satisfied.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (negation of C2).

- C4: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2, True.

- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, True.

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" True (both true).

- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False.

- C8: ""C3 holds or C7 holds."" False or False = False.

Therefore C8 is False.
---
Step-by-step:

- From the context: event1 holds initially. Also after any event1, event2 must occur, and after any event2, event1 must occur. So event1 occurs now and then (by the obligations) event2, then event1, then event2, …; in particular event1 occurs infinitely often.

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it holds initially and in fact infinitely often).

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True. Because C1 holds now, and since event1 recurs infinitely often, C1 will also hold at some later times (so C1 holds eventually).

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (C2 holds).

- C4: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2/C1 — True.

- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1 — True.

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" True (both are True).

- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False.

- C8: ""C3 holds or C7 holds."" Both C3 and C7 are false, so C8 is False.

Final answer: False

Reasoning:

- From the context: initially event1 occurred, and the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an endless alternation event1 → event2 → event1 → ... So event1 occurs now and will occur repeatedly in the future.

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened and will happen again).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True — C1 holds now and at future points (so it certainly holds at some future point).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (C2 holds).
- C4: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2/C1 variant — True.
- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1 — True.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" True (both true).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False (C6 holds).
- C8: ""C3 holds or C7 holds."" Both C3 and C7 are false, so C8 is false.

We are asked whether C9 is true given the context. C9 is ""C8 always holds."" We'll evaluate each Ci in order using the context facts.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the execution is terminal).
- Therefore event2 can never happen (it would have to occur after event1, which is impossible).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (event2 can never happen).
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is False, but event1 did happen initially, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is False and nothing can change (no further events), so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 is False, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is False, so C7 is True.
- C8: ""C1 holds and C7 holds."" C1 is False and C7 is True, so C8 is False.
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" C8 is already false (at the initial state), so it cannot always hold. Thus C9 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context implies: event1 occurs at time 0 and after event1 no other events can occur. Therefore event2 never happens at any later time.
- C1 and C2 (""event2 eventually happens"") are false.
- C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is true at the initial time (because event1 happened initially). At later times C3 becomes false (event1 does not re-occur and C2 never happens).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false initially but becomes true at the next time point.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true (C4 holds at that later time).
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true (C5 already holds).
- C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is false.
- C8 (""C1 holds and C7 holds"") is false (C1 is false).
- C9 (""C8 always holds"") is therefore false.

So C9 is False."

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C9 (""Event1 happens and C8 holds"") is true.

1) From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the initial state is a terminal state (there is no next state) and event1 never happens at any point.

2) Evaluate ""next-state"" formulas: any formula of the form ""holds in the next state"" is false in the initial state because there is no next state.

3) Apply to the conditions:
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (no next state).
- C4 (""If C2 then C3"") is true, because C2 is false so the implication holds.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.
- C6 (""Event2 always happens"") is true (event2 occurs in the only state).
- C7 (""C5 or C6"") is true (because C6 is true).
- C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is false (no next state).
- Event1 happens is false (event1 cannot happen after event2, and event2 happened initially).

4) C9 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens and C8 holds"". Both conjuncts are false, so C9 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state and event1 never happens.
- Any ""in the next state"" claim is false because no next state exists. Thus C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false and C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is false.
- Whether C1/C3/C6 (""Event2 always happens"") are read as true in the single initial state or not, it doesn't matter: event1 does not happen and C8 is false.
- C9 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens and C8 holds"" — since event1 does not happen and C8 is false, C9 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The question asks whether C9 is true.
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. That means the execution stops at that point and event1 never occurs (there is no later moment at which event1 could happen).
- C9 asserts ""Event1 happens and C8 holds."" Since event1 does not happen, the conjunction in C9 is false regardless of C8.
Therefore C9 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C6 is ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" where C4 and C5 both assert ""C3 does not hold"". We must decide whether C6 is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen. So event1 has happened and no event2 can occur afterward (and there is no prior event2).
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is trivially true (and true in the actual history where event1 did happen).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true in the actual situation (and is a stable logical fact here), so C3 holds.
- C4 and C5: each says ""C3 does not hold."" But we have C3 holding, so C4 is false and C5 is false.

Step 3 — conclude about C6
C6 is ""C4 or C5"", i.e. ""C3 does not hold or C3 does not hold"" which is just ""C3 does not hold"". Since C3 does hold, C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C6 (which is ""C4 holds or C5 holds"", i.e. ""C3 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A), so C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 holds (regardless of event2).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C1 is a logical tautology, C2 holds (and so holds at all times), so C3 holds.
- C4 and C5: both assert ""C3 does not hold."" But we just established C3 does hold, so C4 and C5 are false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — equivalently ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C6 (""C4 holds or C5 holds"") is true or false given the listed conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 is true in all states.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true as a logical fact (because C1 is tautologically true), so C2 holds in every state; therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line: C3 is true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C3 does not hold."" Same as C4, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are false, so their disjunction C6 is false.

Step 3 — conclude
- C6 is False

We evaluate the hypothesis at the initial state (where event1 has happened).

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no future event can occur after the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1).

Evaluate conditions step by step (all statements are about the next/future states after the initial state):
- C1 (Event2 happens in the next state): False (no events can happen after event1).
- C2 (Event2 happens in the next state): False (same as C1).
- C3 (C2 eventually holds): False (C2 never becomes true, so it does not eventually hold).
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): False (C3 is false, so it is not true in the next state).
- C5 (C1 holds or C4 holds): False (both C1 and C4 are false).
- C6 (C2 eventually holds): False (same as C3).
- C7 (C5 holds or C6 holds): False (both C5 and C6 are false).
- C8 (C7 holds in the next state): False (C7 is false, so it does not hold in the next state).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C8 asserts: ""C7 holds in the next state."" We must determine whether that is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 has happened (at the initial state).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no events (including event2) can happen in any future state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This forbids event2 occurring at any time after event1 (because event1 cannot then happen after it), reinforcing that event2 cannot occur now or later.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 and C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Impossible (event2 cannot occur after event1). So C1 = False, C2 = False.
- C3 and C6: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., event2 happens eventually). Impossible, so C3 = False, C6 = False.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is false, C4 = False.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Both false, so C5 = False.
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" Both false, so C7 = False.

Step 4 — C8
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" C7 is false now, and because the context forbids any events after event1, the same reasoning applies in the next state, so C7 is false there as well. Therefore C8 = False.

Final answer:
False"
