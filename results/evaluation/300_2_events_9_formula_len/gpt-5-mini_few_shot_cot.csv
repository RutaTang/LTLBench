Context gives the infinite alternating trace:
s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ... (because after event2 → event1 and after event1 → event2, starting at event2).

Interpret formulas relative to states (so ""always"" means from that state onward).

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false at s0 because s1 has event1. In fact C1 is false from every state (the trace alternates).
2. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false at every state.
3. C3: (C1 → C2). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true at every state.

1. Timeline from the context:
   - Initially event2 is true.
   - After event2, event1 must happen next.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 thereafter).
   - So the trace is: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, state2+ = event1, ...

2. Simplify the propositions:
   - C1 = (event1 OR event2).
   - C2 = (C1 OR event1) = (event1 OR event2) = C1.
   - C3 = (C1 OR event1) = C1.
   - Therefore C2 and C3 are identical to C1.

3. C4 = (If C2 holds, then C3 holds) = (C1 -> C1), which is a tautology (true in every state).

4. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"". Since C4 is true in every state (in particular in the initial state), C4 certainly holds eventually. So C5 is True.

5. C6 = (C1 OR event1) = C1 = (event1 OR event2). In the initial state event2 is true, so C6 holds in the initial state.

6. C7 = (C5 holds) AND (C6 holds). We have C5 = True and C6 = True in the initial state, so C7 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The system alternates: initial state0 = event2, state1 = event1, state2 = event2, state3 = event1, ... ad infinitum.
2. C1 is the state formula (event2 -> event1). That is false in states where event2 holds and true in states where event1 holds.
3. C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" So C2 is true at states whose next state is an event1 state, and false at states whose next state is an event2 state. Concretely: C2 is true in event2 states and false in event1 states.
4. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"", so C3 is true exactly in event1 states (since C2 is false there).
5. Starting from the initial state0 (event2), the next state1 is an event1 state, so C3 holds at state1. Thus C3 eventually holds.
6. C4 and C5 both assert ""C3 eventually holds"", so both are true. Therefore C6 = C4 and C5 is true."

Context: The system alternates forever starting from event1: state sequence event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Interpret C1–C9 as state properties / temporal formulas:

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e., not(event2) in the current state.
2. C2 and C3 are the same as C1 (also not(event2)).
3. C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" = event2 -> not(event2). That implication is true exactly when event2 is false, so C4 is equivalent to not(event2) (same as C1).
4. C5: C2 or C4 — both are not(event2), so C5 ≡ not(event2).
5. C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" = ""eventually not(event2)"". From any state in the alternating run:
   - If the current state is event1, not(event2) already holds.
   - If the current state is event2, the next state is event1, so not(event2) holds next.
   Hence C6 holds in every state (the eventuality is always satisfied).
6. C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" Since C6 holds everywhere, this implication is true in every state.
7. C8: ""C7 holds or event1 happens."" C7 already holds in every state, so C8 holds in every state.
8. C9: ""C8 always holds."" Because C8 holds at every state, C9 is true.

System rules:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once in event1 the system stays in event1 forever.
- After event2, event1 must happen — if event2 ever occurred, the next state would be event1 (but event2 can't be reached from event1 because event1 is absorbing).

From these rules, event2 never happens in any reachable state (the only reachable infinite trace is event1, event1, ...).

Now evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — false in every state (next state is always event1).
2. C3 is the same as C1, so also false everywhere.
3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — an implication with a false antecedent, so C2 is true in every state (vacuously).
4. C4: C2 and C3 — since C3 is false, C4 is false everywhere.
5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (F C4) — false, because C4 never holds.
6. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens"" — antecedent C5 is false, so the implication is true in every state (vacuously).
7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — true, because C6 already holds now (so it holds eventually).
8. C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — false.
9. C9: ""C8 does not hold"" — true (negation of false).

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context the system alternates: initial state event2, then event1, then event2, ... So each state satisfies ""event2 or event1"", hence C1 holds at every state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
- C3 is the implication (C2 -> event1). Whether C3 holds depends on the state: C3 is false at the initial state (event1 is false there) but true at the next state (event1 is true there). 
- C4 and C5 are both ""C3 holds in the next state"" — they are the same formula and thus have the same truth value (in this model both are true at the initial state).
- C6 is (C4 -> C5). An implication with identical antecedent and consequent is always true. Hence C6 is True."

1. Initially event1 holds.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means any successor state after an event1 state remains event1 (no transition to event2 or event3). Therefore the next state also has event1 true.
3. C1 (Event1 in the next state) is true (from 2). C8 is the same as C1, so C8 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. States: s0 initially has event1 true. By the rules, the system alternates: s1 has event2, s2 has event1, etc.

2. Evaluate formulas as state predicates.

3. C1: (event1 -> event2).
   - At s0: event1 true and event2 false, so C1 is false.
   - At s1: event1 false, so C1 is true (implication vacuously true).

4. C2 and C3: both are ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C1).
   - At s0: ¬C1 is true.
   - At s1: ¬C1 is false.

5. C4 = C3 ∧ event1.
   - At s0: true ∧ true = true.
   - At s1: false ∧ false = false.

6. C5 = event1 ∨ C4. Since C4 implies event1, C5 simplifies to event1.
   - At s0: true.
   - At s1: false.

7. C6 = (C2 -> C5) i.e. (¬C1 -> event1).
   - At s0: antecedent true, consequent true → C6 true.
   - At s1: antecedent false → C6 true (implication holds).

8. C7 = C6 ∧ event2.
   - At s0: C6 true ∧ event2 false → C7 false.
   - At s1: C6 true ∧ event2 true → C7 true.

9. C8 asserts ""C7 holds in the next state"" (checked from s0). The next state s1 has C7 true, so C8 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Trace of events: initial state = event1. After event1, event2 must occur, and after event2 no other events can happen — so thereafter event2 holds forever. So the infinite run is: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2+: event2.
2. C1 = (event2 → event2). This is a tautology, so C1 holds in every state.
3. C2 and C4 are both ""C1 holds in the next state"". Since C1 holds everywhere, C2 and C4 hold in every state.
4. C3 = ¬C2, so C3 is false everywhere.
5. C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is false (because C3 is false).
6. C6 = ""eventually C5"" is false (C5 never becomes true).
7. C7 = ""always C6"" is false (C6 does not hold).
8. C8 = ¬C7, so C8 is true."

1. Restate key facts:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - From event1, no other events can happen (so all future states stay at event1).
   - From event2, no other events can happen (so any state with event2 would stay at event2).
   - Only one event can hold in a state (as in the examples).

2. Unpack the predicates:
   - C1 and C2 are identical: event2 AND event1 (i.e., both events true in the same state).
   - C3 and C5 are identical: ¬C2 (i.e., C2 does not hold).
   - C4: C3 AND event1 = (¬C2) ∧ event1.
   - C6: If C4 then C5 = ((¬C2 ∧ event1) → ¬C2).
   - C7: C6 holds in the next state.
   - C8: (C1 → C7).

3. Evaluate C6:
   - ((¬C2 ∧ event1) → ¬C2) is logically valid (from A ∧ B → A). So C6 is true in every state.

4. Evaluate C7:
   - C7 says C6 holds in the next state. Since C6 is true in every state, C7 is true wherever a next state exists. In the initial state there is a next state (which is event1), and C6 holds there, so C7 holds.

5. Consider C1 (the antecedent of C8):
   - C1 requires event1 and event2 simultaneously. Given the model (one event per state) and the initial condition (only event1 occurs and no transition to event2), there is no reachable state where C1 holds. So C1 never holds.

6. Evaluate C8 (C1 → C7):
   - An implication with a never-true antecedent is vacuously true. Moreover, even if C1 could hold, C7 is already true in states reached from the initial state (and C6 is a tautology), so C7 would hold as well.
   - Therefore C8 is true.

   - At s1, s+1 = s2 and C1(s2) = False, so C2(s1) = False.
3. C3: same as C1 (event2 -> event1). So C3(s1) = True (since s1 has event1).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context: starting state t0 has event1; rules force alternating states: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ... (periodic).

2. Simplify the named conditions:
   - C1 = (event1 AND event1) = event1.
   - C2 = same = event1.
   - C3 = not C2 = not event1.
   - C4 = eventually C3 = F(not event1). On the path, t1 has event2, so not event1 holds at t1; hence C4 is true at t0.
   - C5 = not C4 = false (because C4 is true).
   - C6 = (C1 -> C5) = (event1 -> false) which is equivalent to not event1. So C6 holds exactly at event2 states (t1, t3, ...), and is false at event1 states.
   - C7 = X C6 (C6 in the next state). At t0, C7 equals C6 at t1, so C7 is true at t0 (since C6 is true at t1).
   - C8 = F(C7). Since C7 is true already at t0, C8 is true at t0.
   - C9 = F(C8). Because C8 is true at t0, C9 is true at t0.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event2 holds, and after either event1 or event2 no other events can happen. That means once in event2 the system stays at event2 forever (event1 never occurs anywhere on the trace).

2. C1, C2, C4, C6 are all the same formula: ""event2 and event1"" (both must hold simultaneously). Given the trace from (1), that conjunction is false everywhere (event1 never holds).

3. C3 is ""if C1 then C2"". Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is a tautology (C1 -> C1) and thus holds in every state.

4. C5 is ""if C3 then C4"". Because C3 holds everywhere, C5 is equivalent to C4, which is again the conjunction ""event2 and event1"" (and thus false everywhere).

5. C7 is ""C5 or C6"". Both disjuncts are the same conjunction ""event2 and event1"", so C7 is equivalent to that conjunction and is false everywhere.

6. C8 is ""C7 always holds"". Since C7 is false at the initial (and all) states, C8 is false.

7. C9 is ""C8 does not hold"" — therefore C9 is true.

Context behavior
- Initially event2.
- From event2 the next state must be event1.
- From event1 the next state must be event2.
So the system alternates forever: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Evaluate the Ci formulas (interpret them as state formulas, with ""always"", ""next"", and ""eventually"" as usual):

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""  
   Interpreted as the state implication (event1 -> event2) holding in the current state. In any state where event1 is false this implication is true; in a state where event1 is true it is false (because event2 is false in the same state). Thus:
   - C1 is true in event2 states, false in event1 states.

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (F C1)  
   From any state there will be an event2 state (they alternate). Since C1 holds in every event2 state, C1 holds at some future state. Therefore C2 is true in every state (including immediately in the initial state).

3. C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" (event2 -> C2)  
   Since C2 holds in every state (just established), the implication is true in every state (both in event2 and event1 states).

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (¬C3)  
   C3 is true everywhere, so C4 is false everywhere.

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (¬C4)  
   Since C4 is false everywhere, C5 is true everywhere.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds."" (G C5)  
   C5 is true in every state, so ""always C5"" is true in every state; C6 holds everywhere.

7. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" (X C6)  
   C6 holds in every state, so it certainly holds in the next state; C7 is true in every state.

8. C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" (X C7)  
   Same reasoning: C7 true everywhere ⇒ C8 true everywhere.

9. C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" (X C8)  
   C8 is true everywhere, so C9 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. That means the system stays at event1 forever; event2 never happens (and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs).

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — False (event2 never occurs).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: C1 and C2 — False.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — True (implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"" — True (antecedent false, so implication true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — True (next state is again event1, where C5 holds).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — True (C6 already holds now).
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" — True (every future state is identical and C7 holds).
- C9: ""C8 always holds"" — True (since C8 already holds globally).

Thus C9 is True."

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen → next state after initial is event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once at event1 it stays at event1 forever.

Evaluate the Cs at the initial state and along the trace:
1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From initial (event2), the next state is event1, so C1 is True.
2. C2: same as C1, so True.
3. C3: C1 and C2 — True (both true).
4. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Along the trace, every state's next state is event1 (it stays at event1), so C1 and C2 hold at every state, hence C3 holds always. So C4 is True.
5. C5: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" True (same as C1).
6. C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Antecedent C4 is True and consequent C5 is True, so the implication C6 is True.
7. C7: ""If C6 holds, then event1 happens (now)."" C6 is True, but in the initial state event1 does not happen (initial state is event2), so the implication C7 is False.

Context behavior: starting state has event1. After event1, event2 must occur next; after event2, event1 must occur next. So the system alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... forever.

1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""  
   - From an event1 state, event2 happens in the next state. From an event2 state, event2 already holds (so ""eventually"" is true immediately). Thus C1 holds in every state.

2. C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""  
   - In event1 states C2 holds because event1 is true. In event2 states C2 holds because C1 is true. So C2 holds in every state.

3. C3 and C4: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" (both are the same formula)  
   - In event2 states the implication is true (C2 holds and event2 holds). In event1 states C2 holds but event2 does not hold in that same state, so the implication is false there. Therefore C3 and C4 are false in event1 states and true in event2 states.

4. C5 = (C3 holds) or (C4 holds). Since C3 and C4 are equivalent, C5 is true exactly in event2 states and false in event1 states.

5. C6: ""C5 eventually holds.""  
   - From any state (event1 or event2), there is an event2 state at or immediately next (alternation). So from any state C5 holds either now or next, hence C6 holds in every state.

6. C7: ""C6 always holds.""  
   - Because C6 holds in every state, C7 is true.

Context summary:

- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state is event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (it stays at event2 forever).

Interpretations used: ""eventually"" includes the current state (as in the examples); only one event is true per state.

1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just event2. So C1 ⇔ event2 (holds in a state exactly when that state is event2).
2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means ""eventually event2"". From the initial state, event2 occurs in the next state, so C2 is true at the initial state; from any event2 state, C2 is true (event2 holds now).
3. C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"". At the initial state event1 is true, so C3 true there. At event2 states, event1 is false but C2 is true (event2 holds), so C3 is true there as well.
4. C4 is identical to C3, so it has the same truth value in every state.
5. C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 and C4 are equivalent, the implication is always true in any state.
6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Check next-state truth:
   - From the initial state, the next state is event2; we saw C5 is true at event2, so C6 is true at the initial state.
   - From any event2 state, the next state is event2 again, and C5 is true there, so C6 is true at every event2 state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context: initial state = event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, ... (alternating forever).
- So event1 is true in every odd state and false in every even state; in particular, event1 is not true in all states.

Evaluate the Ci formulas on this path (at the initial state):

1. C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" (G event1). False (event1 is false in some states).
2. C2 = (C1 -> event1). Since C1 is false, the implication is true (false -> anything = true). So C2 is true in every state.
3. C3 = same as C1, so false.
4. C4 = (C2 -> C3). C2 is true and C3 is false, so C4 is false in every state.
5. C5 = (event1 -> C4). At states where event1 is false this is true; at states where event1 is true this requires C4 (which is false), so C5 is false at event1-states and true at event2-states.
6. C6 = (event1 AND C5). This requires event1 true and C5 true simultaneously; but whenever event1 is true, C5 is false. So C6 is false in every state.
7. C7 = (eventually C6) = F C6. Since C6 never holds, C7 is false.
8. C8 = (C7 -> event1). Since C7 is false, this implication is true in every state.
9. C9 = (C8 OR event1). C8 is true, so C9 is true.

Context dynamics:

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (G event1).

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" (C1 -> event1).

5. C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens"" (C4 ∨ event2).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

Context timeline:
- State 0 (initial): event1
- State 1: event2 (because after event1, event2 must happen)
- State 2, 3, ...: event2 forever (after event2 no other events can happen)

Evaluate each Ci at State 0 (unless otherwise noted):

1. C1 (event2 in the next state): At state0, state1 is event2 → C1 is true.
2. C2 (C1 in the next state): At state1, C1 means event2 at state2, which is true → C2 is true at state0.
3. C3 (if event1 then C2): At state0 event1 holds and C2 holds → C3 true at state0.
4. C4 (C3 eventually holds): C3 already holds at state0 → C4 true at state0.
5. C5 (C4 in the next state): At state1, C4 holds (C3 holds at state1 vacuously) → C5 true at state0.
6. C6 (if C5 then event2): At state0 C5 is true but event2 is false at state0 → C6 false at state0.
7. C7 (event2 in the next state): Same as C1, true at state0.
8. C8 (if C6 then C7): At state0 antecedent C6 is false, so implication is true → C8 true at state0.
9. C9 (C8 in the next state): At state1, recomputing:
   - C5 is true at state1, and event2 holds at state1, so C6 is true at state1.
   - C7 is true at state1 (event2 at state2).
   - Hence C8 is true at state1.
   Therefore C9 (C8 holds in the next state) is true at state0.

Thus C9 is True."

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the system remains in states where event1 holds (event2 never occurs along that run).
- After event2, no other events can happen (not relevant because event2 never occurs here).

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
   - At the initial state event1 is true and event2 is not true, so the implication event1 ⇒ event2 is false there.
   - Therefore C1 does not hold (is false).

2. C2: C1 does not hold.
   - From (1) C1 is false at the initial state, so C2 is true (it holds).

3. C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.
   - On the only reachable run, event2 never occurs, so the antecedent is always false; the implication is vacuously true in every state.
   - Thus C3 holds in all states.

4. C4: C3 always holds.
   - Since C3 is true in every state along the run, C4 is true.

5. C5: C4 always holds.
   - C4 is already true, so C5 is true.

6. C6: C5 always holds.
   - Likewise, C6 is true.

7. C7: C6 eventually holds.
   - If C6 holds always, it certainly holds eventually; so C7 is true.

8. C8: C7 eventually holds.

1. From the context: initial state has event2 true.
2. After event2, event1 must happen → the next state is event1.
3. After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 occurs the system stays at event1 forever.
4. So the full sequence is: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, state2 = event1, ... (event1 forever after state1).

Now evaluate the Ci in this sequence:

7. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True — C2 holds, and event2 also holds initially.
8. C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
9. C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" True — both C3 and C4 are true, so the implication holds.
10. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False — C5 holds, so its negation is false.
11. C7: ""C6 always holds."" False — C6 is already false at the initial state, so it does not always hold.
12. C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" False — C7 never becomes true in the sequence, so it does not eventually hold.

1. The context forces an infinite alternation: initial state has event1, next event2, next event1, and so on forever. So each state is either event1 or event2, alternating.

2. Identify tautologies:
   - C1, C2, C5, C7 are all ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — i.e., p -> p. Those are tautologies and therefore hold in every state.

3. C3 = C1 or C2. Since C1 (and C2) hold everywhere, C3 holds in every state (C3 is true).

4. C4 = (If C3 holds, then event2 happens), i.e. C3 -> event2. Because C3 is true in every state, C4 is equivalent to requiring event2 in that state; thus C4 is true exactly in the states where event2 holds (and false in the event1 states). But we do not need C4 to be true everywhere for the rest.

5. C5 is a tautology (holds everywhere). Therefore C6 = (If C4 holds, then C5 holds) = C4 -> C5 is true in every state because its consequent C5 is always true (an implication with true consequent is always true).

6. C7 is a tautology (holds everywhere). So C8 = C6 or C7 is true in every state (since both disjuncts hold everywhere).

7. C9 is ""C8 eventually holds."" Because C8 already holds in the initial state, ""eventually"" is satisfied immediately. Therefore C9 is true.

1. From the context, the timeline of states is:

   - After event1, event2 must happen, so t1: event2 is true.
   - After event2 no other events can happen, so from t1 onward the system stays at event2 (event2 true, event1 false).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — interpreted as both true in the same state. There is no state where event1 and event2 are true simultaneously (t0 has only event1, t1+ has only event2). So C1 is always false.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 never holds, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" — at the initial state t0 event1 is true, so C3 is true (even though C2 is false).

5. C4 is the same as C3, so C4 is true at t0 but not necessarily at later states.

6. C5: ""C4 always holds"" — false, because at t1 and later event1 is false and C2 is false, so C4 is false there. Thus C5 is false.

7. C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — true (negation of the false C5).

8. C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds"" — both are true (C3 true at t0, C6 true), so C7 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays in event1 in the initial and all future states (event1 holds always).
2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological material implication (p → p) and is true in every state.
3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds in the initial state (indeed in every state), C2 is true.
4. C3: same as C2, so true.
5. C4 and C5 are the same tautology as C1, so both true.

1. Context: Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the system starts in a state with event2, and every subsequent state also has event2 (it stays in event2 forever). The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

1. From the context the only possible path is: s0 = event2 (initial), s1 = event1 (must follow event2), s2 = event1, ... (once event1 happens no other events can happen).

2. C1 = ""event2 does not happen"":
   - false at s0 (event2 holds),
   - true at s1 and thereafter (event2 does not hold).

3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"":
   - From s0 there is s1 where C1 holds, and from s1 it already holds. So C2 is true at all states.

4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"":
   - Since C2 is true at every state, C3 is true.

5. C4 = ""C3 holds or event1 happens"":
   - C3 is true, so C4 is true at every state (regardless of event1).

6. C5 = ""C4 does not hold"":
   - Since C4 is always true, C5 is false at every state.

7. C6 = ""C5 eventually holds"":
   - C5 never holds, so C6 is false at every state.

   - C6 is false, so C7 is false at every state.

Context behavior:
- Initially event2 is true (state S0).

- From event1 the system must go to event2, so the system alternates: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, ...

Evaluate the claims (all evaluated pointwise/temporally as used below):

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""  
   - At an event2 state (e.g. S0) event2 is true and event1 is false, so the implication is false there. At event1 states the implication is vacuously true. So C1 is not true in all states; in particular C1 is false at event2 states.

2. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (¬C1)  
   - At event2 states (like S0) C1 is false, so C2 is true there. At event1 states C1 is true, so C2 is false there.

3. C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" (event1 ∧ ¬C1)  
   - For C3 to hold we need event1 true and C2 true simultaneously. But at event1 states C2 is false (see above). At event2 states event1 is false. So C3 is false in every state.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds.""  
   - Since C3 is false in every state, C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 always holds.""  
   - C4 is false, so C5 is also false.

6. C6: same as C1 (If event2 then event1) — same truth pattern as C1.

7. C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" (C5 → C6)  
   - C5 is false in all states, so the implication C5 → C6 is true (vacuously) in every state.

8. C8: ""C7 always holds.""  
   - Because C7 is true in every state, C8 is true (globally true).

9. C9: ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" (C8 ∧ event2)

Context: initial state s0 has event2. After event2 → event1, after event1 → event2, so the system alternates forever: s0:event2, s1:event1, s2:event2, s3:event1, ...

1. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" In every state event1 occurs either now (if the state is an event1 state) or next (if the state is an event2 state). So C1 is true in every state.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 holds everywhere, C3 is false everywhere.

9. C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" From the initial state s0 (event2), the next state s1 is an event1 state where C8 holds. Event1 states occur infinitely often, so C8 does occur in the future. Therefore C9 is true at the initial state.

  C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false (because event2 is true).

  C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — false (next state still has event2, so C1 is false there).

  C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" — since event2 is true, C3 is equivalent to C2, hence false.

  C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — false (next state's C3 is false).

  C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"" — antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is true (false → true is true). Thus C5 is true in every state.

  C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — true (C5 already holds now).

- C1 = ""Event1 does not happen"" holds exactly in the event2 states.
- Take any state s where C1 holds (so s is an event2 state). Its next state s' is an event1 state.
- In s' the next state s'' is event2, so C5 (""next state: event1 does not happen"") holds at s' immediately. Hence C6 (""eventually C5"") holds at s'.

1. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to just Event2 (C1 ⇔ Event2).

2. Simplify the conditions:
- C1 = (event2 or event2) = event2.

- C8 = always(C7) (C7 must hold in every state).

3. Evaluate C7 on all states of the trace:
- state0 (initial): event1 is true, so C7 true.
- state1 and onward: event2 is true; next(event2) is true (the next state also has event2), so C7 true in every later state.

   - s2, s3, ...: event1 (stays at event1 forever)

2. Let P = ""event1 holds"". Then:
   - C1 = ""P in the next state"" = X P. At s0 this is true (s1 has P).
   - C2 = ""C1 in the next state"" = X C1 = X^2 P. At s0 this is true (s2 has P).
   - C3 = ""C2 in the next state"" = X C2 = X^3 P. At s0 this is true (s3 has P).
   - C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" = F C3. Since C3 already holds at s0 (and at all states), C4 is true.
   - C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬C4, so C5 is false.
   - C6 = ""C2 in the next state"" = X C2, which equals C3 and is true.

Context summary (possible execution):
- Start: event2.

- After event1, no other events can happen — treat as event1 being absorbing (it stays event1 thereafter).

Context recap:
- State0 (initial): event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen → State1: event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from State1 onward only event1 is true.

Evaluate each condition at the initial state (and where needed, at next states):

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At State0 the next state is State1 where event1 holds (not event2). So C1 is False.
2. C2: same as C1, so False.
3. C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" (i.e. event2 -> next(event2)). At State0 event2 is true but next(event2) is false, so the implication is False at State0. So C3 is False.
4. C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is False, so the implication is vacuously True. C4 is True.
5. C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" C4 is True, so C5 is True.
6. C6: same as C3 (event2 -> next(event2)). It is False at State0 for the same reason, but note its truth can change in future states.
7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" At State1 event2 is false, so the implication event2 -> next(event2) is vacuously True there. Thus C6 holds at State1, so C6 eventually holds. C7 is True.
8. C8: ""C5 holds and C7 holds."" Both are True, so C8 is True.

Reasoning (concise):
- Timeline from the context: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, and thereafter event1 forever.
- C5 (event1 ∧ event1) is simply ""event1"" and is false at the initial state (state0).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at state0 (event1 occurs at state1), so C4 ((C2 → C3)) is false at state0 because C3 (event1) is false at state0.
- Thus C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is false at the initial state.
- Therefore C6 is not true at every state, so C7 (""C6 always holds"") and C8 (""C7 always holds"") are false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true (S0).
- After event1, event2 must happen, so S1 is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so it stays at event2 if there is a next state).

1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" From S0, event2 occurs in the next state S1, so C1 is true.
2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At S0, the next state S1 has event2 (so C1 is also true at S1), hence C2 is true at S0.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays at event1 in every state (event1 is true now and forever).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to Event1. Hence C1 holds in the initial state and in every state.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" is true because C1 (i.e., event1) holds in all states.

4. C3, C4: both are the same tautology as C1 (Event1).

5. C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" reduces to Event1, so it holds in all states.

6. C6: ""Event1 and C5"" reduces to Event1, so it holds in all states.

7. C7: ""C6 always holds"" is true (C6 holds in every state).

8. C8: ""If event2 happens, then C7 holds."" Since event2 never occurs (we start at event1 and can never leave it), the implication is vacuously true; also C7 is true anyway, so C8 is true.

9. C9: ""If C2 holds, then C8 holds."" We have C2 true and C8 true, so C9 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The context produces a single trace: initial state = event1, then next state = event2, and thereafter event2 forever (event2 is absorbing).

2. C1 = (event1 or event2). That is true in every state of the trace (true in the initial event1 state and in all subsequent event2 states).

3. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

4. C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is true. C4 = (C3 holds AND event2). Since C3 is true, C4 is equivalent to event2 (true exactly in event2 states).

5. C5 = ""C4 always holds"" therefore would require event2 in every state. But the initial state is event1, so C5 is false.

6. C6 = (C5 AND event2) is false (because C5 is false) in every state. Hence C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is false in the initial state.

7. We have C2 true and C7 false, so the implication C2 -> C7 is false.

Thus C8 is False."

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. Context: initial state is event2, and after event2 no other events can happen — so the system stays at event2 forever. The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

2. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since the system stays at event2 forever, event1 never happens → C1 is False.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from an event1 state the system remains at event1 (event1 is absorbing).
- After event2, event1 must happen → any event2 transition leads immediately to event1 (irrelevant here because we never start at event2).

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" In the initial state event1 holds and no other events can happen afterwards, so event2 never occurs. Thus C1 is true (event2 does not happen).

2. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is true and event1 holds in the initial state, so C2 is true in the initial state.

3. C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Since event1 holds and C2 holds in that same state, the implication is true. So C3 is true.

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 holds in the (reachable) next state, C7 is true (it holds at some future point).

8. C8: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is the same as C1 and is true in the initial state.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen ⇒ the system stays in event2 forever (event2 holds in the next state and all subsequent states).
- After event1, no other events can happen (not relevant because event1 never occurs here).

Evaluate the formulas (all evaluated in the initial state, but because event2 persists, they hold in every state):

1. C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state"" = X(event2). Since after event2 the system stays in event2, C1 is true.
2. C2 = ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" = event2 ∨ X(event2). event2 is true now, so C2 is true.
3. C3 = same as C2, so C3 is true.
4. C4 = X(C3). Since C3 is true in the next state (because event2 persists), C4 is true.
5. C5 = (C4 → event2). C4 is true and event2 is true, so the implication is true.
6. C6 = C2 ∨ C5. Both disjuncts are true, so C6 is true.
7. C7 = C6 ∧ event2. Both are true, so C7 is true.
8. Because the system remains in event2 at every state, the same reasoning applies at every state, so C7 holds in all states. Therefore C8 = ""C7 always holds"" is true.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after the initial state is event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen — i.e., the system stays at event2 forever after reaching it.

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At the initial state (event1), the next state is event2, so C1 is true at the initial state. At any event2 state, the next state is event2, so C1 is also true there.

2. C2: same as C1, so also true.

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is true (it holds immediately).

4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" The next state is event2, and as noted, at event2 C2 holds in the next state (and hence C3 holds there). So C4 is true at the initial state.

5. C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Both C1 and C4 are true at the initial state, so C5 is true. At event2 states, C1 and C4 remain true, so C5 holds there too.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is true in the initial state and remains true in every subsequent state (the system goes to event2 and stays there), C6 is true.

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 holds immediately, so C7 is true.

Context summary: initial state = event2. From event2 the next state must be event1. From event1 no other events can happen (so it stays at event1 thereafter).

Evaluate the components at the initial state:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At the initial state, the next state is event1, so C1 is false at the initial state.

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. (event1 -> next event2). This implication is:
  - true in states where event1 is false (vacuously),
  - false in states where event1 is true (because after event1 the next state is event1, not event2).
  Since event1 does occur (from the second state onward), C2 is not true in all states.

- C3 and C4: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false in states where event1 holds, C3 and C4 are false.

- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" At the initial state, C4 is false and event1 is false, so C5 is false at the initial state.

- C6: ""C5 holds or event2 happens."" At the initial state event2 is true, so C6 is true at the initial state.

- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" At the initial state C3 is false but C6 is true, so C7 is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True."

1. Initially event2 is true.
2. After event2, no other events can happen, so from the initial state the system stays at event2 forever. Therefore event1 never happens in any state.
3. C1: (event1 or event2). Since event2 is true, C1 is true (in all states).
4. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also true (in all states).

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context: system starts in event1 and after event1 no other events can happen, so the only reachable behavior is event1 forever (event2 never occurs).
- C1 = not event1 is false in every state.
- C2 = C1 or event2 is false (event2 never occurs).
- C3 = event2 or C2 is false.
- C4 = next C3 is false (next state is still event1).
- C5 = eventually C4 is false (C4 never becomes true).

Context gives the state sequence: S0: event1 true. Then S1 onward: event2 true (event2 must happen after event1, and after event2 no other events can happen).

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p -> p). So C1 is true in every state.
2. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is true in every state.
3. C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 holds everywhere and event1 holds in S0, so C3 is true in S0 (but false in states where event1 is false).
4. C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" In states where event2 is true (S1 onward), event1 is false, so C3 is false there. Thus C4 is false.
5. C5: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, a tautology, so C5 is true everywhere.

2. C2: C1 eventually holds (F C1).
3. C3: C1 eventually holds (same as C2).
4. C4: If C2 then C3 — i.e., (F C1) → (F C1), which is a tautology (always true).
5. C5: C4 always holds (G C4). Since C4 is always true, C5 is true in every state.

- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus the system alternates: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ... — event1 occurs at every odd state but not at every state.

Step 2 — evaluate the components:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (globally). This is false (not true at s0).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is a future point from which event1 holds forever). This is false — the system never reaches a state after which only event1 holds (it keeps alternating).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false because C2 is false at every state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — false.
- C5: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — same as C3, false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — false (both conjuncts false).

3. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is false in the initial state (and all states), C2 is false.

5. C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is false, C4 is true.

6. C5 = (event1 happens) or C4 — C4 is true, so C5 is true.

7. C6 = C2 and C5 — C2 is false and C5 true, so C6 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. System behavior: initially event1, and after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen. So states alternate event1, event2, event1, event2, ... forever. (This alternation just describes the timeline; it won't falsify the tautologies below.)

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology A -> A, so C1 holds in every state.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds in every state, C1 certainly holds at some future state (indeed at all future states), so C2 is true in every state.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is true in every state, C2 holds in the next state as well, so C3 is true in every state.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true everywhere, C4 is false everywhere.

6. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Negating a false statement gives true, so C5 is true in every state.

7. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is true in every state, so C6 is true in every state.

8. C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" C6 holds everywhere, so this disjunction is true in every state; C7 is true everywhere.

9. C8: ""C7 always holds."" Because C7 is true in every state, C8 is true in every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

Context: states alternate: S0: event1 (initial), S1: event2, S2: event1, ... (event1 → event2 → event1 ...).

Interpret C1..C8 at a state as formulas evaluated there; ""holds in the next state"" refers to the immediate successor.

Evaluate at S0:

- C1 = event2 at S0 → false.
- C2 = C1 in next state = C1 at S1 = event2 at S1 → true.
- C3 = (C2 → event2) at S0. C2 is true (because of S1) but event2 at S0 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 = C1 in next state = same as C2 → true.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 → false ∧ true → false.
- C6 = C5 ∨ event1 → false ∨ true → true.
- C7 = ¬C6 → false.
- C8 = C7 in next state = C7 at S1. So we must evaluate C7 at S1.

Evaluate at S1:

- event2 is true, event1 false.
- C1 at S1 = event2 → true.
- C2 at S1 = C1 at S2 = event2 at S2 (S2 is event1) → false.
- C3 at S1 = (C2 → event2) → vacuously true (C2 false).
- C4 at S1 = C1 at S2 = false.
- C5 at S1 = C3 ∧ C4 → true ∧ false → false.
- C6 at S1 = C5 ∨ event1 → false ∨ false → false.
- C7 at S1 = ¬C6 → true.

Thus C7 holds at S1, so C8 (C7 in the next state from S0) is true."

- C2: same as C1 — true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — true (C1 and C2 are both true, and the implication holds).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — true (C3 is true, and event1 also holds).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — true, because C4 is true in the initial state and remains true in every future state (event1 and the facts behind C3/C4 persist).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — true (C5 is globally true, so it holds in the next state).

- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true (C3 already holds now), and C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true (C4 holds in all states).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event1 is true, and after event1 no other events can happen, so the system stays forever in the event1 state.
2. C1 = (event1 or event2). Since event1 is true initially (and forever), C1 is true.
3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is true.
4. C3 = C1 and C2, so C3 is true.
5. Because the system remains in the same event1 state forever, any property true now remains true in all future states. Thus C3 holds in every state, so C4 (C3 always holds) is true.
6. If C4 always holds, then C5 (C4 eventually holds) is true (it already holds now).
7. C6 = (C5 holds in the next state). Since the next state is also event1 and C5 holds everywhere, C6 is true.
8. From C6 being true, C7 (C6 eventually holds) is true; then C8 (C7 eventually holds) is true; and finally C9 (C8 eventually holds) is true.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" — this is true in any state where event1 is true (and here event1 holds), so C1 is true everywhere reachable.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 holds, C2 is false everywhere.

2. C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false (event2 never occurs).

3. C2 = (C1 or event1). Since event1 holds now, C2 is true at the initial state (and at every state, because event1 persists).

4. C3 = (if C2 then event2). At any state where C2 is true and event2 is false, C3 is false. Thus C3 is false (including the initial state).

5. C4 = (if event2 then C3). Because event2 never occurs on the actual run, this implication is vacuously true. So C4 holds.

6. C5 = (if C2 then event2) — this is the same as C3, so C5 is false.

7. C6 = (C4 or C5). Since C4 is true, C6 is true.

8. The next state after the initial state is still event1 (no other events can happen). Re-evaluating at that next state gives the same truth values: C4 true, C5 false, so C6 true at the next state.

Step 2 — evaluate the subformulas:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" On the trace of all-event1, the next state always has event1, so C1 is true at every state (in particular true at the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 holds at every state, C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1 always holds → true.
- C4: same → true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is true and C4 is true, the implication is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true at the initial state (and indeed at every state).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 already holds at the initial state, it certainly holds eventually. So C7 is true.

Context summary: initial state S0: event2. From event2, event1 must happen next. From event1, no other events can happen (so once at event1, all future states are event1).

State sequence: S0: event2; S1: event1; S2: event1; ...

Evaluate the formulas:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" ≡ event2. So C1 holds exactly in states where event2 is true (holds at S0, not at S1+).
2. C2: same as C1 ≡ event2.
3. C3: C1 and C2 ≡ event2.
4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = ""eventually event2"". This is true at S0 because event2 holds at S0 (eventually includes the current state). So C4 holds at S0. At S1 and later, C4 is false (no future event2).
5. C5: C4 holds and event2 happens. At S0: C4 true and event2 true → C5 true. At S1+: event2 is false, so C5 false.
6. C6: ""C5 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C5. So at S0 C6 false; at S1+ C6 true.
7. C7: ""C6 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C6 ≡ C5 (double negation). So C7 is true exactly where C5 is true — true at S0, false at S1+.
8. C8: ""Event1 happens or C7 holds"" ≡ event1 ∨ C5. Check each state:
   - S0: event1 false but C5 true → C8 true.
   - S1 and later: event1 true → C8 true.
   So C8 holds in every state along the trace.
9. C9: ""C8 always holds"" — since C8 is true at S0 and every subsequent state, C9 is True.

Context timeline:
- State0: initially event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so State1: event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so from State1 onward every state has event2.

Evaluate the conditions:
1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
   - At State0 the next state is State1 (event2), so C1 holds at State0.  
   - At any state that has event2, the next state also has event2 (the system stays at event2), so C1 holds at every state. Thus C1 is always true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. System behavior: initially event1, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays in states where event1 holds forever. (Event2 never actually occurs along the only possible path, but that does not affect tautologies below.)

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — this is a propositional tautology (p -> p). So C1 is true in every state.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true.

4. C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" — C2 holds, so C3 is true in every state (and moreover event1 holds in every state as well).

5. C4: ""C3 always holds"" — true because C3 holds in every state.

6. C5: ""C1 always holds"" — same as C2, true.

7. C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — both are true, so C6 holds (in fact globally).

8. C7: ""C6 always holds"" — since C6 is a global truth, C7 holds.

9. C8: ""C7 eventually holds"" — anything that always holds certainly holds at some future point, so C8 is true.

1. Context: initially event2 is true. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" implies every state after event2 also has event2 (the system stays at event2). The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

2. C1 = Next(event2). At the initial state s0 (event2), the next state s1 also has event2, so C1 is true at s0. Likewise C2 = Next(event2) is the same and true at s0.

3. C3 = Next(C2) = Next(Next(event2)). Because the sequence stays at event2, C2 holds at s1, so C3 holds at s0.

4. C4 = C1 or C3. Since C1 (and C3) hold at s0, C4 holds at s0.

5. C5 = Eventually(C4). Because C4 already holds at s0 (and in fact at every state), C5 holds at s0.

6. C6 = Always(C5). At every state si (all are event2 states), the same reasoning applies: C4 holds immediately, so C5 holds at every state. Thus C6 is true.

7. C7 = Eventually(C6). Since C6 holds now, C7 is true. C8 = Eventually(C7) and C9 = Eventually(C8) are then also true (eventually of something already true is true).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The context forces an infinite alternation: starting state0 = event2, then state1 = event1, state2 = event2, state3 = event1, etc.
2. C1 = (event1 or event2). In every state exactly one of event1/event2 holds, so C1 is true in every state.
3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"". Since C1 holds in every state, C2 holds in every state (the next state also satisfies C1).
4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"". Because C2 already holds now (and everywhere), C3 is true.
5. C4 is the same as C3, so it is true.
6. C5 = (event1 and C4). C4 is true, so C5 holds in precisely the states where event1 holds (i.e. the odd states).
7. C6 = (C5 and event1) — equivalent to C5, so it holds in some states (those with event1).
8. C7 = (C3 or C6). Since C3 is true, C7 is true regardless of C6.

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state the next state is event1 (because event1 persists), so C1 is true at the initial state — and in fact true at every state (the next state of any event1 state is event1).
2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 holds at every state along the run, C2 is true.
3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is ¬C2, so C3 is false (because C2 is true).
4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is ¬C3, so C4 is true.
5. C5: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Same as C1, so true.
6. C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" True ∧ True = True.
7. C7: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" True again.
8. C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" True ∨ True = True.
9. C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" C8 already holds at the initial state, so it certainly holds eventually. Therefore C9 is true.

1. From the context: state0 = event2. After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen. So the state sequence is event2 (state0), event1 (state1), event2 (state2), event1 (state3), ... — alternating forever.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At state0 this means event2 at state1? No — C1 at state0 asserts event2 at state1. But we will evaluate where needed.

3. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication (event1_at_current -> event2_at_next).

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So at state0, C3 means at state1 the implication (event1_at_state1 -> event2_at_state2) holds.

5. Evaluate C3: at state1 event1 is true, and at state2 event2 is true, so the implication at state1 is true. Therefore C2 holds at state1, so C3 is true at state0.

6. C4 = not C3, so C4 is false at state0. C5 = not C4, so C5 is true at state0 (since C3 is true).

7. C6 is the same as C2 (if event1 then C1); we already know that implication holds at state0 vacuously because event1 is false at state0, so C6 is also true at state0.

8. C7 = C5 or C6. Both disjuncts are true at state0, so C7 is true.

9. C8 = (event2 at current state) AND C7. event2 is true at state0 and C7 is true, so C8 is true at the initial state.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is an absorbing state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be absorbing, but event2 is not reachable from the initial state).

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 never occurs along the actual run (we start at event1 and stay there), the implication is vacuously true. So C1 holds.

2. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" At the initial state, C1 is true and event1 is true, so C2 holds at the initial state.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" From event1 the system stays at event1, so in the next state event1 is true and C1 still holds; therefore C2 holds in the next state. Thus C3 is true (already at the initial state we can see the next state satisfies C2).

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 already holds (as observed), C4 is true.

5. C5: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This is the same fact as C3 stated; C5 is true.

6. C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: initially event1. After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
2. C1: ""Event1 and event1"" simplifies to event1 (true exactly in states where event1 holds). C2 is identical to C1, so C2 = event1.
3. C3 = C1 and C2 = event1 and event1 = event1.
4. C4: ""C3 always holds"" means event1 holds in every state. This is false because the system alternates and in event2 states event1 does not hold.
5. C5 (next C4), C6 (next C5) are therefore false. C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false. C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is false (C7 never holds). C9 (""C8 always holds"") is false.

1. Timeline from the context:
   - s0 (initial): event2 is true.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → s1: event1 is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → s2, s3, ... remain event1.

2. Evaluate the named formulas at the initial state s0:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" → asks whether event2 is true in s1. In s1 event1 is true, so C1 is false.
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" → at s0, C1 is false and event1 is false, so C2 is false.
   - C3: same as C2 (given), so C3 is false.
   - C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" → since C2 and C3 are both false, C4 is false.
   - C5 and C6: both are ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (same as C1), so both are false at s0.

3. C3 and C4 require event2 and C2; they are false (C2 is false and event2 never occurs).

1. System description:
   - Initially event2 is true.

2. C1 = event1 AND event1, which is just event1. So C1 is true exactly in the event1 states (s0, s2, ...), false in event2 states.

4. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is false at every state.

5. C4 = (event2 => C3). At event1 states the antecedent is false so C4 is true vacuously; at event2 states the antecedent is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false at every event2 state. Thus C4 alternates: true at event1 states, false at event2 states.

6. C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4). Because C4 is true at event1 states and false at event2 states, X C4 is true at event2 states (next is event1) and false at event1 states. So C5 is true exactly at event2 states, false at event1 states.

7. C6 = (C5 AND event1). That requires both C5 true and event1 true in the same state. But C5 true only at event2 states, and event1 true only at event1 states—there is no state where both hold. So C6 is false in every state.

1. From the context: initially event2, and the rules force a strict alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 ... forever. So in every state either event1 or event2 holds (exactly one).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — true in every state.  
   C2 and C3 are the same as C1, so they are also true in every state.

3. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — since C3 holds always, C4 holds in every state.

4. C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds"" — both conjuncts hold always, so C5 holds in every state.

5. C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds"" — antecedent and consequent both hold always, so C6 holds in every state.

6. C7: ""C6 always holds"" — true (C6 indeed holds in every state).

7. C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — false, because C7 does hold.

8. C9: ""C8 eventually holds"" — false, because C8 is never true in any state.

Therefore C9 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the tautology (event1 → event1), so C1 holds in every state.
2. Therefore C2 (C1 → event2) simplifies to event2. So C2 holds exactly in event2-states.
3. C3 is identical to C1 (event1 → event1), so C3 also holds in every state.
4. C4 (C1 → event2) is the same as C2, so C4 = event2.
5. C5 (C3 → C4) reduces to C4 because C3 is always true, hence C5 = event2.
6. C6 = C2 ∨ C5 = event2 ∨ event2 = event2.
7. C7 is ""eventually C6"", i.e. eventually event2. Since the system starts in event2 and alternates event2 ↔ event1, event2 occurs (now and repeatedly), so C7 holds (in fact C7 holds in every state).
8. C8 is C7 ∧ event1. Because C7 is true everywhere, C8 is equivalent to event1. At the initial state event1 is false (initially event2), so C8 is false at the initial state.

The hypothesis is evaluated at the initial state, so C8 is False."

Context transitions:
- Initial state S0: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → S1: event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → S2, S3, ...: event1 forever.

Evaluate the formulas (all are state formulas unless a temporal operator like ""in the next state"" is explicit):

1. C1: event1 AND event2. No state has both true simultaneously (S0 has event2, S1+ have event1). So C1 is false in every state.
2. C2: (C1 → event1). Since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true. So C2 is true in every state.

1. From the context: states alternate between event1 and event2, starting with event1 in the initial state. So the sequence is event1 (initial), event2 (next), event1, event2, ...

2. C1 and C2 and C5 are the same proposition: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., the current state is an event2 state). That is false in the initial state (because initial state has event1) and true in the next state (where event2 holds).

3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., eventually there is a state where event1 does not happen. That is true because the next state is event2 (so C2 holds there). Thus C3 is True.

4. C4 is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"". C3 is true, but C1 is false in the initial state, so C4 is false at the initial state.

5. C6 is ""C4 or C5"". In an event1 state (like the initial state), C5 (""event1 does not happen"") is false and C4 is false, so C6 is false in event1 states. In event2 states C5 is true, so C6 is true there. Therefore C6 is not true in all states.

6. C7 is ""C6 always holds"" (i.e., C6 holds in all future states). Since C6 fails in event1 states, C7 is false (it does not hold from an event1 state).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context, the system alternates: initially event1; after event1 must come event2; after event2 must come event1. So states alternate event1, event2, event1, ...
2. Interpret formulas statewise and ""eventually"" as ""now or in the future"".
3. C1 and C2 are both the same proposition: (event1 -> event2).
   - In an event1 state this implication is false (event1 true, event2 false).
   - In an event2 state it is true (event1 false, implication vacuously true).
4. C3 = (event1 and C2). That is false in every state:
   - In event1 states C2 is false, so C3 false.
   - In event2 states event1 is false, so C3 false.
5. C4 = C1 or C3. Thus C4 is true exactly in event2 states (because C1 true there), and false in event1 states.
6. C5 = eventually C4. From any state, C4 holds at the next or current state (from event1 it holds next at event2; from event2 it holds now), so C5 is true in every state.
7. C6 = (if C5 then event1). Since C5 is true everywhere, C6 requires event1 to be true in every state. But event1 is false in event2 states, so C6 is false in event2 states.
8. C7 = always C6 (C6 holds in every state) is therefore false. Consequently C8 and C9 (repeating ""always"") are also false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the system stays in event1 forever (event1 holds in all states).
- Event2 never occurs.

Evaluate the listed formulas at the initial state:

1. C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — false (event1 does happen).
2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (always ¬event1) — false (initially ¬event1 is false).
3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — true, because C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
4. C4: ""Event1 does not happen"" — same as C1 → false.
5. C5: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — same as C3 → true.
6. C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" → false AND true = false.
7. C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds"" — C3 is true while C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - s0 (initial): event1 occurs.
   - After event1, event2 must happen, so s1: event2.
   - After event2 no other events can happen, so every future state s1, s2, ... has event2 (stays at event2).

2. Evaluate the formulas at states:

   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 this requires event1 at s1, but s1 has event2, so C1 is false at s0. At any s>=1 the next state also has event2, so C1 is false at all states.

   - C2: same as C1, so false everywhere.

   - C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" (event1 -> C2). This is true at any state where event1 is false (vacuously true). At s0, event1 is true, but C2 is false at s0, so C3 is false at s0. For s>=1, event1 is false so C3 is true.

   - C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" At s0 event1 is true, so C4 true at s0. At s>=1, C3 is true (vacuously) so C4 true there as well. Thus C4 is true at all states.

   - C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true everywhere, C5 is false everywhere.

   - C6: ""C1 and C5."" Both C1 and C5 are false everywhere, so C6 is false at every state.

   - C7: ""Eventually C6 holds."" Since C6 is never true, C7 is false.

   - C8: ""C7 holds and event2 happens."" C7 is false everywhere, so C8 is false at every state (even where event2 holds).

   - C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" For C9 to hold at s0, C8 must hold at s1, but C8 is false at s1. So C9 is false (and in fact false at all states).

3. Conclusion: C9 is False."

- But C6 at an event1-state requires next(event2 → event1). The next state is an event2-state, where (event2 → event1) is false (event2 true, event1 false). Thus C6 fails at every event1-state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 is true, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays at event1 in the initial and all future states.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication and is true in every state (in particular true now because event1 is true). So C1 holds.

3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 also holds.

4. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C2 is true, so C3 requires event2. But whether C3 holds depends on whether event2 occurs. In our run event2 never happens (we remain at event1), so C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is false now and the next state is also event1 (same situation), C3 is false in the next state as well, so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" C1 holds, so C5 is true.

7. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" C5 is true, and event1 indeed happens (always), so C6 holds (true now).

8. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 holds now, it is true that C6 eventually holds, so C7 is true.

3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 is never true in any future state, C2 is false.
4. C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" — negation of false, so C3 is true in every state.
5. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" — true, because the next state is identical and C3 is true there.

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event2 is true.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → once in event2, all future states remain event2.
   - After event1, event2 must happen → if event1 ever occurs, the next state must be event2.

2. From the context, event2 holds in the initial state and in every subsequent state. Event1 never occurs in any state (there is no transition to event1 from the initial event2, and event2 is absorbing).

3. Evaluate the hypothesis formulas:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 never happens, the implication is vacuously true. So C1 holds.
   - C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 is true and C1 holds, so C2 is true (in the initial state and indeed in every state).

   - s1: event1 = true, event2 = false (because after event2, event1 must happen).
   - s2, s3, ...: event1 = true, event2 = false (after event1 no other events can happen, so it stays at event1).

2. C1 and C3 are the same state formula: ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" (event1 → event2).
   - At s0 this implication is true (event1 is false).
   - At s1 and later it is false (event1 true, event2 false).

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., there exists a current or future state where C1 is true.
   - At s0 this is true (C1 holds at s0).
   - At s1 and later this is false (no future state from s1 has C1 true).

4. C4 = C2 ∧ C3.
   - At s0: C2 true and C3 (C1) true ⇒ C4 true.
   - At s1 and later: both parts are false ⇒ C4 false.

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 at s1 is false, C5 is false at s0. In fact C4 is false at every state >= s1, so C5 is false at all states.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds"" — false everywhere because C5 is false at every state.

8. C8: ""C7 always holds"" — false everywhere.

1. Context implies this unique trace: initial state S0 has event2; S1 has event1 (since after event2, event1 must happen); and from S1 onward it stays at event1 (after event1, no other events can happen).

2. C1 and C2: both assert ""event2 happens in the next state"" (relative to the state where they are evaluated). At S0 the next state is S1 which has event1, so event2 is false in the next state. Thus C1 = False and C2 = False at S0.

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since event2 never occurs in any future state (S1 and onward are event1), C2 never becomes true at any future state. So C3 = False at S0.

4. C4: ""C1 and C3"" is False AND False = False at S0.

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — C4 is also false at S1 (same reasoning), so C5 = False at S0.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds"" — since C5 is false at S0, C6 is False.

7. C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — since C6 is False, C7 is True at S0.

8. C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — C7 is also true at S1 (C6 remains false there), so C8 = True at S0.

1. From the context, the system starts with event1, and the rules force alternation: after event1 comes event2, after event2 comes event1, so the sequence of states is event1, event2, event1, event2, ...  
2. In this model, a single state has exactly one event true, so ""event2 and event1"" (a simultaneous conjunction) is false in every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event2, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore every state (initial and all future) has event2 true and event1 never occurs.

2. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because event1 never occurs.

3. C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is an implication with antecedent C1. Since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true. Thus C2 holds (in every state).

4. C3 and C4 (""C2 holds in the next state"") are both true because C2 holds in every state, so it certainly holds in the next state.

5. C5 (C3 or C4) is true (either disjunct is true).

6. C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true because C5 is true in every state.

7. C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is the negation of a true statement, so C7 is false.

Therefore, C7 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - s0 (initial): event2 is true.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → s1: event1 is true.
   - After event1 no other events can happen → s1 and all future states remain event1 true.

2. Evaluate C1 = (event1 → event2):
   - s0: event1 is false → C1 true (implication vacuously true).
   - s1+: event1 true and event2 false → C1 false.

3. C2 = (C1 → event1) (same as C7):
   - s0: C1 true but event1 false → C2 false.
   - s1+: C1 false → C2 true.

4. C3 = C2 ∧ event2:
   - s0: C2 false ∧ event2 true → C3 false.
   - s1+: event2 false → C3 false.
   - So C3 is false in every state.

5. C4 = ¬C3 → true in every state.
6. C5 = always C4 → true (C4 holds everywhere).
7. C6 = ¬C5 → false (everywhere).
8. C7 = same as C2; in particular at the initial state s0 C7 is false.
9. C8 = C6 ∨ C7:
   - At s0: C6 false and C7 false → C8 false at the initial state.

Context summary: initially event2 is true, and after event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen — so the system stays in event2 in all states.

1. C1: (event2 → event1). Since event2 is true and event1 is false in the initial (and all) states, C1 is false.
2. C2: (C1 → event2). The consequent event2 is true in every state, so this implication is true (even though C1 is false).

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so once in an event2 state, the system stays in event2 forever.
- (The rule about event1 is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.)

Hypotheses:
- C1 = ""event2 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event2 at a state).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future state ¬event2).
- C3 = ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" (C2 ∨ event2).
- C4 = ¬C3.
- C5 = ¬C3.
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 = ¬C3 ∧ ¬C3 = ¬C3.

Evaluate:
1. From the context, event2 is true in the initial state and, by the ""no other events"" rule, remains true in every future state.
2. So C1 (¬event2) is false in every state.
3. Therefore C2 (""eventually ¬event2"") is false.
4. C3 = C2 ∨ event2. Since event2 is true (in the initial and all states), C3 is true.
5. Thus C4 and C5 (both ¬C3) are false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 forever).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs here).

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: Event1 happens and event2 happens.
   - In every state at most one event holds; here event2 never occurs (we stay at event1 forever).
   - So C1 is false in all states.

2. C2: Event1 happens and event2 happens.
   - Same as C1, so C2 is false in all states.

3. C3: C1 holds or C2 holds.
   - Both C1 and C2 are false, so C3 is false.

4. C4: C3 eventually holds.
   - C3 is never true in any state, so ""eventually C3"" is false. Thus C4 is false.

5. C5: C4 holds in the next state.
   - C4 is false everywhere, so C5 is false.

6. C6: C5 holds in the next state.
   - C5 is false everywhere, so C6 is false.

7. C7: C6 does not hold.
   - Since C6 is false, C7 is true (C7 holds in every state).

8. C8: C7 always holds.

1. The context gives a single possible trace: initially event2, and after event2 no other events can happen — so the system stays at event2 forever (event1 never occurs). Also, after event1 event2 must happen, but event1 never happens so that rule doesn't activate.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (globally). In the actual trace event1 never happens, so C1 is False.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1. Since C1 is False, C2 is True.

4. C3: ""Event1 always happens"" — same as C1 — so C3 is False.

5. C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" = (C2 -> C3). Here C2 is True and C3 is False, so the implication is False. Thus C4 is False (in every state, because C1/C3 are global and false everywhere).

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X C4. Since C4 is False in every state, X C4 is False at the initial state. So C5 is False.

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" = F C5. Because C5 is False at every state, C6 is False.

8. C7: ""Event1 happens and C6 holds"" = event1 ∧ C6. Event1 is false (we're at event2) and C6 is False, so C7 is False.

9. C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" = X C7. Since C7 is False in every state, X C7 is False. So C8 is False.

Context (timeline):
- t0 (initial): event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so t1: event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so from t1 onward it stays at event2 (event1 is false for t >= 1).

Evaluate the subformulas at the initial state (t0):

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" — interpreted as (event2 -> event1) in the same state.  
   - At t1 (and all t >= 1) event2 is true but event1 is false, so C1 is false there. C1 is therefore not a globally true fact; at t0 specifically, event2 is false so C1 evaluates true at t0 vacuously, but we care about the later truth of dependent formulas below.

2. C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" = event1 OR (event2 -> event1).  
   - At t0: event1 is true, so C2 is true at t0.  
   - At t1 and thereafter: event1 is false and (event2 -> event1) is false, so C2 is false for t >= 1.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — at t0 this asks whether C2 holds at t1. C2 is false at t1, so C3 is false at t0.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C2 is false for all t >= 1, C3 is false at every state, so C3 never holds; therefore C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — negation of C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is true (it holds at t0).

6. C6: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this is the same as C3; at t0 it is false (because C2 is false at t1).

7. C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" At t0, C5 is true and C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: starting state s0 has event2. After event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So the system alternates: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false, because event1 holds in every other state.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 is false, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". So C2 is true exactly in the event2 states (s0, s2, ...).

- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — equivalent to ¬C2, so true exactly in the event1 states (s1, s3, ...).

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C4(s) = C3(s+1). Because the sequence alternates, s has next state of the opposite event. Thus C4(s) is true iff s+1 is an event1 state, i.e. iff s is an event2 state. So C4 is true exactly in event2 states (same set as C2).

- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — true in event2 states because C4 holds there, and true in event1 states because event1 holds there. So C5 is true in every state (a tautology across this trace).

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — since C5 already holds now (and everywhere), C6 is true in every state.

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — C6 holds now, so C7 is also true in every state.

- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — false in every state because C7 is true everywhere.

- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" — since C8 is false in every state, C9 is false in every state (including the initial state).

Therefore C9 is False."

1. From the context: initial state is event2. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs the system stays at event1 thereafter). Thus the possible timeline is:
   - t0: event2
   - t1: event1
   - t2: event1
   - ... (event1 forever after t1)

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This requires event2 at every time. In the timeline, event2 occurs only at t0, not at t1 onward. So C1 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (already false at t0 and in futures), C2 is false.

4. C3: same as C2 (given), so C3 is false.

5. C4: same as C1 (""Event2 always happens""), so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C5 is false.

7. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" At t1, C5 is still false, so C6 is false.

8. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" At t0 this requires C6 at t1, which is false, so C7 is false.

9. C8: ""C2 holds and C7 holds."" Both parts are false, so C8 is false.

1. From the context: initially event2, and after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2. C1 and C2 are ""Event2 does not happen"" — they are true in event1 states and false in event2 states. In particular C1/C2 are false in the initial state (which is event2).

3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" means ""from now on, event2 never happens"". That is false, because event2 occurs (right now and repeatedly in the future). So C3 never holds.

4. C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 never holds at any future point, C4 is false.

5. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" — since C4 never holds, C5 is false.

6. C6 = C1 AND C5 — since C5 is false, C6 is false.

7. C7 = C6 AND event2 — C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the only possible execution trace is:
   - state0: event2 (initial)
   - state1, state2, ...: event1 forever (after event2 must come event1, and after event1 no other events can happen)

2. Evaluate the relevant subformulae at the initial state (state0) and the next state (state1):
   - C1 / C2 / C8: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At state0 the next state is state1 which has event1, not event2. So C1, C2, C8 are false.
   - C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" At state1 event1 holds but C2 is false there, so the implication is false at state1 (vacuously true at states where event1 is false, but false at the states where event1 actually holds).
   - C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" At state1 event1 holds but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false at state1, C5 is false.
   - C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" At state1 event1 is true, so C6 is true at state1.
   - C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" At state1 C1 is false but C6 is true, so C7 is true at state1.

3. C9 is ""C7 holds and C8 holds."" Because C8 is false (event2 does not occur in the next state), C9 is false regardless of C7.

Therefore C9 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system alternates: initial state S0 has event2; next S1 has event1; next S2 event2; and so on (event2, event1, event2, ...).

2. C1 and C2 are the same: ""Event1 happens in the next state"". This is true exactly in states where the current event is event2 (S0, S2, ...), and false in states where the current event is event1 (S1, S3, ...).

3. C3 (and C7, which is identical) is ""event2 now or C2 holds"". That is true exactly in states where the current event is event2 (because then event2 now is true); it is false in states where the current event is event1.

4. C4 is the implication C1 -> C3. Whenever C1 is true (current event2), C3 is also true (current event2), and when C1 is false the implication is vacuously true. So C4 holds in every state.

5. C5 (""C4 always holds"") is therefore true.

6. C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is the negation of a true statement, so C6 is false.

7. C8 is the conjunction C6 and C7. Since C6 is false, the conjunction is false (even though C7 may be true in some states, e.g. the initial state).

Thus C8 is False."

- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 thereafter).

Evaluate the named conditions (all are state formulas evaluated at a given state; ""eventually"" means true at some future state):

1. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state (event2), the next state is event1, so C1 is true at the initial state. More generally C1 may vary by state, but we only need the logical relations below.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event2 is true and after event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen — so the system stays in states where event2 is true (event1 never occurs anywhere starting from the initial state). Also, as in the examples, only one event can be true in a single state, so event1 and event2 cannot be true simultaneously.

2. C1: ""Event2 and event1"" — impossible in one state, so C1 is false.

3. C2 and C7: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" At the initial state event2 does happen but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 and C7 are false.

4. C3: same as C1, so false.

5. C4: ""If C2 holds then C3 holds."" Since C2 is false, this implication is vacuously true. So C4 is true.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" The next state (and all future states) still have event2 and the same truth values, so C4 remains true there. Thus C5 is true.

7. C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" C5 is true, so C6 is true.

8. C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" C6 is true but C7 is false, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event2, and after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So the system deterministically alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2. C1 and C5: ""Event2 does not happen."" These are false in any state where event2 holds (true in event1 states, false in event2 states).

3. C2 and C3: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). From any state (including the initial event2), the next state or current state includes an event1 state where event2 does not happen. So C2 and C3 hold at every state (there is some state now or in the future with not event2).

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3). Since C3 is true at every state, F C3 is true at every state (it already holds now). Thus C4 holds everywhere.

5. C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" is the implication C4 -> C5. Because C4 is true everywhere, C6 is equivalent to C5. But C5 (""not event2"") is false at event2 states, so C6 is false at those event2 states.

6. C7: ""C6 always holds"" (G C6) is false, because C6 fails at event2 states.

7. C8: ""If C2 holds, then C7 holds."" C2 does hold (we showed it holds at the initial state), but C7 does not hold. Therefore the implication is false.

Thus C8 is False."

3. C2 and C3 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") are true: the antecedent (event2) is true, and C1 is true, so the implication holds.

4. C4 (C2 and C3) is true, hence C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true (indeed C4 holds immediately), and C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true as well.

5. C7 (""If C6 holds, then event1 happens""): the antecedent C6 is true, but event1 does not occur (the path stays at event2), so C7 is false.

Context summary: Initially event2. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... — both event1 and event2 occur infinitely, starting with event2.

Now the formulas:

- C1: event2 AND event2 — equivalent to event2. So C1 holds exactly in states where event2 holds (in particular the initial state and every other event2 state).
- C2: If C1 then event2, i.e. (C1 → event2). Since C1 is event2, whenever C1 is true event2 is true; and whenever C1 is false the implication is true. So C2 is true in every state (a tautology here).
- C3: If event2 then C2, i.e. (event2 → C2). Because C2 is true in every state, C3 is true in every state.
- C4: event2 AND event2 — same as C1, i.e. event2.
- C5: C3 OR C4. C3 is always true, so C5 is true in every state.
- C6: C5 holds in the next state (X C5). Because C5 is true in every state, X C5 is true in every state, so C6 is true in every state.

1. Initially event2 is true, and after event2 no other events can happen — so every state (initial and future) has event2 true and event1 never occurs.

2. C1 = (event1 AND event2). Because only one event can be true in a state, event1 and event2 cannot be true together, so C1 is always false.

3. C2 = (C1 OR event1). With C1 false, C2 reduces to event1, which is false (event1 never occurs).

4. C3 = (C2 AND event1). Since C2 is event1, C3 is equivalent to event1, so C3 is false.

5. C4 = (event2 AND C3). This would require event2 and event1 in the same state, impossible, so C4 is false.

6. C5 = (C2 AND event1) — same as C3 — false.

7. C6 = (C4 AND C5) — false (both conjuncts false).

8. C7 = ""C6 always holds"". C6 is false (including at the initial state), so it does not always hold.

Context summary (reachable trace):
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so it stays at event1 thereafter).

So the only execution: initial state = event2, next = event1, then event1 forever.

Evaluate the Ci:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At the initial state the next state is event1, so C1 is false there. (C1 is false in every state: from event2 the next is event1; from event1 the next is event1 — never event2.)

2. C2 = ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

3. C3 = ""C2 always holds."" False (because C2 is false).

4. C4 = ""C3 always holds."" False.

5. C5 is the same as C1, so false.

6. C6: ""If C4 holds then C5 holds."" Since C4 is false, this implication is vacuously true — C6 holds in every state.

7. C7: ""If C6 holds then event2 happens."" Because C6 is true, C7 is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Thus C7 is true only in states where event2 holds (true in the initial state, false in the event1 states).

8. C8: ""C7 always holds."" This is false, because C7 fails in the event1 states.

9. C9: ""Event1 happens or C8 holds."" In the initial state event1 does not happen, and C8 is false, so the disjunction is false.

1. The context forces an alternating sequence of events starting from the initial state:

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 is true, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system is stuck at event1 forever (every state has event1 and stays event1).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false, because the initial state already has event1 (not event2) and event2 never occurs.

3. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.

4. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — true, because C2 is false and a false antecedent makes the implication true.

5. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — true (both disjuncts are actually true: C3 true, and event1 is true in every state).

6. C5: same as C1, so false.

7. C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — true (because C4 is true).

8. C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds"" — false (C1 is false).

9. C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — false, because C7 is false in every state.

10. C9: ""C8 always holds"" — false, since C8 is not true in any state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From context the system alternates: t0 event1, t1 event2, t2 event1, ... so event1 holds exactly at even steps and never two steps in a row.
2. C1 = (event1 or event1) = event1.
3. C2 = Next(C1) = Next(event1) (true exactly at states whose next state has event1).
4. C3 = C2 AND event1 = event1 AND Next(event1). Because event1 never holds in two consecutive states, C3 is false at every state.
5. C4 = not C3, therefore C4 is true at every state.
6. C5 = Next(C4) is true at every state (since C4 is always true).
7. C6 = always C5 (G C5) is true (C5 holds at every state).
8. C7 = event1 OR C6 is therefore true at every state (C6 true).
9. C8 = not C7 is false at every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- System trace given the context: s0: event2; s1: event1; s2, s3, ...: event1 (after event1 no other events can occur).
- Interpret each Ci as a state formula (implication/event truth in the same state) and ""holds in the next state"" referring to the immediate successor.

1. C1 is (event1 → event2). In any state where event1 is true and event2 is false, C1 is false. At s0 (event2) C1 is true (antecedent false). At s1 (event1) C1 is false.
2. C2 and C3 are the same as C1, so same truth values.
3. C4 = C2 ∨ C3, so at any state it has the same truth value as C2 (hence false at s1, true at s0).
4. C5 = “C4 holds in the next state.” At s0, the next state is s1 where C4 is false, so C5 is false at s0.
5. C6 = (event1 ∨ C5). At s0 both are false, so C6 is false at s0. At s1 event1 is true, so C6 is true at s1.
6. C7 = (C6 ∧ event1). Thus false at s0, true at s1.
7. C8 = (C1 ∧ C7). At s1 C7 is true but C1 is false, so C8 is false at s1. At s0 C1 is true but C7 is false, so C8 is false at s0.
8. C9 = (event1 ∨ C8). At the initial state s0 event1 is false and C8 is false, so C9 is false at s0. (C9 is true at s1 because event1 is true there, but the question concerns the initial evaluation.)

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 occurs the system stays at event1 forever.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs here).

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""  
   - Every state in the trace has event1 true, so C1 is true in every state.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""  
   - Since the next state also has event1 true, C1 holds in the next state. So C2 is true (in every state).

3. C3: ""C1 holds in the next state.""  
   - C3 is identical to C2, so C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds.""  
   - C3 holds at every state, so C4 is true.

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""  
   - Since C4 holds everywhere, it holds in the next state as well, so C5 is true.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds.""  
   - C5 holds at every state, so C6 is true.

7. C7: ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" (implication C2 → C6)

Reasoning:
- Timeline from the context: initial state = event2; after event2 → event1; after event1 → stays at event1 forever.
- At the initial state: event2 is true, so C1 (""not event2"") is false there. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false at the initial state (always includes the current state).
- C3 = C2 and event1 is false at the initial state.
- Consider the next state (state1): event1 is true and event2 never occurs from that point on, so C2 is true at state1. Therefore C4 (= C3) is true at state1.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" is true at the initial state because C4 is true in state1.
- Thus at the initial state C6 = C3 or C5 is true (due to C5), so C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" is false."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- System transitions: initially event1. After event1 no other events can happen → event1 holds forever (self-loop). After event2 the next state would be event1, but event2 never occurs here.
- So for every state: event1 = true, event2 = false.

Evaluate the Ci:
- C1 = ¬event1 → false (since event1 is true).
- C2 = “C1 in the next state” → false (next state still has event1).
- C3 = same as C2 → false.
- C4 = C3 ∧ event2 → false ∧ false = false.
- C5 = always(C4) → false (C4 is already false now).
- C6 = “C5 in the next state” → false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initial state s0 has event1. After event1, event2 must happen, so s1 (the next state) has event2. After event2 no other events can happen, so all future states remain event2 (s1, s2, ... all have event2).

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 this is true (s1 has event2). At any state with event2 it is also true because event2 persists, so C1 holds whenever needed.

3. C2 and C3: both are ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" At s0 event2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; at s1 (and thereafter) event2 is true and C1 is true (next state also event2), so the implication is true there too. Thus C2 and C3 hold in all states.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 already holds immediately, C4 is true in every state.

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" At s0 the next state s1 satisfies C4, so C5 is true at s0; at s1 the next state also satisfies C4, so C5 is true at s1 as well.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 holds at all relevant states, C6 is false everywhere.

7. C7: ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" C2 holds but C6 is false, so the implication is false in all states (true -> false yields false).

8. C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" Because C7 is false in s0 and in every future state (only s1 repeats), C7 never holds, so C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False."

1. Timeline from the context:
   - S0 (initial): event1 true.
   - After event1 must come event2, so S1: event2 true.
   - After event2 no other events can happen, so from S1 onward it stays event2 (S2, S3, ... all event2).

2. Simplify repeated conjuncts: C1, C2, C5, C8 all reduce to ""event2"" (event2 AND event2 = event2).

3. C3 is (event1 → C2) i.e. (event1 → event2). At S0 event1 is true but event2 is false, so C3 is false at S0. At S1 C3 is true (antecedent false).

4. C4 is (C1 → C3) i.e. (event2 → (event1 → event2)). At S1 event2 is true and C3 is true (vacuously), so C4 is true at S1. C5 is event2, true at S1. Thus C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is true at S1.

5. C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state."" At S0 the next state is S1 where C6 is true, so C7 is true at S0.

6. C8 is event2; at S0 event2 is false.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2.
- From event2, event1 must happen next.
- From event1, no other events can happen (so it stays at event1 forever).

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" That means event2 holds in every future state. This is false (initially event2, but the next and all later states are event1).

2. C2: same as C1, so false.

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That asks whether there is some future state from which event2 holds in all states thereafter. There is no such state (after the initial event2, the system moves to event1 and stays there), so C3 is false.

4. C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true. So C4 is true.

5. C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" At the initial state event1 does not happen, but C4 is true, so C5 is true (at the initial state).

6. C6: same as C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") — false.

7. C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" At the initial state C5 is true and C6 is false, so this implication is false at the initial state.

8. C8: ""C7 always holds."" Because C7 is already false at the initial state, C8 is false.

1. From the context: the system starts in a state where event2 is true, and after event2 no other events can happen — so it stays in event2 forever. (Similarly, after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 is not reachable from the initial state.)

2. C1 = (event2 or event1). Since event2 is true in the initial state (and in every subsequent state), C1 is true in every state.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so every next state from an event1 state is again event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs here).

Interpretations:

- C3 = event1 → C2.

Evaluation:
1. Initially event1 is true, so C1 (¬event1) is false now.
2. From an event1 state the next state is event1 again, so in the next state C1 is also false. Thus C2 (next ¬event1) is false at every state.
3. Since event1 is true and C2 is false, C3 (event1 → C2) is false at every state.
4. Therefore C4 (eventually C3) is false, so C5 = ¬C4 is true at every state.
5. Hence C6 (next C5) is true (next state also has C5 true).
6. Thus C7 (eventually C6) is true.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to event1. So C1 ⇔ event1.

3. C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" ⇒ event2 ∨ event1. In our run event2 is always true, so C2 is true in every state.

4. C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" ⇒ event1 ∨ (event2 ∨ event1) ⇒ event1 ∨ event2. Since event2 always holds, C3 is true in every state.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds"" (G C3). Because C3 is true in every state, C4 is true.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4). Since C4 holds in every state, it also holds in the next state, so C5 is true.

7. C6: ""C5 does not hold"" ⇒ ¬C5. Because C5 is true, C6 is false.

8. C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens"" ⇒ false ∨ event1 ⇒ event1. So C7 ⇔ event1.

9. C8: ""C7 eventually holds"" ⇒ eventually event1. But event1 never occurs (the system stays in event2), so C8 is false.

10. C9: ""C8 always holds"" (G C8). Since C8 is false (in fact false at every state), C9 is false.

1. The context forces strict alternation: starting initially at event2, the next state must be event1, then event2, then event1, ... forever.
2. C1 = ""Event2 and Event1"" requires both events to hold in the same state. Given the model (one event per state, alternation), that can never happen, so C1 is always false.

Context trace:

  state0: event2
  state1: event1
  state2: event2
  state3: event1

Interpret the Ci in each state (propositions like ""Event1 does not happen"" mean event1 is false in that state):

1. C1: ¬event1.
   - True at state0 (event1 is false), false at state1 (event1 true), and alternates accordingly.

2. C2: same as C1 (¬event1).

3. C3: event2 ∧ C2 = event2 ∧ ¬event1.
   - True exactly in states where event2 holds (state0, state2, ...) and false in the event1 states.

4. C4: C3 always holds (G C3).
   - This is false at every state because C3 fails in the immediately following state (the system alternates), so there is no suffix where C3 is true at every future state.

5. C5: C4 eventually holds (F C4).
   - False, because C4 never holds at any future point.

6. C6: C5 does not hold = ¬(F C4).
   - True at every state (since F C4 is false everywhere).

7. C7: C6 eventually holds (F C6).
   - True at every state (C6 already holds now, and at every future state).

8. C8: C1 ∧ C7 = ¬event1 ∧ (F C6).
   - At state0: ¬event1 is true and C7 is true, so C8 is true at state0.
   - At state1: ¬event1 is false (event1 holds), so C8 is false at state1.

9. C9: C8 holds in the next state (X C8).

1. States: s0 is initial with event1 true. After event1, no other events can happen, so the system stays at event1 in all future states (s1, s2, ... all have event1 true). Similarly, if event2 occurred it would also be a terminal self-loop, but event2 does not occur initially.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- System behavior: initially event1. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the states alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

- Interpret propositions as state formulas:
  - C1 = (event2 -> event1) evaluated in a single state.
  - C2 = C1 ∧ event1 (current state).
  - C3 and C4 are identical to C2.
  - C5 = C3 ∨ C4, so C5 is equivalent to C2.
  - C6 = X C5 (C5 holds in the next state).
  - C7 = C2 ∧ C6.

- Evaluate in the initial state (event1):
  - event1 is true.
  - C1 is true (implication holds vacuously because event2 is false).
  - Therefore C2 is true in the initial state.

- Evaluate C6 (X C5) at the initial state:
  - The next state is event2.
  - In an event2 state, event1 is false, and C1 is false (because event2 true but event1 false), so C2 (and hence C5) is false in that next state.
  - Thus C6 is false at the initial state.

- Therefore C7 = C2 ∧ C6 is false (true ∧ false = false). Because the system deterministically alternates, there is no state where both C2 holds and C5 holds in the next state. Hence C7 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — true at the initial state (next state is event1).
3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is true at the initial state.
4. event2 is true at the initial state (given).
5. C3: C2 holds and event2 happens — true at the initial state (C2 true and event2 true).
6. C5: C2 holds and event2 happens — same as C3, so true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - State0 (initial): event1 true, event2 false.
   - After event1, event2 must happen → State1: event2 true.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → State1 and all future states: event2 true, event1 false.

2. C1 = (event1 or event2).
   - True in State0 (event1) and in all later states (event2).

3. C2 = (if C1 then event1) ≡ (event2 ⇒ event1).
   - In State0: event1 true, so C2 holds.
   - In State1: event2 true while event1 false, so C2 fails in State1.

4. C3 = “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 already holds in State0, C3 is true (it holds immediately).

5. C4 = “C3 eventually holds.” C3 is true at State0, so C4 is true.

6. C5 = “C2 eventually holds.” Same as C3, so C5 is true.

7. C6 = C4 and C5. Both true, so C6 is true (at State0).

8. C7 = (if C6 then event2) ≡ (C6 ⇒ event2).
   - At State0, C6 is true but event2 is false, so the implication is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context the states alternate: initial state s0: event2. Then s1: event1. Then s2: event2, etc.
2. We evaluate C9 at the initial state s0. C9 = (event1) or C8. In s0 event1 is false, so C9 reduces to C8.
3. C8 is ""C7 does not hold"" so we check C7 at s0. C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" — the next state from s0 is s1.
4. In s1 event1 is true. C6 = ""event1 or C5"" is therefore true in s1 (because event1 holds).
5. Thus C6 holds in s1, so C7 holds in s0. Therefore C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is false in s0.

   - State 1: event1 must happen (so event1 true).
   - State 2 onward: after event1 no other events can happen, so event1 remains true forever.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event1 at the current state).
   - C1 is true at State 0 (event1 is false).
   - C1 is false at State 1 and thereafter (event1 is true).

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1.
   - C2 is false at State 0 (because C1 is true there).
   - C2 is true at State 1 and thereafter.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G C2).
   - Since C2 is false at State 0, C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = ¬C3.

6. C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬C4.

- C1 (""event1 in the next state""): next state always has event2, so C1 is false in every state.
- C2 (""if event2 then C1""): since event2 is true and C1 is false, C2 is false in every state.
- C3 (""C2 always holds""): C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C2, so false.
- C5 (""if C3 then C4""): antecedent C3 is false, so the implication is true (C5 holds).
- C6 (""C5 does not hold""): since C5 holds, C6 is false.
- C7 (""event2 and C6""): event2 true but C6 false, so C7 is false in every state.

- After event2, no other events can happen → All states ≥1 have event2 true and event1 false.

Evaluate each Ci:

1. C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This requires event1 in every state. It's true in state0 but false in all later states. So C1 is false.

2. C2: same as C1, false.

3. C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" At state0 event1 is true while C2 is false, so the implication is false at state0. Thus C3 is false (it does not hold in the initial state).

4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" In state1, event1 is false, so the implication in C3 is vacuously true there. Hence C3 is true in state1, so C4 is true in the initial state.

5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" For every state, the next state's C3 is true (because from state1 onward event1 is false, so C3 holds everywhere >=1, and from state0 we already checked next state's C3 is true). Thus C5 is true.

Context (timeline):
- state0: event2 (initial).
- After event2, event1 must happen → state1: event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from state1 onward, event1 holds forever (state1, state2, ... all event1).

Now evaluate the conditions:

1. C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
   - From state0, next state is state1 (event1), so C1 is false at state0.
   - From any state with event1, the next state also has event1 (event2 never reoccurs), so C1 is false in every state.
   ⇒ C1 is always false.

2. C2 = ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" = event1 ∧ X event2.
   - Even when event1 is true (state1 onward), X event2 is false, so C2 is false in every state.
   ⇒ C2 is always false.

3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" = G C2.
   - Since C2 is always false, G C2 is false.
   ⇒ C3 is false.

4. C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" = F C3.
   - C3 never becomes true, so F C3 is false.
   ⇒ C4 is false.

5. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" = F C4.
   - C4 is never true, so F C4 is false.
   ⇒ C5 is false.

6. C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" = X C5.
   - C5 is false in every state, so X C5 is false in every state.
   ⇒ C6 is false.

7. C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" = F C6.
   - C6 never becomes true, so F C6 is false.

8. C8 = ""C7 always holds"" = G C7.

Reasoning step by step:

1. From the context: initial state s0 has event2. After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1 no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, the system stays at event1 forever). Thus the unique trace is:
   - s0: event2
   - s1: event1
   - s2, s3, ...: event1 (forever)

2. Evaluate the simple state formulas:
   - C1 = (event2) OR (event1). This is true in every state of the trace (true at s0 because of event2, true at s1+ because of event1).
   - C2 = C1 AND event2. Since C1 is true everywhere, C2 is equivalent to event2, so C2 is true exactly at s0 and false at s1, s2, ...

3. C3 = event1 AND C2. That requires event1 and event2 simultaneously in one state. That never happens, so C3 is false in every state.

4. C4 = event2 OR C3. Since C3 is always false, C4 reduces to event2, so C4 is true only at s0.

5. C5 = eventually C4. ""Eventually"" includes the current state. 
   - At s0, C4 holds at s0, so C5 is true at s0.
   - At s1 and later, there is no future state with event2, so C5 is false at s1, s2, ...

6. C6 = always C5. This requires that at every state in the suffix, C5 holds.
   - C5 is false at s1, so C6 is false at s0 (and in fact false at every state).

7. C7 = always C6. Since C6 is false everywhere, C7 is false everywhere.

8. C8 = event2 AND C7. C7 is false everywhere, so C8 is false in every state.

9. C9 = always C8. Because C8 is false (indeed false at s0), C9 is false.

Therefore C9 is False."

7. C5: ""C1 or C4."" Both false → C5 is False.
8. C6: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3 → False.
9. C7: ""C5 or C6."" Both false → C7 is False.
10. C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" C7 is false now and remains false, so C8 is False.
