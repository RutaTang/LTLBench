Reasoning (brief):
- From the context, event2 occurs at S0, then S1 has event1, S2 has event2, etc. So event2 does not hold in every state (it fails at S1, S3, ...). Therefore C1 and C2 (""Event2 always happens"") are false in every state.
- C3 and C4 are implications (C1 → C2). With C1 false, these implications are vacuously true, so C3 and C4 are true in every state.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is therefore true in every state.
- C6 says ""C5 holds in the next state"" — since C5 is true everywhere, C6 is true in every state.
- C7 says ""C6 holds in the next state"" — since C6 is true everywhere, C7 is true.

Thus C7 is True."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Thus the actual sequence is: event2 occurs initially, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth given the sequence)?
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the sequence both happen (event2 initially, event1 later), C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so true.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" With C2 true and C3 true, the implication is true (indeed C2 and C3 are the same formula here).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 holds immediately (and thus eventually), so C5 is true.
- C6: same as C2/C3, so true.

4) How these conditions relate to each other and final result
- C7 is ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Both C5 and C6 are true, therefore C7 is true.

Step 0 — assumption about ""must"": I treat ""After event1, event2 must happen"" as asserting that, given event1 happened, event2 indeed happens afterward.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (initially).
- From the context: after event1, event2 happens; after event2, no further events occur.

2) Transition rules
- event1 → event2 (if event1 happened, event2 happens afterward).
- event2 → no other events (once event2 has happened, nothing else happens).

So both event1 and event2 happen (in that order), and nothing happens after event2.

3) Meaning / simplification of each Ci
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to simply ""event2 happens."" So C1 ⇔ event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 ⇔ event2, C2 ⇔ (event2 and event2) ⇔ event2. So C2 ⇔ event2.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Because event1 happened, C3 is true (even without needing C2). So C3 = True.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 = True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 = True, C5 = False.
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" C5 is False, so C6 ⇔ event2. Given the context, event2 happens, so C6 = True.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" C3 is already True, so C7 = True (regardless of C6).

4) How they relate and final answer
- From the context event2 does occur, so C1 and C2 are true by simplification.
- C3 and C4 are true because event1 happened.
- C5 is false (negation of true C4).
- C6 is true because event2 happens.
- Therefore C7 (C3 or C6) is True.

Short answer: C9 is True (given the usual temporal reading below).

I'll walk through the four requested parts and then evaluate C1–C9.

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (time 0).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Hence, starting from the initial event1, the system will produce event2 next, then event1, then event2, ... — i.e. event1 and event2 alternate forever. In particular, event2 does occur (in fact infinitely often).

(Implicit temporal reading used below: “does not happen” means “never happens (at any time)”; “eventually” = at some future time; “always” = at all times.)

3) What each Ci means (and its truth value under the context)
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” (i.e. event2 never occurs). This is false, because transition rules force an event2 after the initial event1.
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: same as C1. False.
- C4: “If event2 happens, then C3 holds.” This is logically: event2 -> (event2 never happens). Since event2 does happen, the antecedent is true while the consequent (C3) is false, so the implication is false.
- C5: “C2 holds or C4 holds.” Both C2 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: “C5 eventually holds.” Because C5 is false at all times in this run, “eventually C5” is false.
- C7: “If C1 holds, then C6 holds.” C1 is false, so this implication is vacuously true; C7 is true.
- C8: “C7 holds or event1 happens.” C7 (a global implication) is true, so C8 is true (regardless of whether event1 happens at a particular time).
- C9: “C8 always holds.” Since C8 is true (and C7 remains true throughout the run), C8 holds at every time, so C9 is true.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary)
- C1–C3 assert that event2 never happens; the system forces event2, so these are false.
- C4 is an implication that would only be true in runs where event2 never happens; here it is false because event2 does happen and C3 is false.
- C5 and C6 depend on C2/C4 and are therefore false.
- C7 is an implication with a false antecedent, so it is true (vacuously).
- C8 is an OR where one disjunct (C7) is true, so C8 is true at all times.
- Therefore C9 (“C8 always holds”) is true.

If you intended a different temporal reading of “does not happen” (for example “does not happen now” rather than “never happens”), say so and I will re-evaluate under that interpretation.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Brief justification: from the initial event1 the rules force alternating event2/event1, so event2 does occur (C1–C3 false). That makes C4–C6 false, but C7 (""if C1 then C6"") is vacuously true. Hence C8 (C7 or event1) is true at all times, so C9 (""C8 always holds"") is True."

Summary answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 happened.
- Two rules from the context:
  a. After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events ever occur.)
  b. After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.)

Because event1 already happened initially and rule (a) forbids any further events after event1, event2 can never occur at any later time.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule (a) blocks any event after event1. Since event1 is already true initially, there are no possible later occurrences of event2.
- Rule (b) is a constraint: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur (after it). It does not force event2 to occur by itself.

3) Meaning of each Ci and evaluation
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False — event2 cannot happen (event1 already prevents any later events).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" True — this matches the given rule (after event2, event1 must happen). Also as a logical implication it would be vacuously true if C1 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Same as C1, so False.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" False, because C3 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" False — since C4 cannot become true at any time (it requires event2), C5 is false.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication is true (vacuously true) because C5 is false; an implication with a false antecedent holds.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" True — C6 is already true, so it certainly holds eventually.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" False — C7 does hold.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" True — since C8 is false, the statement ""C8 does not hold"" is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- The chain alternates between factual statements about events (C1, C3) which are false because event2 cannot occur, and implications whose truth often comes from vacuity (C6) or from the given rule (C2). That yields C7 true and C8 false, so C9 true.

Conclusion: C9 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Brief justification: event1 already happened and prevents any later events, so C1 and C3 are false. C2 is true (vacuously or by the rule). Hence C4 and C5 are false. C6 (""if C5 then event2"") is vacuously true, so C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true. C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is false, therefore C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true."

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from the initial state there is no next event).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ⇔ ""Event2 does not happen in the next state.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" ⇔ ""At every relevant state, event2 does not happen in the next state.""
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens.""
- C5: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" (identical to C4)
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" ⇔ C4 ⇒ C5.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C4 and C5 are syntactically the same formula (“C3 holds or event1 happens”).
- An implication P ⇒ P is always true (a formula implies itself).
- Therefore C4 ⇒ C5 is a tautology and is true in every possible case.
- Concretely, given the initial condition (event1 happened), C4 is true (because “event1 happens” holds), so C5 is also true — again making C6 true.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Two constraints: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So any state in which event1 or event2 has happened is terminal — no further events occur after that state.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event1 happened initially and it is terminal, there are no further events after the initial state. In particular, event2 does not occur anywhere (it cannot occur after event1).
- More generally, whenever either event1 or event2 occurs, the trace ends at that point.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (a material implication: event2 -> event1)
- C2: same as C1 (identical formula).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (written X C2).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" (C1 ∨ X C2).
- C5: same as C4.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" i.e. (C1 ∨ X C2) ∧ (C1 ∨ X C2). That simplifies to C1 ∨ X C2.

4) How they relate & truth value
- Because event2 never happens in any reachable state, the implication ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" (C1) is true vacuously in the initial state.
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction C1 ∨ X C2 is true regardless of X C2. Therefore C4 and C5 are true, and their conjunction C6 is true.
- (Optional note on X C2: there is no next state after the initial terminal state, so X C2 would be false under the usual semantics that X φ is false when no next state exists. That does not change the result because C1 is already true.)

Conclusion: C6 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.  
- Initially event1 has happened.  
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred there are no further event occurrences. Since event1 already happened initially, event2 cannot occur at any later time.  
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" states E2 → E1. This rule is moot here because, given the previous point, event2 never actually occurs.

So in propositional terms let E1 = ""event1 happens"" and E2 = ""event2 happens"". Given the narrative:
- E1 = True.
- E2 = False.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- E2 → E1 (if event2 happens then event1 must happen).
- Once E1 has happened, no other events can happen (so no occurrence of E2 after E1). With E1 true initially, E2 does not occur at all.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and evaluate them)?
Write each Ci in terms of E1 and E2 and evaluate under E1 = True, E2 = False.

- C1: E1 ∨ E2. Value: True ∨ False = True.
- C2: C1 ∨ E1. Value: True ∨ True = True.
- C3: E1 ∨ C2. Value: True ∨ True = True.
- C4: E1 ∨ E2 (same as C1). Value: True.
- C5: C1 ∨ E1 (same as C2). Value: True.
- C6: If C4 then C5, i.e. C4 → C5. Antecedent True, consequent True, so implication True.
- C7: If C3 then C6, i.e. C3 → C6. Antecedent True, consequent True, so implication True.

(Notes: C1 and C4 are identical; C2 and C5 are identical. Implications are True here because antecedents are True and consequents are True.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C8 true?
- C8 states ""C7 always holds."" We found C7 is True given the initial facts and rules. Therefore C8 is True.

Extra note on vacuous/trivial truth: Even if some antecedent were False, implications like C6 or C7 could be True vacuously; here they are True because both antecedents and consequents evaluate to True under E1 = True, E2 = False.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the system requires event1 following event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the system requires event2 following event1).
(That enforces an alternating pattern, starting with event2.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a proposition that at some state either event2 or event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some (possibly the current) future state C1 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — whenever C2 is true, event1 must occur.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — in the next state the statement C3 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — the same statement as C4 (as written, C4 and C5 are identical).
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" — C4 → C5.

4) How these conditions relate
- C4 and C5 are the same claim: both assert ""C3 holds in the next state.""
- C6 therefore has the form A → A where A is ""C3 holds in the next state.""

Conclusion about C6
- Any implication of the form A → A is a tautology (always true). Because C4 and C5 are identical, C6 is true in every possible state/model, independent of the event dynamics.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C4 and C5 are the same proposition (""C3 holds in the next state""), so C6 is an implication A → A, which is always true (a tautology). The event dynamics are irrelevant to this logical form."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is true that event2 occurred initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so event1 will happen at some later point).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen thereafter.
(These rules do not change the fact that event2 did happen initially.)

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. ¬event2)
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" (C1 ∨ C2)
- C4: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" (same as C3)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (¬C4)
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" (C3 ∧ C5)
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" (¬C6)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth evaluation
- From the initial condition, event2 did happen, so the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" is false. Therefore:
  - C1 = false
  - C2 = false
- C3 = C1 ∨ C2 = false ∨ false = false.
- C4 = same as C3 = false.
- C5 = ¬C4 = ¬false = true.
- C6 = C3 ∧ C5 = false ∧ true = false.
- C7 = ¬C6 = ¬false = true.

Final answer: C7 is True.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (call that state s0), event1 happened.
- I take ""after event1, no other events can happen"" to mean: from the next state onward (s1, s2, ...), no events occur (so in particular event2 never occurs anywhere after s0).
- I take ""after event2, event1 must happen"" to mean whenever event2 happens it forces event1 to hold in the required following position; this rule will be irrelevant because event2 never happens under the first rule.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event1 occurred in s0 and the system forbids any events after event1, no event (neither event1 nor event2) occurs in s1, s2, ... .
- Therefore event2 never occurs in any state s1, s2, ...

3) What each Cx means (interpreting ""in the next state"" as the usual next-state operator)
- C1: event1 happens in the next state (i.e., in s1).
- C2: event2 happens in the current state AND C1 holds.
- C3: same as C2 (duplicate).
- C4: C2 or C3 (so also requires event2).
- C5: event2 happens AND C4 holds (requires event2).
- C6: C5 does not hold (i.e., ¬C5).
- C7: C6 holds in the next state (i.e., in s1).
- C8: C7 holds in the next state (i.e., in s1's next state, s2).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Since no events occur in s1, s2, ... (by rule 1), event2 never occurs in any state. Thus any condition that requires event2 (C2, C3, C4, C5) is false in every state.
- Therefore C5 is false everywhere, so C6 = ¬C5 is true everywhere (including s0, s1, s2, ...).
- C7 says ""C6 holds in the next state"". Since C6 is true in every state, C7 is true in every state (in particular C7 is true in s0 because C6 is true in s1).
- C8 says ""C7 holds in the next state"". Because C7 is true in every state, C8 is true in s0 (C7 is true in s1), and more generally true everywhere.

Conclusion: C8 is True.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (state 0): event1 happened.
- Transition rules from the context: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So the system alternates: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, etc.
(I'm reading ""after X, Y must happen"" as a next-state temporal constraint.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- From any state where event1 occurs, the next state has event2.
- From any state where event2 occurs, the next state has event1.
Thus event2 occurs in the state immediately after any state where event1 occurred.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (This matches the context's ""after event1, event2 must happen""; so C1 is true under the given context.)
- C2: C1 does not hold. So C2 is the negation of C1; given the context C2 is false.
- C3: C1 does not hold. (Same as C2; false.)
- C4: C3 holds and event1 happens. Since C3 is false, C4 is false (even if event1 happens).
- C5: Event1 happens or C4 holds. Since C4 is false, C5 reduces to ""event1 happens"".
- C6: If C2 holds, then C5 holds. This is an implication. Its antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is true (material implication); thus C6 holds.
- C7: C6 holds and event2 happens. So C7 is true exactly in states where event2 happens (because C6 is already true).
- C8: C7 holds in the next state. This asserts that in the next state, both C6 holds and event2 happens.

4) How do these conditions relate and does C8 hold?
- Evaluate at the initial state (state0): event1 happened there. The next state (state1) must have event2 (by the context).
- In state1: event2 happens, and as argued C6 holds (because C2 is false). Therefore C7 is true in state1.
- C8 asserts that C7 holds in the next state (from state0), i.e., C7 holds in state1. That is true.

Therefore C8 is True.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 happened (call that state S0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs at some later state; for simplicity take it as S1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (states after S1 have no events).

So a possible timeline is: S0 (event1) → S1 (event2) → S2, S3, ... (no events).

2) Transition rules
- From S0 (where event1 has happened) the system must go to a state where event2 happens (S1).
- After S1 (event2), there are only states with no further events.

3) Meaning of each Ci (using usual temporal operators: X = next, F = eventually, G = always)
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (p → p). It is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 holds in every state, C2 is true in every state (the next state's C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold (see above), so C3 is false in every state.
- C4: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the same as C2, so C4 is true in every state.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" That is false because C3 is false (false ∧ true = false); so C5 is false in every state.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" (F C5). Since C5 is false now and remains false later, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" (G C6). Because C6 is false, C7 is false.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" (¬C7). Since C7 is false, ¬C7 is true.

4) How they relate
- C1 true ⇒ C2 and C4 true.
- C2 true ⇒ C3 false.
- C3 false ⇒ C5 false ⇒ C6 false ⇒ C7 false ⇒ C8 true.

Therefore C8 is True.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules (constraints)
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred at a state, no events occur in any later state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So whenever event2 occurs at some state t, event1 must occur at t+1.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., event2 at time 1).
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — that is, relative to the current state, at the next state C2 is true, so event2 would occur at time 2.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" (C1 -> C3).
- C5: same as C4 (duplicate).
- C6: C4 and C5 both hold.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" forbids any events at later states, event2 cannot occur at time 1 or at time 2. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (event2 does not happen next).
  - C2 is false (same).
  - C3 is false (C2 does not hold in the next state).
- C4 and C5 are implications with a false antecedent (C1 is false). In classical logic such implications are vacuously true.
- Therefore C4 = True and C5 = True, so C6 (C4 and C5) = True.

Conclusion: C6 is True.

- C2 = X C1 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false everywhere.
- C3 = not C2 is therefore true everywhere.
- C4 = (C3) or (event1) is true everywhere (because C3 is true everywhere).

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: Whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward (i.e., event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- Rule B: After event1 happens no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: no further events occur after it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (i.e. at some time/event1 holds)
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” (both event1 happens now and C1)
- C3: same as C2 (a duplicate): “Event1 happens and C1 holds.”
- C4: “C3 does not hold.”
- C5: same as C1: “Event1 eventually happens.”
- C6: “If C4 holds, then C5 holds.” (C4 ⇒ C5)
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” (next(C6))
- C8: “C2 holds or C7 holds.” (C2 ∨ C7)

4) How the conditions relate and truth values
- Since event1 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 is true (event1 happens AND C1), and C3 is true as it is identical to C2.
- Because C3 is true, C4 (“C3 does not hold”) is false.
- C5 is the same as C1, so C5 is true.
- C6 is the implication C4 ⇒ C5. An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true.
- C7 asserts C6 in the next state. Under the natural interpretation where there is a next state (even if no events occur there), C6 remains true in that next state, so C7 is true. (If one adopts an alternate semantics that treats “next” as undefined when there is no successor state, C7 might be undefined/false — however that does not matter for the final result, see next point.)
- C8 is C2 ∨ C7. C2 is already true, so the disjunction C8 is true regardless of the truth of C7.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial (current) state, event2 happened.

(Assumption used: ""after"" means ""in the next state"". This matches the hypothesis which uses ""next state"" for some Cs.)

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. So if event2 holds at a state s, then event1 holds at the immediately following state s+1.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 holds at a state, there are no subsequent events in later states (i.e., it is terminal).

Given the initial state has event2, the timeline is:
state0: event2
state1: event1 (forced by the rule)
no further events after state1.

3) Meaning of each condition
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (So this asserts event2 at state1.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (Globally: in every state, C1 is true.)
- C3: “Event2 happens and C2 holds.” (Conjunction at the current state: event2 here AND C2.)
- C4: same as C3 (identical formula).
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” (C3 → C4.)
- C6: “C5 always holds.” (Globally true: C5 holds in every state.)
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” (C6 is true at state1.)

4) How these relate and truth values
- C1: False. At state1 we have event1 (by the rule), not event2. So “event2 in the next state” is false.
- C2: False. “Always C1” is false because C1 is already false at the current point (an ""always"" claim that is false at one point is false).
- C3 and C4: False. C3 = (event2 here) AND C2. While event2 is true at the current state, C2 is false, so the conjunction is false. C4 is identical, so false as well.
- C5: True. C5 is the implication C3 → C4. Since C3 and C4 are identical, the implication is the tautology p → p, which is always true in every state (an implication with identical antecedent and consequent is always true).
- C6: True. Because C5 is true in every state (it's a tautology p → p), ""always C5"" holds.
- C7: True. C6 is true globally, so it certainly holds in the next state; therefore C7 is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True. C5 is the tautology C3 → C3, so it holds in every state; hence C6 (""always C5"") is true, and therefore C7 (C6 in the next state) is true."

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Two rules are given and (as stated) apply whenever the corresponding event happens:
  a) After event2, event1 must happen. (i.e. event2 → event1)
  b) After event1, event2 must happen. (i.e. event1 → event2)
- These rules force an alternating sequence: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

(Implicit assumption used below: these transition rules are persistent/global, i.e. they hold in every state where the antecedent event occurs.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (plain-language)
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (same as the first rule)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” (in the successor state, the statement C1 is true)
- C3: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (same as C1 again)
- C4: “C1 holds in the next state.” (same as C2 again)
- C5: C3 holds or C4 holds. (so C5 is true if either C3 or C4 is true)
- C6: If event1 happens, then C5 holds. (when event1 occurs, C5 is true)
- C7: C2 holds or C6 holds.
- C8: C7 holds in the next state. (in the successor state, C7 is true)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1: True by the given rule “After event2, event1 must happen.”
- C2: True because the rules are persistent; C1 is true in every state, so it is true in the next state as well.
- C3: Same as C1, so True.
- C4: Same as C2, so True.
- C5: C3 ∨ C4 is True (both disjuncts are true).
- C6: “If event1 happens then C5 holds.” Since C5 is already true independently, the implication C6 is true (a true consequent makes the implication true).
- C7: C2 ∨ C6 is True (both are true).
- C8: “C7 holds in the next state.” C7 is a global truth here, so it also holds in the next state. Therefore C8 is True.

Conclusion: Given the alternating rules and the initial event2, every listed condition evaluates to True, and in particular C8 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Brief justification: The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" makes C1 true (and by persistence true in every state), so C2 and C4 (C1 in the next state) are true as well. C3 equals C1, so C3 is true. Hence C5 = C3 ∨ C4 is true. That makes C6 (event1 → C5) true, and thus C7 = C2 ∨ C6 is true. Since C7 holds globally, it holds in the next state, so C8 is True."

Short answer: C8 is True.

Now step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the initial state (time 0).

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred at some time t, there are no further events at any future times > t. In particular, no event2 can occur after event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 ever occurs at time t, then event1 must occur at some time > t.

Combining these: event2 cannot occur at any time. It cannot occur before the initial state (initial state already has event1 and is the earliest state), and it cannot occur after event1 because no events are allowed after event1. Therefore event2 is impossible in the whole timeline.

3) What each Ci means and their truth values
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False (C2 is false now and nothing can make it true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False (C3 will never become true).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" True — an implication with a false antecedent (C1) is vacuously true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True — C5 is true now and remains true in every reachable state (no events can change facts that would make C1 true), so the 'always' condition holds.
- C7: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" True, because C6 is true (so the disjunction is true).

4) How they relate
- The impossibility of event2 makes C1, C2, C3, C4, and C7 false.
- The falsity of C1 makes the implication C5 vacuously true, and that truth persists (C6).
- Therefore C8 = C6 ∨ C7 is True.

Conclusion: C8 is True.

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So each event, once it has occurred, is terminal: no further events can occur after it.

From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2 no other events can happen"" we conclude event1 does not (and cannot) happen at any time after that. Under the ordinary reading (no simultaneous occurrences and no events before the initial moment), event1 did not happen.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: if either happens, no other events can happen afterward.
- Since event2 happened initially, that blocks any occurrence of event1.

3) What each sub-condition means (and truth value under the context)
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" — False (event1 does not happen).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — True (this implication is vacuously/tautologically true here because C1 and C2 are identical; in any case C1→C2 is true).
- C4: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" — False.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" — Since C3 is True and C4 is False, C5 is False.
- C6: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" — False.
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" — False ∨ False = False.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" — This asserts C7 is true; since C7 is false, C8 is False.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" — ¬C8 = True.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- Because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2, any condition asserting ""event1 happens"" is false. That cascades through the implications to make C5, C6, C7, C8 false and therefore C9 true.

Note on assumptions: this conclusion assumes no simultaneous occurrence of event1 with the initial event2 and that ""initially event2 happened"" excludes any prior event1. If you allow event1 to have happened simultaneously with event2 at the initial moment, the truth values could change (in that alternate reading C1/C2/C4/C6 could be true and then C9 could become false). Under the standard sequential reading above, C9 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Initially event2 occurred and both events are terminal, so event1 cannot occur. That makes C7 (and hence C8) false, so C9 (""C8 does not hold"") is true."

- C5 (C4 eventually holds): follows since C4 already holds.

- C1 (e1 → e2 as a state formula) holds vacuously in any state where e1 is false (e.g. initial state where e2 holds), so C1 holds at some state ⇒ C2 (""eventually C1"") is true.
- C3 (""if e2 then C2"") is true because whenever e2 holds, C2 holds (there will always be a future state where C1 holds).
- Hence C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false, so C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true in every state.
- Therefore C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true, and shifting this by next (C7, C8, C9) preserves truth.
- Thus C9 is True."

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at least initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 implies event1 occurs subsequently).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 implies event2 occurs subsequently).
These rules make event1 occur at least initially and force the two events to alternate thereafter; crucially, they forbid the situation “event1 never happens” because event1 already happened initially.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 does not happen (i.e. event1 is false / never happens).
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens = (not event1) AND event2.
- C3: same as C2 (explicitly the same: (not event1) AND event2).
- C4: event1 happens and C3 holds = event1 AND (not event1 AND event2) which is a contradiction, so C4 is false.
- C5: C4 does not hold = not C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: event1 happens or C5 holds = event1 OR C5. Because C5 is true, C6 is true.
- C7: C6 does not hold = not C6. Since C6 is true, C7 is false.
- C8: If C2 holds then C7 holds = (C2 → C7). An implication is true whenever the antecedent C2 is false, or when C7 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and does C8 hold?
- From the initial condition (event1 happened) C1 (“event1 does not happen”) is false. Therefore C2 = (C1 and event2) is false (C1 is already false), and likewise C3 is false. Because C2 is false, the implication C2 → C7 is vacuously true regardless of C7’s truth value.
- We already found C7 is false, but that doesn’t matter because the antecedent C2 is false, so the whole implication C8 is true.

Conclusion: C8 is True.

Reasoning (summary):

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen — so in the initial state C1 and C2 are true, hence C3 holds in the initial state.
- But after event1 no further events can happen, so in the state where event1 has occurred there is no next state; therefore ""event1 happens in the next state"" (C3) is false there. So C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.
- C6 (C4 -> C5) is then true (false antecedent makes the implication true). C7 (C6 -> event1 happens) therefore requires event1 to hold in the same state; in the initial state event1 does not happen (it happens in the next state), so C7 is false there. Hence C8 (""C7 always holds"") is false.

True

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context: event1 occurs initially, and the rules force alternation: after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1. So events will alternate indefinitely.
- C1: event2 eventually happens — True (it happens right after the initial event1).
- C2: event1 happens or C1 holds — True (event1 already happened).
- C3 and C4: If C2 holds then event2 happens — True (C2 holds and event2 does follow).
- C5: C3 or C4 — True.
- C6: C5 eventually holds — True (C5 holds now, so it certainly holds eventually).
- C7: C6 always holds — True, because the alternation persists and the predicates C1–C5 remain true at all times, so C6 holds at every moment.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Reasoning step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state (so at time 0, event2 is true).

(Assumption made: “happened” means the atomic proposition for that event is true in that state. Also I assume standard linear-time semantics where ""next"" refers to the immediate successor state; if there is no successor state the next-state formula is false.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs at some state, then at some future state event2 is true — and because of Rule B this future will be terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (i.e., a state with event2 is terminal: there is no successor state with any event).

Consequence: Since event2 already holds initially and event2 is terminal, no other events can occur at or after the initial state. In particular, event1 never occurs in any reachable state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value?
I will interpret each Ci as a temporal/propositional statement evaluated on the trace starting at the initial state.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the proposition (event1 ⇒ event1). That is a tautology (or vacuously true when event1 never occurs). So C1 is True in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now (it is true now), ""eventually C1"" is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is False now, ""always C3"" is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is False now, C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial (event2 is terminal), so under the usual convention a next-state formula is False when there is no successor. Thus C6 is False. (If one used three-valued/partial semantics you could phrase it differently, but under standard linear-time semantics it's False.)
- C7: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2, so C7 is True.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" That is False OR True = True.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- The crucial points are (a) C1 is trivially true, so any ""eventually C1"" is true; (b) that makes C2 and C7 true; (c) C3..C6 are false (C6 false because there is no next state); therefore the disjunction in C8 is True because of C7.

Therefore C8 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 (event1 ⇒ event1) is true in the initial state, so ""eventually C1"" (C2 and C7) holds immediately. C6 is false (no next state), but C8 = C6 ∨ C7 is therefore True because C7 is True."

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.
- Transition rules: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred (or event2 has occurred) there are no subsequent events in later states.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs in a state, then in the next state no event occurs (so event1 does not occur in that next state).
- Similarly, if event2 occurs in a state, then in the next state no event occurs.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1, so equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — this is p → p (with p = “event1 happens”), which is a logical tautology (always true).
- C4: again ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event1 holds in the next state.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds"".
- C7: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — same as C5.
- C8: ""If C6 holds, then C7 holds"" — i.e. C6 → C7.

4) How the conditions relate and truth values under the initial conditions
- In the initial state event1 happened, so C1, C2, and C4 are true in the initial state.
- C3 is a tautology, so C3 is true.
- Because ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event1 does NOT hold in the next state. Therefore C5 is false, and C7 (same as C5) is false.
- C6 = C3 ∧ C5 = true ∧ false = false.
- C8 is the implication C6 → C7. An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C8 is true.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 has happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After a state where event1 holds, event2 must happen at some later state (i.e. eventually event2).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal / no further different events occur).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just event2 (a redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. eventually event2.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" — event1 ∨ (eventually event2).
- C4: same as C3 (a duplicate).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" — (C3 → C4). Since C3 and C4 are identical formulas, this implication is always true in any state (p → p is a tautology).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — that states that the tautology C5 is true in the successor state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — for every state, C5 holds in the next state.

4) How they relate (why C7 is true)
- C3 and C4 are syntactically the same, so C5 = (C3 → C4) is true in every state.
- Therefore in every state the next-state claim ""C5 holds in the next state"" is true (because C5 is true in every state), so C6 is true in every state.
- Hence C7 (""always C6"") is true.

So C7 is True.

True

Reason: C3 and C4 are identical, so C5 = (C3 → C4) is always true. Hence C6 (X C5) holds in every state, and therefore C7 (G C6) is true."

Short answer: C7 is True (vacuously), given the stated initial/transition rules and the usual semantics where ""next"" is false at a terminal state.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.)
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes any state where event1 occurs a terminal state: there are no subsequent states/events after an occurrence of event1.

Because event1 happens initially, the system is already in a terminal state and there are no further states.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (Interpretation in standard temporal logic style)
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. This is true in the initial state because event1 happens initially.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (X C1). Since the initial state is terminal (no next state), X C1 is false (in standard semantics the ""next"" operator is false at a state with no successor).
- C3: same as C2 (also false).
- C4: C2 and C3, therefore false AND false = false.
- C5: C1 holds in the next state (same as C2/C3) — false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" (F C5). Since there are no future states in which C5 could hold, F C5 is false.
- C7: If C4 holds, then C6 holds (C4 → C6). An implication is true whenever its antecedent is false; since C4 is false, the implication is true (vacuous truth).

4) How do these conditions relate and conclusion?
- C4 is false, C6 is false, but the implication C4 → C6 is true because a false antecedent makes an implication true regardless of the consequent.
- Therefore C7 is True.

(If you use a different semantic convention where ""next"" at a terminal state is treated differently, the evaluation might change — but with the standard interpretation above, C7 is true.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: the initial state is terminal (event1 occurs and no successor), so C2–C5 are false, hence C4 is false. An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C7 holds (vacuously). This assumes the standard semantics where Xφ is false at a terminal state."

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: Initially, event1 happened.
- Additional constraints given: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen.""

From the initial condition and the ""after event1 no other events"" rule, event2 does not occur (because event1 already happened and prevents any further events).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs, then no other events can occur afterwards. So occurrence of event1 rules out any subsequent event, in particular event2.
- If event2 occurs, then no other events can occur afterwards. (This rule is moot here because event2 never occurs given the initial condition.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: (event1 → event2). If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: not(C1). C1 does not hold (i.e., it is false that event1 implies event2).
- C3: (event2 → C2). If event2 happens, then C2 holds.
- C4: C3 always holds. (C3 is true at all times.)
- C5: C4 always holds. (Redundant restatement; still true.)
- C6: C5 always holds. (Redundant; still true.)
- C7: C6 eventually holds. (There is some time at which C6 holds.)
- C8: C7 eventually holds. (There is some time at which C7 holds.)
- C9: C8 eventually holds. (There is some time at which C8 holds.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event1 happened initially and prevents any later events, event2 does not occur. Therefore C1 (event1 → event2) is false: event1 occurs but event2 does not, so the implication fails. Thus C2 = not(C1) is true.
- C3 is the implication (event2 → C2). Since C2 is already true, the implication event2 → C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true; also if event2 never occurs the implication is vacuously true). So C3 is true.
- C4, C5, C6 are repeated ""always holds"" statements about C3 / previous ones. Since C3 is true in the actual (and all reachable) states here, ""always"" versions are true as well.
- C7, C8, C9 are ""eventually"" statements about properties that in fact hold always. If something holds always, then it certainly holds at some time (standard temporal logic semantics treat the present as a valid witness for ""eventually""). Therefore C7, C8, and C9 are all true.

Possible semantic caveat: If your temporal logic interprets ""eventually"" as ""strictly in the future (not including the present)"" and the timeline has length 1 (no future moments), one might need to check that nuance. Under the usual LTL-style semantics where ""eventually"" means ""at some time k ≥ now"", the present truth suffices and the above conclusions hold.

Conclusion: Under standard semantics, C9 is True.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Below I’ll go step by step as you requested.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the initial time (so at the start of the timeline, event2 holds).

(Assumption: “eventually” means “at some time at or after the initial time” — i.e., occurrence now counts as eventually. This is the usual interpretation in temporal reasoning; if you prefer a strictly-future reading, I’ll note differences below.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur at some later time (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — once event1 happens, nothing else happens afterwards).

Given the initial event2, the rules imply that event1 will (or must) occur at some time after the start, and once it does, no further events occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” (True here because event2 happened initially.)
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” (A conditional: event2 ⇒ C1. This is true: if event2 happens, then indeed event2 eventually happens.)
- C3: “Event2 happens or C2 holds.” (Disjunction of the fact event2 happened and the true implication C2. True.)
- C4: “Event2 eventually happens.” (Same as C1. True.)
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” (Given C3 and C4 are both true, this implication is true.)
- C6: “C5 does not hold.” (Negation of C5. Since C5 holds, C6 is false.)
- C7: “C6 always holds.” (Requires C6 to be true at all times; since C6 is false, C7 is false.)
- C8: “C7 eventually holds.” (Since C7 is never true, C8 is false.)
- C9: “C8 eventually holds.” (Since C8 is never true, C9 is false.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? (stepwise evaluation)
- From the initial facts, C1 is true (event2 did occur).
- C2 is true because it’s the trivial implication “if event2 happens then event2 eventually happens.”
- C3 is true because event2 actually happened (and C2 is true anyway).
- C4 is the same as C1, so true.
- C5 is true because C3 implies C4 (both are true).
- C6 is the statement “C5 does not hold”; since C5 holds, C6 is false.
- C7 claims C6 is always true; because C6 is false, C7 is false.
- C8 (eventually C7) is false because C7 is never true.
- C9 (eventually C8) is false because C8 is never true.

Therefore C9 is False.

Note on the “strict future” reading: if you interpret “eventually” to exclude the present moment (i.e., require an occurrence strictly after the initial time), then C1 and C4 could be read false unless event2 repeats later. But the statement “After event2, event1 must happen” plus “initially event2 happened” guarantees event1 will happen later; that still doesn’t force event2 to happen again. Under that strict reading, C1 and C4 would be false, and the chain still leads to C9 being false. So under either interpretation, C9 is false.

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur next).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate indefinitely: event1 → event2 → event1 → …).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- C1: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. (This is a tautological implication p → p; true.)
- C2: same as C1. (True.)
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds. (Since C1 and C2 are both true, C3 is true.)
- C4: If C3 holds, then event2 happens. (C4 asserts: from the fact C3 to the occurrence of event2.)
  - C3 is true, and from the problem’s dynamics (event1 happened initially and after event1 event2 must happen) event2 does indeed occur, so C4 is true in this scenario.
- C5: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. (Same tautology; true.)
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds. (C5 is already true, so C6 is true regardless of C4.)
- C7: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. (Again a tautology; true.)
- C8: C6 holds or C7 holds. (Both C6 and C7 are true, so C8 is true.)
- C9: C8 eventually holds. (""Eventually holds"" means there exists some time at which C8 is true.)
  - C8 is already true (it holds now), so it certainly holds at some time — hence C9 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Many Ci statements are redundant tautologies (C1, C2, C5, C7).
- Those make C3 true; combined with the given event sequence (event1 then event2) makes C4 true.
- C5’s truth makes C6 true; with C7 true, C8 is true; therefore C8 holds now and thus ""eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Conclusion: C9 is True (indeed it holds immediately in this setup).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Brief justification: C1, C2, C5 and C7 are tautologies so they are true; hence C3 is true. Given the initial event1 and the rule that event2 must follow event1, event2 does occur, so C4 holds. C5 true makes C6 true, and C6 or C7 makes C8 true now — therefore C8 ""eventually holds"" is satisfied, so C9 is True."

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen.""

From these, because event1 happened initially, no other events can happen after that; so event2 does not occur at any time after the initial event. In the given scenario event2 does not happen.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- The rules ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen"" mean that whichever of the two events happens first prevents any further events. Here event1 has happened first, so event2 cannot (and did not) happen. (Whether an implication is vacuously true will be used below.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value?
Interpret implications as material implication.

- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. Formally event2 → event1.
  - Truth: True. Either because event2 does not happen (antecedent false → implication true), and also event1 actually happened so the implication is satisfied.

- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. Formally event1 → C1.
  - Truth: True. event1 does happen, and C1 is true, so the implication holds.

- C3: C2 does not hold. That is ¬C2.
  - Truth: False, because C2 is true.

- C4: C3 does not hold. That is ¬C3.
  - Truth: True, because C3 is false.

- C5: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. Same as C1.
  - Truth: True.

- C6: C4 holds and C5 holds. C4 ∧ C5.
  - Truth: True ∧ True = True.

- C7: Event1 happens or C6 holds. event1 ∨ C6.
  - Truth: True (event1 happens, and C6 is also true).

- C8: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. Same as C1/C5.
  - Truth: True.

- C9: If C7 holds, then C8 holds. Formally C7 → C8.
  - Evaluate: C7 is true and C8 is true, so the implication is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- Many conditions are repetitions of the same implication; the chain yields C1, C2, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8 all true, and C3 false.
- C9 is therefore True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True. C7 is true and C8 is true, so the implication C7 → C8 (C9) is true."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has happened, no further events occur thereafter.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur after it.)

Because event1 already happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 can never occur at any later time in this run, so the second rule is irrelevant here.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1, C2, C3: each asserts the same proposition: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (All three are identical claims.)
- C4: C2 or C3 (so C4 is true iff at least one of C2,C3 is true).
- C5: C2 or C3 (same as C4).
- C6: C4 and C5 (so C6 is true iff both C4 and C5 are true — equivalently iff at least one of C2,C3 is true).
- C7: If C1 then C6 (implication: C1 ⇒ C6).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the transition rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and the fact event1 already happened initially, no events occur in the next state. Therefore C1, C2, C3 (each claiming event1 happens in the next state) are false.
- If C2 and C3 are both false, then C4 = (C2 or C3) is false, and C5 likewise is false. Then C6 = C4 and C5 is false.
- C7 is the implication ""if C1 then C6."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Here C1 is false, so C7 is True.

Note about ambiguity: If one read ""no other events can happen"" as ""no events other than event1 can happen"" (i.e., event1 could repeat), then C1/C2/C3 could be true; in that reading C2 and C3 would also be true, making C4/C5/C6 true, so C1 ⇒ C6 would still be true. Thus under either natural interpretation, C7 is True.

Short answer: C9 is True.

I’ll go step-by-step as you requested. I assume standard linear-temporal logic (LTL) semantics where
- Fφ = “φ eventually holds”,
- Xφ = “φ holds in the next state” (and Xφ is false in a state that has no successor),
- Gφ = “φ holds in all current and future states”.
If you use a different semantics for X on terminal states, call that out and I can adapt.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Additional constraints: after event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal); after event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal, the system is in a state with no further transitions (a terminal state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 ever occurs, it is terminal — no further events after it.
- If event2 ever occurs, it is terminal — no further events after it.
- Since event2 has already occurred initially, there are no successor states.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (informal, using LTL reading)
- C1: “event2 eventually happens” (F event2).
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens” (F event2 ∨ event2).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” (X (C2)).
- C4: “event1 happens or C3 holds” (event1 ∨ X C2).
- C5: “event2 eventually happens” (same as C1).
- C6: “C4 holds or C5 holds” (C4 ∨ C5).
- C7: “C6 holds or event2 happens” (C6 ∨ event2).
- C8: “C7 always holds” (G C7).
- C9: “C8 always holds” (G C8).

4) How these conditions relate and their truth values in this model
Evaluate in the initial (terminal) state:

- C1: True. event2 has already happened, so “event2 eventually happens” is true.
- C2: True. It’s a disjunction; both disjuncts are actually true now.
- C3: False. X(C2) requires a successor state where C2 holds; there is no next state (terminal), so X(...) is false under standard LTL semantics.
- C4: False. It requires event1 now or C3; event1 did not happen and C3 is false.
- C5: True (same as C1).
- C6: True. C5 is true, so C4 ∨ C5 is true.
- C7: True. C6 is true (and event2 also is true), so C7 holds now.
- C8: True. G C7 holds because C7 holds in the current state and there are no future states in which it could fail (on this path, C7 holds at every state).
- C9: True. G C8 holds because C8 already holds in the only state(s); also note G G φ ≡ G φ, so nesting “always” does not change the truth value.

Conclusion: under the standard (finite-trace / LTL) interpretation as above, C9 is True. If you want me to re-evaluate under a nonstandard interpretation of X on terminal states, say so and I’ll redo the steps.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Brief justification: event2 holds in the initial (terminal) state, so F event2 is true and hence C5 (and C1,C2) are true. C3 = X C2 is false (no successor), so C4 is false, but C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is true and thus C7 is true in the only state. Therefore G C7 (C8) holds, and so G C8 (C9) holds. (This uses the given convention that Xφ is false in a state with no successor.)"

- C1 and C2 (event2 eventually happens) are true. Hence C3 (C2 and event1) and C4 (C1 or C3) are true. C5 (event2 or C4) is true at s0.
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state” is true at s0 because the next state s1 has event2 (so C5 holds there).
- C7: “C6 eventually holds” is true at s0 (it already holds).
- C8: “C7 holds in the next state” is false, because at s1 there are no further states in which C6 can hold, so C7 is false at s1.

- Initially event2 happens, and that forces event1 to happen later. After event1 no further events occur. So the run is: event2 (initial) → event1 (sometime) → nothing thereafter.
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false initially but becomes true after event1 (and remains true thereafter).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true (we will reach a state where event2 does not happen).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true (from every state we eventually reach a state where event2 does not happen).
- C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is therefore true.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false, so C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false, hence C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false.
- C8 (""C7 does not hold"") is true (in fact true at every state), and thus C9 (""C8 always holds"") is true."

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: event2 happened (at least at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen → interpret as the implication event2 ⇒ event1 (if event2 happens then event1 happens).
- After event1, event2 must happen → interpret as event1 ⇒ event2.
(We treat these as logical implications; timing/“after” just motivates the implications.)

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean and what are their truth-values?
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the given transition, so C1 is True.
- C2: C1 does not hold. This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False (since C1 is True).
- C3: Event1 happens and C2 holds. C2 is False, so the conjunction is False regardless of event1; therefore C3 is False.
- C4: C3 always holds. Because C3 is False, C4 is False.
- C5: C4 always holds. Because C4 is False, C5 is False.
- C6: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This is the same as C1, so C6 is True.
- C7: If C5 holds, then C6 holds. This is an implication whose antecedent C5 is False, so the implication is vacuously True. Thus C7 is True.
- C8: C7 always holds. Since C7 is True, C8 is True.
- C9: C8 holds and event2 happens. We have C8 = True and the initial condition event2 happened = True, so C9 is True.

(Notes on logic used: classical propositional logic. An implication with a false antecedent is True; a conjunction is True only if both conjuncts are True. “Always holds” was read as a global/necessary truth of the proposition.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C6 are the same implication derived from the given rules; they are true.
- C2 contradicts C1 and is therefore false.
- Any statement built using a false conjunct (like C3) or asserting that a false statement “always” holds (C4, C5) is false.
- Implications with a false antecedent (C7 because C5 is false) are true, which makes C7 true and hence C8 true.
- Finally, since C8 is true and event2 is given true, their conjunction C9 is true.

Conclusion: C9 is True.

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context the events alternate: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, ...
- Evaluate the Ci at the initial state:
  - C1: ""event2 in the next state"" — True (state1 has event2).
  - C2 = event1 or C1 — True (event1 holds now).
  - C3 = event1 or C2 — True.
  - C4 = C3 and event2 — False (event2 does not hold in the current state).
  - C5 = always C4 — False (C4 is already false now, so it cannot hold always).
  - C7 = (C5 -> C6) — True (implication with a false antecedent is true).
  - C8 = eventually C7 — True (C7 already holds).
  - C9 = ""C8 holds in the next state"" — True (C8 holds now and thus in the next state).

Short answer: C9 is True.

I'll show why step by step, using the usual temporal meanings: ""always"" = globally (G), ""in the next state"" = X, and ""does not hold"" = negation.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event1 has happened.
- Extra constraints from context:
  - Once event1 has happened, no other events can happen afterwards.
  - Once event2 has happened, no other events can happen afterwards.
  Because event1 has happened initially, the first constraint implies no other events (including event2) can ever occur in any state. So event2 is false in every state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- There is no explicit transition that makes event2 happen after s0 because the presence of event1 at s0 blocks any subsequent events. Effectively the timeline is: s0, s1, s2, ... with event2 false at every state.

3) What each Ci means (reading them as temporal formulas):
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" = G(event2).
- C2: same as C1 = G(event2).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = G(C2) = G(G(event2)).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X(C3).
- C5: ""If C1 holds then C4 holds"" = C1 → C4.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" = G(C5).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = ¬C6.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" = ¬C7.
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" = X(C8).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
Evaluate at the initial state s0 (and use s1 to evaluate next-state claims):

- Because event2 is false in every state:
  - C1 (G(event2)) is false at every state.
  - C2 is false.
  - C3 = G(C2) is false (C2 is false, so it cannot be true globally).
  - C4 = X(C3) is false at s0 because C3 is false at s1.
- C5 = (C1 → C4): an implication with a false antecedent is true. Since C1 is false, C5 is true in every state.
- C6 = G(C5): since C5 is true in every state, C6 is true.
- C7 = ¬C6: since C6 is true, C7 is false.
- C8 = ¬C7: since C7 is false, C8 is true (in every state).
- C9 = X(C8): C8 is true in every state, so in particular C8 is true at s1, thus X(C8) is true at s0.

Therefore C9 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 holds at s0 and blocks event2 forever, so event2 is false in every state. Hence C1 (G event2) is false, making C5 (C1 → X C3) true in every state; thus C6 = G C5 is true, C7 = ¬C6 is false, and C8 = ¬C7 is true in every state. Therefore X(C8) (C9) is true at s0."

True.

Reason: from the context we have an alternating trace starting with event2 (state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, …). Thus event1 eventually happens (C1 true). At any state where event1 holds, C6 = (event1 or C5) is true, so C7 = (C6 and event1) and C8 = (C7 and event1) both hold at that state (e.g. state1).

Summary answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (so event2 is true).
- Additional rule: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" together with the fact event2 already happened initially implies event1 did not (and cannot) happen. So event1 is false.

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" gives the implication event1 ⇒ event2.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means if event2 happens (and it does initially), then no other events (including event1) happen after that — effectively event2 excludes event1 occurring after it. Given event2 already occurred initially, we take event1 = false.
- We therefore have: event2 = True, event1 = False.

3) What each sub-condition means and its truth value
- C1: Event1 does not happen. Since event1 = False, C1 = True.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens. C1 = True and event2 = True, so C2 = True.
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds. event2 = True and C2 = True, so the implication is True; C3 = True.
- C4: Event1 does not happen. Same as C1, so C4 = True.
- C5: If C3 holds, then C4 holds. C3 = True and C4 = True, so the implication is True; C5 = True.
- C6: Event1 happens and C5 holds. Event1 = False, so C6 = False (conjunction with False).
- C7: Event1 does not happen. Same as C1/C4, so C7 = True.
- C8: C6 holds and C7 holds. C6 = False, C7 = True, so C8 = False.
- C9: C8 does not hold (¬C8). Since C8 = False, C9 = True.

4) How the conditions relate to each other
- Many conditions reiterate ""event1 does not happen"" (C1, C4, C7) and are therefore True.
- C2 follows from C1 and the given event2, so it's True.
- C3 and C5 are implications that are satisfied because their antecedents and consequents are True.
- C6 attempts to assert event1 happens, but that contradicts the temporal facts, so C6 is False; that makes C8 False, and C9 (¬C8) True.

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two atomic events: event1 (p) and event2 (q).
- Initial state s0: event2 happened, event1 did not. So s0: q ∧ ¬p.
- Transition rule (from the context): after q, p must happen, and after p, q must happen. Interpreting ""after"" as the next-state operator X gives an alternating trace:
  s0: q ∧ ¬p
  s1: p ∧ ¬q
  s2: q ∧ ¬p
  s3: p ∧ ¬q
  ... (q at even indices, p at odd indices).

2) Transition rules between events
- X q ⇒ p and X p ⇒ q (equivalently, in the next state the other event holds). This yields the infinite alternation q, p, q, p, ...

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (using standard LTL operators: X = next, G = always, F = eventually)
- C1 = ¬p (event1 does not hold in the current state).
- C2 = C1 ∧ q = ¬p ∧ q (current state has q and not p).
- C3 = G C2 (C2 holds at every state).
- C4 = X C3 (in the next state C3 holds).
- C5 = G C4 (C4 holds at every state).
- C6 = ¬C5 (C5 does not hold).
- C7 = X C6 (in the next state C6 holds).
- C8 = X C7 (in the next state C7 holds).
- C9 = F C8 (eventually C8 holds).

4) How the conditions relate and the evaluation
- C2 is true exactly at even states (s0, s2, s4, ...) because those are the states with q ∧ ¬p.
- C3 = G C2 is false (C2 is not true at odd states), so C3 is false at every state.
- C4 = X C3 is false at every state (next state's C3 is false).
- C5 = G C4 is false (C4 is false somewhere), so C5 is false at every state.
- C6 = ¬C5 is therefore true at every state.
- C7 = X C6 is true at every state because C6 is true at every next state.
- C8 = X C7 is true at every state for the same reason.
- C9 = F C8 asks whether C8 holds eventually. Since C8 already holds at the current state (indeed at every state), F C8 is true.

Therefore C9 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C2 (¬p ∧ q) holds only at even states, so C3 = G C2 is false at every state. Hence C4 = X C3 is false everywhere, so C5 = G C4 is false everywhere and C6 = ¬C5 is true everywhere. Therefore C7 = X C6 and C8 = X C7 are true at every state, so F C8 (C9) is true."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs then event1 occurs later).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal; once it happens, nothing else can occur after it).
- Note: No event2 occurrence is given, so Rule A doesn't force anything beyond the initial event1.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the initial condition, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" (same as C3) so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" C4 does hold (true) and event1 does happen (true), so the implication is true. Thus C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Because C5 is true, C6 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and final evaluation of C7?
- C7 is ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" We have C3 = true and C6 = false, so (true OR false) = true.
- Also note: C7 would be true regardless of C6 because C3 alone is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

True

Reason: event1 occurs, so C1 is false → C2 false → C3 true; hence C7 = C3 OR C6 is true."

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (we are in a state reached immediately after event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal (no successors after event1).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal (no successors after event2).
- Because we start after event2 and event2 is terminal, there are no further transitions (no ""next"" state and no future events).

(Assumption: standard temporal semantics where ""next φ"" is false in a state with no successor, and ""eventually φ"" is true only if φ holds now or at some reachable future state.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since the system is in a terminal state after event2 and no further events can happen, event1 cannot occur now or later. C1 = False.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (or, under standard semantics, next-state formulas are false at dead-end states), so C2 = False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is False, C3 = True.
- C4: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1) C4 = False.
- C5: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (same as C2) C5 = False.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" False AND False = False, so C6 = False.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" With no next state (or C6 false), C7 = False.
- C8: ""C3 holds or C7 holds."" True OR False = True, so C8 = True.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1/C4 are identical and both false because event1 can't happen.
- C2/C5 are identical ""next(C1)"" which are false because there is no successor state.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so it becomes true.
- C6 is the conjunction of two false statements, so false; C7 is next(C6) hence false.
- Therefore C8 = C3 OR C7 reduces to True OR False = True.

Conclusion: C8 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Reason: under the context the events alternate (initially event1; after event1 → event2 next; after event2 → event1 next). Take any state where C1 holds (event1 does not happen).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (event1 ⇒ later event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal, no further events (including event1) can ever occur at any future time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value given the context)?
Interpretations (simplified):

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" That is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Truth: False (event1 cannot happen because event2 already occurred and is terminal).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1. Truth: True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 = ¬(¬C1) = C1. Truth: False (same as C1).
- C4: ""C2 does not hold"" (same as C3). Truth: False.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" = ""eventually C4"" = eventually C1. Truth: False (C1 never becomes true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" = next(C5). Truth: False (there is no way for C5 to become true; also if there is no next state, next(...) is false).
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds"" = (C3 ⇒ C6).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is C7?
- We have C3 = C1 = False, and C6 = False.
- The implication C3 ⇒ C6 has a false antecedent (C3 is false). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- Therefore C7 is True.

Short answer: C8 is False (under the usual reading that there is no “next” state after event1). Below is the step-by-step reasoning you asked for and a note about an alternative semantics.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: “After event2, event1 must happen.” (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: “After event1, no other events can happen.” (The state after event1 is terminal: there are no further events/transitions.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (event2 never occurs at any point of the execution)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (globally / at every state: event2 does not happen)
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” (at some future state C2 is true)
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” (in the immediate successor state, C3 is true)
- C5: same as C2
- C6: C4 and C5
- C7: same as C1
- C8: C6 and C7

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event1 has happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any time. So C1 is true.
- If C1 is true (from the start), then C2 (“always C1”) is true.
- If C2 already holds now, then “eventually C2” (C3) is also true (it holds immediately).
- Now consider C4 (“C3 holds in the next state”): here we must use the transition rule B. After event1 there are no further states (no successor). Under the standard temporal semantics where X φ (next φ) is false in a state with no successor, C4 is false because there is no next state in which C3 can hold.
- C5 is true (same as C2). C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is therefore false (because C4 is false).
- C7 is true (same as C1).
- C8 = C6 ∧ C7 is false (because C6 is false).

Conclusion: C8 is False.

Note on alternative semantics: If your model instead treats the terminal state as having a self-loop (i.e., there is a “next” state equal to the same terminal state), then X φ (next) would be evaluated in that self-looped state. In that alternative semantics C4 would be true (C3 holds in that next/self state), making C6 true and hence C8 true. Make sure which “next”/terminal-state semantics your system uses; with the usual reading that there is no successor after event1, C8 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: in the usual semantics a terminal state has no successor, so C4 (X C3) is false, making C6 false and thus C8 false."

Reasoning (concise):
- Let s0 be the initial state (event2 occurred), s1 the next state, s2 the state after that.
- From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we have event1 at s1, so C1 (""event1 in the next state"" from s0) is true.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so at s2 and later no events occur. Thus C1 is false at s1 (it would require event1 at s2), so C2 (next C1) is false at s0. Consequently C3 and all further nested nexts are false at every state, so C4 (""eventually C3"") is false.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is therefore true. C6 is false (same as C3). So C7 = C5 or C6 is true."

- C1/C2 (""event2 in the next state"" i.e. at S1): false (S1 has event1, not event2).
- C3/C6 (""if event2 happens then C2 holds""): at S0 antecedent is true but C2 is false, so C3/C6 are false at S0. At S1 antecedent is false (no event2), so the implication is true at S1.

Answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards (i.e., any state after an event2 must have event1).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can occur (the system has no further events after event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — i.e., in the current state event1 is false.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” — there exists a future state where event1 does not happen.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — it is false that some future state has event1 not happening.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” — C3 is true in the immediate next state.
- C5: same as C4 (duplicate).
- C6: C4 or C5.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At the initial state event1 happened, so C1 is false now.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, the next (and subsequent) states contain no events; in particular, in those future states event1 does not happen. Therefore there does exist a future state where event1 does not happen, so C2 is true.
- Since C2 is true, C3 (which is “C2 does not hold”) is false.
- Consequently C4 and C5 (that C3 holds in the next state) are false.
- C6 = C4 or C5 = false or false = false.

Thus C6 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so the proposition ""event1 happens"" is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur after).
- After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, event2 must occur after).
These rules imply mutual occurrence after either event, but for the truth values below only the initial fact ""event1 happened"" is needed.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
Interpret each Ci as a Boolean proposition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1 — ""event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. ¬C2.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — i.e. ¬C3 (which is equivalent to C2).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" — C1 → C4 (equivalently: event1 → C2).
- C6: ""C2 does not hold"" — same as C3, i.e. ¬C2.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds"" — (C1 → C4) ∧ ¬C2.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — ¬C7.

Step 4 — relation and truth evaluation
Evaluate stepwise using the initial fact event1 is true:
- C1 = event1 = True.
- C2 = event1 = True.
- C3 = ¬C2 = False.
- C4 = ¬C3 = True (also equal to C2).
- C5 = (C1 → C4). Since C1 is True and C4 is True, C5 = True.
- C6 = ¬C2 = False.
- C7 = C5 ∧ C6 = True ∧ False = False.
- C8 = ¬C7 = ¬False = True.

C8 is True.

Answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — whenever event1 occurs, there are no events in subsequent states.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, there are no events in subsequent states.
Both rules make any state that follows a state where event1 or event2 happened a “no-events” state.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: event2 happens in the next state. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 always holds (i.e., in all future states C2 is true).
- C4: C1 and C3 (both must be true).
- C5: C1 and C3 (same as C4).
- C6: C4 or C5.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 happened in the initial state and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the next state cannot have any events — in particular it cannot have event2. Therefore C1 (and C2) is false.
- Since C2 is false in the next state, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.
- C4 and C5 are conjunctions of C1 and C3, so they are false.
- C6 is C4 or C5; false or false is false.

So C6 is False.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Additional facts: after event2, no other events can happen; after event1, no other events can happen.
  Therefore we start in a state where event2 has occurred and no further events (including event1) can occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either happens, no further events can happen.
- Since event2 has already happened initially, no other events (including event1) can ever happen in this run.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
(Interpretation uses ordinary logical implication and temporal notions “always”/“eventually” as written.)

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true.
- C2: same as C1, also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are true tautologies, this implication is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is a plain (time-independent) logical truth, so C4 is true (C3 holds at all times).
- C5: same tautology as C1/C2, true.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" C5 holds, but event1 does not happen (because event2 happened initially and prevents further events). Therefore C6 is false.
- C7: ""C4 holds or C6 holds."" C4 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of C6.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" Because C4 is an invariant truth, C7 is true at all times; hence C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" If something holds always (true at every time), then it certainly holds at some time in the future — so C9 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The chain of implications is dominated by tautologies: C1/C2/C5 are tautologies → C3 is true → C4 is true everywhere.
- Because C4 is true, the disjunction C7 is true, hence C8 is true always. From that, C9 (eventually C8) follows immediately.
- The only false condition is C6 because event1 never happens; but C6 being false does not affect C7/C8/C9 because C4 already makes the disjunction true.

Conclusion: C9 is True.

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 happened.
- Constraints: after event2 (and also after event1) no other events can happen — i.e. once event2 has occurred the system is terminal and no further events occur in any future state.

2) Transition rules
- Since event2 already happened initially and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" the immediate next state after the initial state contains no event occurrences. Likewise, after event1 no further events can occur (same terminal behavior).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition and their truth values
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False — next state has no events because event2 already happened and that makes the system terminal.
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: same as C1. False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True, because C3 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" False, because C2 is false (false ∧ true = false).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False, since C5 is false now and thus does not hold in the next state.
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" True — an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true (C6 is false everywhere).
- C8: ""C7 eventually holds."" True — C7 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some future time (eventually).
- C9: ""C1 holds or C8 holds."" True — C1 is false but C8 is true, so the disjunction is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1/C2/C3 are all the same claim (event2 in the next state) and are false due to the terminal nature after initial event2.
- C4 follows from C3 being false.
- C5 depends on C2 (false) and C4 (true), so C5 is false.
- That makes C6 false as well. C7 is then vacuously true, so C8 (eventually C7) is true.
- Because C8 is true, C9 = C1 ∨ C8 is true.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Detailed step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.
- Additional facts: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once one of them has happened, the system has no further events/transitions.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Because event1 happens initially and event1 is terminal, there are no transitions that can lead to event2 later. In particular, event2 never occurs on any reachable state in this system.
- If one were formalizing in temporal logic: event1 holds in the initial state; after that there is no successor state in which any (new) event holds. (If you treat ""next"" on a dead-end trace as false, then next-state properties evaluate to false.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpretation)
- ""Event2 always happens"" (C1): means globally/eventually in every state event2 holds (or simply: in all states event2 is true). Here we take ""always"" as the usual global operator (G).
- ""C1 always holds"" (C2, C3): ""always"" applied to a proposition means that proposition holds in every state.
- ""C3 always holds"" (C4): same pattern.
- ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"" (C5): a material implication C4 -> event2.
- ""C2 holds and C5 holds"" (C6): conjunction.
- ""C6 holds in the next state"" (C7): the next-state operator X C6.
- ""Event1 happens or C7 holds"" (C8): disjunction event1 ∨ C7.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
Evaluate each in order given the model (event1 true initially, event2 never occurs, terminal).

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False. Event2 never happens (initial state has event1 and that blocks any further events), so C1 does not hold.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False, because C1 is false in the initial state (so it cannot be true in all states).
- C3: same text as C2, so False.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False (C3 is false).
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" True. Material implication with a false antecedent is true; since C4 is false, C5 is true regardless of event2.
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" False ∧ True = False.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" False. C6 is false now and there are no further states where it could become true; so X C6 is false (next-state properties are false on a dead-end).
- C8: ""Event1 happens or C7 holds."" True ∨ False = True. Event1 did happen in the initial state, so the disjunction is true.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.
- Additional facts: “After event1, no other events can happen” and “After event2, no other events can happen.” So once event1 (or event2) has occurred, no further events can occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: after either one occurs, there are no further events. Because event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can happen in the next state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value given the context)?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Given event1 already happened and is terminal, event2 cannot happen next. So C1 = False.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” This requires C1 true; since C1 is False, C2 = False (regardless of whether “event1 happens” is taken as already true).
- C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” This is an implication with antecedent C2. Since C2 is False, the implication is vacuously true. So C3 = True.
- C4: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Same as C1, so C4 = False.
- C5: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” Same as C3, so C5 = True.
- C6: “C4 holds or C5 holds.” C4 is False, C5 is True, so C6 = True.
- C7: “If C3 holds, then C6 holds.” We have C3 = True and C6 = True, so the implication is True.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C2 depends on C1, and C1/C4 are impossible given the initial terminal event1. Because C2 is false, the implications C3 and C5 are vacuously true. That makes C6 true (False or True). With C3 true and C6 true, the implication C7 is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Reasoning (brief):

- Time 0: event2 occurs. By ""after event2 no other events can happen"", at all times >=1 no events occur.
- Evaluate formulas per state:

  - C1 (event2 in next state): false (event2 does not occur at time 1).
  - C2 = (event2 or C1): true at time 0 (event2 true), false at times >=1.
  - C3 same as C2.
  - C4 (C3 in next state): false (C3 is false at time 1).
  - C5 (C4 -> event2): true everywhere (antecedent false).
  - C6 (C2 or C5): true everywhere (C5 true).
  - C7 (C6 and event2): true at time 0, false at times >=1 (because event2 false there).
  - C8 (always C7): false, since C7 does not hold at time 1 (and beyond).

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (given): event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. So since event1 happened, event2 does happen.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen — not needed for the reasoning here.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean (C1–C8)?
- C1: event2 does not happen (¬event2).
- C2: if event1 happens then C1 holds (event1 → ¬event2).
- C3: same as C2 (duplicate).
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold (C2 ∧ C3).
- C5: if C4 holds then event2 happens (C4 → event2).
- C6: event2 does not happen (same as C1, ¬event2).
- C7: C5 and C6 both hold (C5 ∧ C6).
- C8: C7 does not hold (¬C7).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the context, event1 happened and therefore event2 must happen. So event2 does happen.
- Thus C1 (¬event2) and C6 (¬event2) are false.
- Since event1 is true and C1 is false, the conditionals C2 and C3 (event1 → ¬event2) are false (material implication is false when antecedent true and consequent false).
- Therefore C4 (C2 ∧ C3) is false.
- C5 is ""if C4 then event2"". With C4 false, this implication is vacuously true in classical logic, so C5 is true.
- C7 is C5 ∧ C6 = true ∧ false = false.
- C8 is ¬C7, so C8 is true.

Conclusion: C8 is True (given the stated facts and using standard truth conditions for implication).

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened (so the current state is after event2).
- Also given: after event1, no other events can happen; after event2, no other events can happen. So once event1 or event2 has occurred, no further events occur thereafter. In particular, because event2 already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur now or in the future.

2) Transition rules between events?
- The rules say that both event1 and event2 are terminal: when either occurs, the system moves to a state in which no other events happen afterwards. Since event2 already happened initially, there are no transitions that produce new events from now on.

3) What each sub-condition means (informally) and their truth values now:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given no further events can occur (because event2 already happened), event1 cannot happen now or later. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is just ¬C1, so C2 is true (because C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is already true now, it certainly holds eventually. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 and C4 are both true, so the implication is true. (More generally, C5 is true because whenever C3 holds here, C4 also holds.)
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" Since C5 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event1. So C6 is true now.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" We must check the next-state truth of C6.

4) How they relate and evaluation of C7:
- Because event2 already occurred, the future remains a state with no new events. All the truths above that depended on the fact that event1 cannot occur remain true in the next state as well:
  - C1 remains false in the next state (event1 still cannot occur).
  - Hence C2 remains true in the next state, so C3 and C4 (which say C2 holds eventually) remain true there.
  - Therefore C5 remains true in the next state, so C6 (C5 or event1) remains true in the next state (even though event1 does not happen).
- Therefore C6 holds in the next state, so C7 is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 already occurred so event1 can never occur; thus C1 is false, C2 true, C3 and C4 true, C5 true, C6 true, and in the next state those truths persist, so C7 holds."

Reasoning (brief):

- Timeline: t0 initial (event1 happened). By “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 happens at t1. By “after event2, no other events can happen,” there are no further events at t2, t3, ...

- Evaluate at t0:
  - C1 (event2 at next state) is true (event2 occurs at t1). So C2 is true.
  - C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true at t0 because C2 already holds now.
  - C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false: at t1 there will be no further occurrence of event2, so C2 never holds from t1 onward and thus C3 is false at t1.
  - C5 = C1 or C4 is true at t0 (because C1 is true).
  - C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false because at t1 both C1 and C4 are false, so C5 fails at t1.
  - Therefore C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false (C6 never becomes true), and so C8 and C9 are also false.

Thus C9 is False."

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time 0) event2 happened.
- Because “after event2, no other events can happen,” once event2 has occurred the system produces no further events in any later state. So event1 never occurs at any time.

2) Transition rules
- “After event1, event2 must happen” — a constraint that would force event2 after any occurrence of event1, but since event1 never occurs here it never gets applied.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” — event2 is terminal; since it happens initially, no events occur afterwards.

3) Meaning and evaluation of each Ci (given the above)
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. True at the initial state because event2 happened.
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: event1 happens and C2 holds. Requires event1; event1 never happens, so C3 is False.
- C4: C3 always holds (globally). Because C3 is already false, C4 is False.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state. False (C4 is false, so it does not hold next).
- C6: C5 does not hold. True (negation of false).
- C7: If event1 happens, then C6 holds. This implication is true: C6 is true, so the implication holds (even vacuously if event1 does not occur).
- C8: If C7 holds, then event2 happens. C7 does hold, and event2 did happen (initially), so C8 is True.
- C9: C1 holds or C8 holds. C1 is True and C8 is True, so C9 is True.

4) How they relate (summary)
- The initial event2 makes C1/C2 true but prevents event1 ever happening, which makes C3/C4/C5 false and C6 true. That makes C7 true (consequence true), and since C7 is true and event2 did occur, C8 is true. Therefore C9 (C1 or C8) is true.

Conclusion: C9 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Short answer: C8 is True (vacuously), given the stated facts.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens in the initial state.
- Additional rules: after event1, no other events can happen (so there is no future state with any event after the initial state). Also “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (it cannot occur after the initial event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Once event1 has occurred, the system is terminal: there are no further events/states.
- Therefore event2 does not occur anywhere in the trace (it cannot occur after the initial event1).
- In a standard linear-time semantics with a finite trace, ""next"" of the terminal state is false (there is no next state), and ""eventually"" over an empty future is false.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (informally)?
- C1: “event1 does not happen.” (False in the initial state because event1 does happen initially.)
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens.” (False: C1 is false and event2 never happens.)
- C3: “event2 happens or C2 holds.” (Equivalently the same disjunction; false for the same reasons.)
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” (False: there is no next state, so C3 does not hold in the next state.)
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” (False: C4 is false now and there are no future states to make it true.)
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state.” (False for the same reason as C4.)
- C7: “C1 holds or event2 happens.” (Same as C2; false.)
- C8: “If C6 holds, then C7 holds.” This is a logical implication evaluated in the (initial) state.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and final conclusion?
- We have C6 = False and C7 = False.
- An implication ""If C6 then C7"" is true whenever the antecedent (C6) is false (vacuous truth).
- Therefore C8 is True.

Conclusion: C8 is True (vacuously true because C6 is false).

- After event1, event2 must happen — so event1 → event2, and since event1 is true, event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen — event2 is terminal (no additional events follow).

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value?
(Interpret ""If X happens, then Y holds"" as material implication X → Y.)

- C1: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. This is event2 → event2, which is a tautology (always true). So C1 = True.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. This is event2 → C1. Since C1 is True, the implication is True (a true consequent makes the implication true). So C2 = True.
  (Also, since event2 actually happens, you can check: antecedent true and consequent true → implication true.)
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens. C2 is True and event1 is True, so C3 = True.
- C4: If event2 happens, then C3 holds. That is event2 → C3. C3 is True, so C4 = True.
- C5: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. Same as C1, so C5 = True.
- C6: C4 holds or C5 holds. Both C4 and C5 are True, so C6 = True.
- C7: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. This is the same form as C2, so C7 = True.

4) How do these conditions relate and what about C8?
- C8: If C6 holds, then C7 holds — i.e. C6 → C7. We found C6 = True and C7 = True, so the implication C6 → C7 is True.

Therefore C8 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 is true and event1 → event2, so event2 is true. Then
- C1 (event2 → event2) is True.
- C2 (event2 → C1) is True because C1 is True.
- C3 (C2 ∧ event1) is True.
- C4 (event2 → C3) is True because C3 is True.
- C5 (event2 → event2) is True.
- C6 (C4 ∨ C5) is True.
- C7 (event2 → C1) is True.

Thus C8 (C6 → C7) is True."

- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).

Because event1 already happened initially and it forbids any subsequent events, event2 cannot occur at any later time.

Step 3 — meaning and truth of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 happened initially and prevents any further events, so event2 cannot happen.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as: in the scenario described, event2 never happens at any time. That is true (it follows from the initial event1 terminal condition), so C2 is true.

- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" True (both disjuncts are true).

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Extra rules: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So whichever of the two happens, it is terminal — no further events occur. Given the initial fact that event2 happened, event2 is true and event1 does not occur (and cannot occur later).

2) Transition rules between events
- Both events are terminal: occurrence of either prevents any other event after it. Therefore we cannot have a sequence where one happens and then the other happens later. Given the initial occurrence of event2, event1 is not true at any time in the scenario.

3) What each sub-condition means and their truth values under the scenario
Interpret e1 = ""event1 happens"" (False), e2 = ""event2 happens"" (True).

- C1: e1 ∨ e2. With e2 = True, C1 = True.
- C2: e1 ∨ e2. Same as C1, so C2 = True.
- C3: e1 ∨ e2. Same, C3 = True.
- C4: e1 ∧ C3. This requires e1; since e1 = False, C4 = False.
  (Algebraically e1 ∧ (e1 ∨ e2) reduces to e1.)
- C5: e2 ∧ C4. C4 is False, so C5 = False.
- C6: C2 ∧ C5. C5 is False, so C6 = False.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is not true here (and does not hold), C7 is False.
  (If interpreted as a global/temporal ""always"", it is not satisfied.)
- C8: ""If event1 happens, then C7 holds."" This is the implication e1 → C7. Because e1 is False, the implication is vacuously True, so C8 = True.
- C9: C1 ∨ C8. C1 = True (and C8 = True), so C9 = True.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- C1 alone is already true (because event2 happened), so C9 = C1 ∨ C8 is True regardless of C8.
- Even if one inspects the more complex chain (C4 → C5 → C6 → C7), that chain fails because it depends on event1 occurring, which it doesn't after event2.

Therefore C9 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 is true, so C1 (e1 ∨ e2) is true, hence C9 = C1 ∨ C8 is true. (Under standard logic, e1 → C7 is vacuously true since e1 is false, but that isn't needed because C1 already makes C9 true.)"

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened (so the initial state contains event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 happens, the next state has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — there is no successor state after any state that has event2).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (globally — event1 holds now and at every future state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (the next-state operator applied to C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (¬C2).
- C4: ""C2 does not hold"" (same as C3).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" (C3 → C4).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (next C5).
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds"" (event1 ∨ C6).

(Assumption: standard temporal-next semantics: a ""next"" formula is false if there is no successor state.)

4) How they relate / truth values under the context
- Because the initial state already contains event2 and event2 is terminal, event1 never happens. Therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false.
- C2 (C1 in the next state) is false (there is no next state, so next(C1) is false under the standard semantics; even if one attempted to consider a hypothetical next state, C1 is still false because event1 never occurs).
- C3 and C4 are ¬C2, so they are true.
- C5 (C3 → C4) is true (indeed both sides are the same statement, so the implication holds).
- C6 (next C5) is false because there is no successor state after the initial state (so C5 does not “hold in the next state”).
- C7 is (event1) ∨ C6. Both disjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state contains event2 and is terminal, so there is no successor state. Thus any next(·) formula is false. C1 is false (event1 never holds), so C2 = next C1 is false, hence C3 and C4 (¬C2) are true and C5 (C3 → C4) is true. But C6 = next C5 is false (no successor), and event1 is false, so C7 = event1 ∨ C6 is false."

Short answer: C7 is True (vacuously), because C6 never holds under the given behavior.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Interpreting “after … must happen” as an immediate next-state requirement gives a forced alternation:
time 0: event2, time 1: event1, time 2: event2, time 3: event1, … (event2 on even times, event1 on odd times). The same conclusions follow if “after” means “eventually after” rather than strictly next-state: both events recur forever and neither holds continuously from some point onward.

3) What each sub-condition means and its truth value
- C1: “Event1 always happens” (i.e. at every time). False — event1 does not hold at even times.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” (i.e. there is some future time after which event1 holds at every time). False — because events keep alternating, there is no suffix where event1 holds at every time.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” False — C2 is false now and remains false, so it is not true in the next state.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” False — C3 is false, so it cannot always hold.
- C5: “C2 holds in the next state.” (same as C3) False.
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds.” False (both conjuncts false).

4) How they relate and final evaluation of C7
- C6 is false at every time under the given behavior.
- C7: “If C6 holds, then event1 happens.” This is an implication with a false antecedent. Under standard (material) implication, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Therefore C7 is True.

(If you intended a different semantics for the implication — e.g. a temporal implication with different timing requirements — say how you mean it and I can re-evaluate, but under the usual reading C7 is true because C6 never holds.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C6 (C4 and C5) never holds under the alternating-event behavior, so the implication ""If C6 then event1"" is vacuously true under standard material implication."

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, neither event2 nor any other event can occur later.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This is irrelevant here because event2 never happens given the initial condition.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened and no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to happen; since it does not, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is False but event1 does happen, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 is True and event1 is True, so the implication is True.
- C5: Same as C4, so also True.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are True, so C6 is True.

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning (with standard temporal semantics: ""initially"" = at time 0, ""after"" = next-state, F = eventually (now or later), X = next, G = always):

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (time 0): event1 holds.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ whenever event1 holds at time t, event2 holds at time t+1.
- After event2, event1 must happen ⇒ whenever event2 holds at time t, event1 holds at time t+1.
- Starting from event1 at t=0, these rules force an alternating sequence:
  t=0: event1, t=1: event2, t=2: event1, t=3: event2, … (event1 on even times, event2 on odd times).

3) Meaning of each Ci (and truth value)
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds immediately (everywhere), C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). C2 is true in every state, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" (¬C3). Because C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" (¬C4). Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). C5 is true everywhere, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds"" (event2 ∨ C6). C6 is true, so C7 is true in every state (regardless of event2).
- C8: ""C7 always holds"" (G C7). Because C7 is true in every state, C8 is true.
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" (X C8). C8 holds in every state, so C9 is true.

4) How they relate
- The chain of implications reduces to alternating-event constraints plus several tautologies/negations. C1 being a tautology makes C2 true, which makes C3 true, which makes C4 false, which flips to make C5 true, which makes C6 true, etc. Once you hit a universally true condition (C6), the disjunction C7 becomes always true, so C8 and then C9 follow as true.

Conclusion: Under the usual interpretations above, C9 evaluates to True.

Summary answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Transition rules given: After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
  From ""after event1 no other events can happen"" and the fact event1 happened initially, it follows that event2 never happens (in the initial state or any future state).

2) Transition / temporal consequences
- Because event1 has already happened and it forbids any subsequent events, event2 is impossible in every state (now and in all future states).

3) Meaning of each C_i (interpretation in temporal logic)
- C1: Event2 does not happen (we take this as ""event2 does not hold in the current state""; under the context, it holds now and in all future states).
- C2: Event2 does not happen (same as C1).
- C3: If C1 holds then C2 holds. Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C3 is true (indeed a tautological implication here).
- C4: C3 holds or event1 happens. Given C3 is true, C4 is true (in every state).
- C5: C4 always holds (□C4). Because C4 is true in every state, C5 is true.
- C6: C5 holds in the next state (X C5). Since C5 is true in every state, X C5 is true.
- C7: C6 does not hold (¬X C5). But X C5 is true, so C7 is false.
- C8: C7 always holds (□C7). Because C7 is false (at least now), □C7 is false, so C8 is false.
- C9: C8 does not hold (¬□C7). Since C8 is false, ¬C8 is true, so C9 is true.

4) How the conditions relate (compact chain)
- From initial event1 → event2 impossible → C1 and C2 true.
- C1 → C2 makes C3 true → C4 true → C5 true (always).
- C5 true in every state → C6 true → C7 false → C8 false → C9 true.

Therefore C9 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 occurs initially and forbids any later events, so event2 never occurs. Hence C1 and C2 are true everywhere, making C3 true, so C4 is true, so □C4 (C5) is true, so X C5 (C6) is true, so ¬X C5 (C7) is false, so □C7 (C8) is false, and ¬C8 (C9) is true."

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen (i.e. event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (informally)?
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: Event1 eventually happens. (same as C1)
- C3: (Event1 happens) OR (C2 holds). Since C2 is “event1 eventually happens,” C3 is true whenever event1 will eventually happen.
- C4: C3 does not hold (negation of C3).
- C5: C4 always holds (globally C4 is true).
- C6: If C5 holds then event2 happens (C5 ⇒ event2).
- C7: Event1 eventually happens. (same as C1)
- C8: C6 holds OR C7 holds.
- C9: C1 holds OR C8 holds.

4) How these conditions relate and their truth values under the given rules
- From the initial condition and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 eventually happens. So C1, C2, and C7 are true.
- Because C2 is true, C3 (“event1 happens or C2”) is true.
- Therefore C4 (“C3 does not hold”) is false.
- C5 (“C4 always holds”) is false (C4 is not even true).
- C6 (“if C5 then event2”) is true vacuously, because its antecedent C5 is false (in classical logic an implication with false antecedent is true).
- C8 = (C6 or C7) is true because C7 is true (and also C6 is true vacuously).
- C9 = (C1 or C8) is true because C1 is true (and C8 is also true).

Conclusion: C9 is True.

Short answer: C7 is False (assuming the usual semantics where ""next"" is false at a terminal state).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state.
- Additional facts: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has occurred no further events (no further states with events) follow.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event1 already occurred initially and it is terminal, there are no further transitions after the initial state. In particular, event2 cannot occur at any later time in this run.
- Also, if event2 ever occurred, it would likewise be terminal (but in our run it does not occur).

3) What each Ci means and its truth value
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False — event2 cannot happen after the initial event1, which already happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" True — event1 did happen, so the disjunction is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is false in the run: C2 is true but event2 does not happen, so the implication fails.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" This implication is vacuously true in the run because event2 does not happen (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the same as C3, so false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" True, because C4 is true (even though C5 is false).

4) How these conditions relate and final question about C7
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (the initial state is terminal because event1 happened and prevents further events). Under the standard semantics where X p (""next p"") is false at a terminal/last state, ""C6 in the next state"" is false. Therefore C7 is False.

Note on assumptions: This conclusion assumes the usual temporal logic convention that ""next"" is false at a final/terminal state (or that there simply is no next state, so the property ""holds in the next state"" does not hold). If you adopt a different semantics for Next (e.g., you treat the last state as having a reflexive successor), the answer could differ — mention that if you want, and I can re-evaluate under alternative semantics.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 already occurred and is terminal, so there is no next state; under the usual semantics where ""next"" is false at a terminal state, C6 cannot hold in the next state, so C7 is false. (If you instead assume a reflexive successor at terminal states, C7 would be true.)"

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (it is true in the initial state).
- Additional constraint: once event2 has happened, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).
- Also: “after event1, event2 must happen” — an obligation that if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur afterwards.

Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after it, event1 cannot occur at any time in any run.

2) Transition rules between events
- From any state that has event2, there are no outgoing transitions (no further events).
- From a state with event1, the system must (eventually) have event2 afterwards. But since event2 already occurred initially and nothing can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur in any reachable state. So there are no reachable states in which the “after event1” rule needs to be applied.

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” This is a tautology (A → A). It is true in all states; in particular it holds in the initial state.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” Since C1 is true, this reduces to “event2 happens.” That is true in the initial state (event2 already happened), so C2 holds.
- C3, C4: same as C2 (same antecedent/consequent), so they also hold.
- C5: “C3 holds or C4 holds.” True because both C3 and C4 hold.
- C6: “C2 holds or C5 holds.” True because C2 holds (and C5 does too).
- C7: “C6 always holds.” Interpreting “always” as holding in every reachable state (the usual temporal reading), we check reachable states: the initial state (with event2) is the only reachable state because event2 is terminal. C6 is true in that state, and there are no other states where it could be falsified. Therefore C7 is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 is trivially true; from that C2, C3, C4 follow (they assert event2 given C1).
- C3 or C4 gives C5; C2 or C5 gives C6.
- Since event2 is true in the only reachable state, all of C2–C6 are true there.
- Because no further states are reachable (event2 is terminal), C6 holds in every reachable state, so C7 (“C6 always holds”) is true.

Conclusion: Under the given assumptions (event2 true initially and terminal), C7 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start (so the only actual event that occurs in the system is event1 at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
- Because event1 already happened initially, no further events can occur and event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
(I read “always” as the usual temporal/ global operator meaning “at all times” or “in every state/time-point” rather than “in every possible run” — see the alternative interpretation note at the end.)

- C1: “Event1 always happens.” This requires that at every time point/state event1 holds. In our run event1 holds at time 0 but not at later time points (there are later points with no event1 happening), so C1 is false.
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” Event1 happens (true initially) but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” Same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” Same as C2/C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: “C3 holds and C4 holds.” Both C3 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: “C2 holds or C5 holds.” Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 always holds.” Since C6 is already false at the initial point, “always C6” is false. So C7 is false.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate
- All Ci from C2 onward depend on C1 being true. Because C1 is not true under the usual temporal reading, every dependent condition is false, and thus C7 is false.

Alternative interpretation note
- If “always” were intended to mean “in every possible execution/run of the system (i.e., in every branch of the model) event1 occurs at least once” or simply “event1 occurs in every run” — then because event1 happens initially in the unique actual run, C1 would be true, and that would make C2–C7 true. But under the standard temporal reading “always = at every time point/state,” C7 is false (as shown above).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Interpreting ""always"" as ""at every time point,"" C1 is false (event1 holds only initially, not at all times). Therefore C2–C6 are false and ""always C6"" (C7) is also false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no further events can happen.
- After event2 happens, no further events can happen.
Together these mean both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has occurred, the system has no subsequent events. Since event1 already happened initially, there are no reachable states with any additional events after the initial state.

3) What each sub-condition means (natural reading):
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a next-state claim)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (globally: in every state C1 holds)
- C3: same as C2 (duplicate)
- C4: same as C2 (duplicate)
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" (implication)
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" (conjunction)
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" (there exists some reachable state where C6 is true)

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule says no events occur after event1, there is no next state in which an event happens. So C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, the universal claims C2, C3, C4 (""C1 always holds"") are all false.
- C5 (""if C3 then C4"") is true: an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- C6 is C2 ∧ C5. C2 is false and C5 is true, so C6 is false.
- C7 asks whether C6 holds at some reachable point (eventually). C6 is false now and there are no reachable states where events occur to change that, so C6 never becomes true. Therefore C7 is false.

Possible note on ambiguity: if one used a different formal semantics for ""next"" or ""always"" (e.g., counting the initial state as ""next""), the truth assignments could shift. Under the common interpretation above, C7 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After a state in which event1 happened, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After a state in which event2 happened, no further events can happen in later states (the trace becomes eventless/terminal).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (reading temporal operators in the usual linear-time way: X = “next”, G = “always/globally”):
- C1: X(event2) — event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: G(C1) — C1 holds in every state (C1 always holds).
- C3: same as C1: X(event2).
- C4: same as C2: G(C1).
- C5: (C3 → C4) — if X(event2) holds now, then X(event2) holds in every state.
- C6: G(C5) — C5 holds in every state.
- C7: G(C6) — C6 holds in every state.
- C8: C2 ∨ C7 — either C2 holds or C7 holds.

4) How they relate / truth values on the actual trace
Label the states as s0 (initial, event1 happened), s1 (next state, event2 happens), and s2 (after s1, no events).

- At s0: C1 (X(event2)) is true because s1 has event2.
- At s1: C1 is false because the next state s2 has no events (event2 does not happen again).
- Therefore C2 = G(C1) is false (C1 is not true in every state).
- C3 is true at s0 (same as C1 there); C4 is false (same as C2).
- C5 = (C3 → C4) is false at s0 because the antecedent is true at s0 while the consequent is false.
- Since C5 is already false at s0, C6 = G(C5) is false, and hence C7 = G(C6) is false.
- Finally C8 = C2 ∨ C7 is false ∨ false = False.

Conclusion: C8 is False.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the initial moment (so event1 is true now).
- Also given: after event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal for the future).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: Once event1 has happened, no further events can occur afterwards. So after the initial event1, there can be no event2 later.
- Rule B: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen (i.e., event2 implies that event1 occurs at some point). Because event1 already happened initially, this constraint doesn’t force any new occurrences, but it does not allow event2 to imply a future event1 if event1 prevented further events. In any case, given event1 is already true and terminal, event2 cannot occur after it and there is no earlier time for event2 in the given initial model, so event2 never happens.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True. C1 is true unconditionally, and moreover event1 did happen so the implication is satisfied.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" True (event1 is true, and C2 is also true).
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Same as C3, True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True, because C4 holds now (so it holds at some time, satisfying ""eventually"").
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" True (both are true).
- C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" Since event2 does not happen (cannot happen after the initial event1), but C6 holds, the disjunction is true. So C7 is True.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary):
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after it, event1 is true and event2 is impossible.
- That makes C1 true, which in turn makes the implication C2 true, which makes C3/C4 true, hence C5 true, hence C6 true.
- Therefore C7 (event2 or C6) is true because of C6.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.
- Extra constraints: “After event1, no other events can happen” and “After event2, no other events can happen.” In particular, since event1 already happened initially, no other event (including event2) can occur after that.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Both rules are blocking: if event1 has happened, no further events occur; similarly if event2 happens, no further events occur. Given the initial state (event1 happened), event2 does not occur afterward.

3) What each sub-condition means (interpreting “always” and “eventually” in the usual temporal sense):
- C1: (event2 → event2). This is a logical tautology (an implication p→p is always true) regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Since C1 is a tautology at every state, C2 is true.
- C3: “Event1 happens or C2 holds.” Event1 already happened, and C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” Because C2 is always true, the disjunction in C3 is true at all times, so C4 is true.
- C5: “C1 always holds.” Same as C2, so C5 is true.
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds.” Both are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: “C6 always holds.” Since C6 is true (and its components are always true), C7 is true.
- C8: “C7 eventually holds.” If C7 is true now and in all states (always), then it certainly holds at some future time — hence “eventually” is satisfied. So C8 is true.

4) How they relate / final evaluation:
- Many conditions are redundant because C1 is a tautology, which makes C2 and C5 true always; that propagates through the chain so every Ci from C1 up to C7 is true (in fact always true), and therefore C8 (“eventually C7”) is true.

- Hence C8 (""C7 eventually holds"") is true now because C7 already holds.
- In the next state no events occur (given ""after event1, no other events can happen""), so event2 does not happen there; an implication of the form ""if event2 then C6"" is therefore true in that next state (antecedent false).

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (interpreted as: in the next state after a state where event2 occurs, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (in the next state after a state where event1 occurs, event2 occurs).
- So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence of events starting from state 0: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, … .

(Assumption: time is discrete and “after” means the next state. The conclusion below is robust under the standard meanings of “eventually” (there exists some future state, usually allowing the current state as well).)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. Given the alternating sequence, C1 holds at every state (each state has either event1 or event2).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state. Because every state’s next state also has event1 or event2, C2 holds at every state.
- C3: C2 eventually holds. Since C2 holds now (indeed at every state), C3 is true (there exists a future state — in fact the current one — where C2 holds).
- C4: same as C3 (C2 eventually holds).
- C5: event1 happens and C4 holds. This is true exactly at those states where event1 holds (odd states), because C4 is globally true. So C5 holds at every state where event1 occurs.
- C6: C5 holds and event1 happens. This is the same as C5 (redundant repetition of event1), so C6 and C5 are equivalent: they hold exactly at event1 states.
- C7: C3 holds or C6 holds. This is the disjunction of “C2 eventually holds” (C3) and “(event1 and C4)” (C6).

4) How do these conditions relate and final evaluation?
- Logical simplifications:
  - C3 and C4 are identical.
  - C5 and C6 are identical.
  - C7 = C3 OR C6 = (C2 eventually holds) OR (event1 AND C2 eventually holds) = C2 eventually holds (because X OR (Y AND X) = X).
- Since C2 holds at every state, ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is true. Therefore C7 is true.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

(These rules imply event1 does happen, and event2 follows it.)

3) What each C means and its truth value under the context
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False (because event1 did happen).
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False (same as C1).
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False (same again).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — True (negation of false).
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" — True (implication is true when antecedent C2 is false).
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" — True (C1 is false but C5 is true, so the disjunction is true).
- C7: ""C3 does not hold."" — True (same as C4).
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" — True (both C6 and C7 are true, so the disjunction is true).

4) How they relate / conclusion
- Because the context makes C1–C3 false and thus C4 and C7 true, C5 is true (vacuously), so C6 is true. Therefore C8 (C6 or C7) is true.

So C8 is True.

Reason: Let time 0 be the initial state. Event1 occurs at time 0 and, by the context, no events occur at any time > 0. 
- C4..C6 are next-chained: C6 at time 0 requires C3 to hold at time 3.
- At time 3 event2 does not occur, so the implication C3 (""if event2 then C2"") is vacuously true there. Hence C6 holds at time 0.
- Event1 holds at time 0, so C7 (C6 and event1) holds at time 0.
- Therefore C8 (eventually C7) holds, and consequently C9 (eventually C8) holds.

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 has happened (event2 is true at time 0).

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (whenever event1 occurs, the next state includes event2).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred the system cannot produce any new events thereafter). Since event2 already holds initially, that effectively blocks any future occurrence of event1.

3) What each sub-condition means (informal temporal reading):
- C1: “event1 eventually happens” (event1 occurs at some future state).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C2 holds AND event2 holds (both “event1 eventually happens” and event2 hold now).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state.
- C5: C4 always holds (in every state).
- C6: C5 holds in the next state.
- C7: C1 holds AND C6 holds.
- C8: C7 holds AND event2 holds.
- C9: C8 does not hold.

4) How they relate and final truth values
- Because event2 already holds initially and “after event2 no other events can happen,” event1 cannot occur at any future time. Therefore C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 = (C2 ∧ event2) is false (C2 false, event2 true).
- C4 (C3 in next state) is false for the same reason (C2 never becomes true).
- C5 (always C4) is false.
- C6 (C5 in next state) is false.
- C7 (C1 ∧ C6) is false.
- C8 (C7 ∧ event2) is false.
- C9 is “C8 does not hold.” Since C8 is false, C8 does not hold is true.

Therefore C9 is True.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.
- Additional rules: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means each event is terminal: once that event occurs at some time point, no events occur at any strictly later time points.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- There is no rule allowing any event after a terminal event. Because event2 happened initially, there will be no events in any state after the initial one. In particular, in the next state (the state immediately after the initial one) neither event1 nor event2 occurs.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting “always” as globally true)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" — asserts event1 holds in every state (a global claim).
- C2: same as C1 (redundant).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" — logically: C2 → event1 (this can be true vacuously if C2 is false).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" — C3 holds in all states.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" — conjunct true only where event2 holds and C4 holds.
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds.""
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds.""
- C8: ""C7 holds or event2 happens.""
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state."" — the claim we must evaluate in the state immediately after the initial state.

4) How these conditions relate and truth evaluation (initial state and next state)
- Because initially event2 happened, event2 is true in the initial state; but by the terminal rule, in the next state no events occur, so event2 is false in the next state and event1 is also false there.
- Evaluate important propositions:

Initial state:
- event2: true.
- C1, C2 (""event1 always happens""): false (they would require event1 to hold everywhere, which conflicts with ""no events after event2"").
- C3 (C2 → event1): true (vacuously true because C2 is false).
- C4 (C3 always holds): true (C3 is true in every state).
- C5 (event2 ∧ C4): true (event2 true here and C4 true).
- C6 (event2 ∨ C5): true.
- C7 (C1 ∧ C6): false (C1 false).
- C8 (C7 ∨ event2): true (because event2 is true).

Next state (immediately after the initial state):
- event2: false (no events occur after the initial event2).
- event1: false.
- C1, C2: still false (they assert event1 everywhere, which fails here).
- C3: still true (C2 false ⇒ implication true).
- C4: still true (C3 holds in every state).
- C5 (event2 ∧ C4): false (event2 false).
- C6 (event2 ∨ C5): false.
- C7 (C1 ∧ C6): false.
- C8 (C7 ∨ event2): false.

Therefore C9 (“C8 holds in the next state”) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 occurs in the initial state and both events are terminal, so in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds. Thus in the next state C7 (which requires C1 and C6) is false and event2 is false, so C8 = C7 ∨ event2 is false there. Therefore C9 (""C8 holds in the next state"") is false."

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state (so at least in the initial state event1 is true). Also, because of the rule “after event1, no other events can happen,” once event1 has happened the system reaches a state with no further events.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: no other events can happen (so no transitions producing event2 after event1).
- After event2: event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards / eventually).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” (stated twice as C2 as well)
- C3: C1 or C2 (redundant since C1 and C2 are the same)
- C4: “Event1 always happens.” (same claim again)
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” (saying the claim C4 will hold at some point)
- C6: C3 or C5 (either C3 holds or C5 holds)
- C7: C6 holds in the next state
- C8: Event1 happens or C7 holds (disjunction)
- C9: If event1 happens, then C8 holds (implication)

(Interpretation note: “Event1 happens” and the other Cs can be read as propositions at the current state; the following reasoning does not depend on subtle temporal variations.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C9 true or false?
- C8 is the formula (event1) ∨ C7.
- C9 is the implication (event1) → ((event1) ∨ C7).

This is a basic logical tautology: p → (p ∨ q) is always true for any propositions p and q. Reason:
- If p is true, then p ∨ q is true, so the implication is true.
- If p is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C9 is True. This does not require any of the other contextual rules — it is true purely by propositional logic.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.
- Additional rules: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. (So both event1 and event2 are terminal — once one has happened, no further events occur afterward.)

2) Transition rules between events
- From the initial state (where event1 happened), no further events can occur because of the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen.""
- There is therefore no future state in which a new event (event1 or event2) can occur after the initial occurrence of event1.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true at every state/time.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (negation of C2)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (negation of C3)
- C5: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (same as C1)
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds.""
- C7: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (same as C1/C5)
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds.""
- C9: ""C8 eventually holds."" (there exists some future state where C8 is true)

4) How they relate and truth values (given the initial conditions and transition rules)
- Because event1 occurs initially and no events can occur afterward, ""Event1 happens in the next state"" is false. So C1 = False.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore False.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is True (negation of a false statement).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is False (negation of a true statement).
- C5 = same as C1 = False.
- C6 = (C4 and C5) = False (because C4 is false).
- C7 = same as C1 = False.
- C8 = (C6 or C7) = False.
- C9 = ""C8 eventually holds."" Since C8 is already false in the initial state and no future events can change any of these (there is no way for C6 or C7 to become true in the future), C8 will never become true. Therefore C9 is False.

Conclusion: C9 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: After the initial event1, no further events can occur, so ""event1 in the next state"" (C1/C5/C7) is false. That makes C2 false, C3 true, C4 false, so C6 (C4 and C5) is false and C7 is false. Hence C8 (C6 or C7) is always false and therefore C9 (""C8 eventually holds"") is false."

Short answer: C8 is True (when evaluated in the initial state).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (call this state 0): event2 happens in state 0.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
  So from state 0 (event2) → state 1 has event1.
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
  So from state 1 (event1) → state 2 has event2.
- Therefore the sequence from the initial state is: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, … (they alternate).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean? (interpreted at the initial state, i.e. evaluated at state0)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Means: event2 holds in state1.
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” A conditional about the current state: (event1_now → C1_now).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Means: C2 is true when evaluated at state1.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” Negation of C3 evaluated at state0.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” Negation of C4 (double negation) at state0.
- C6: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” (same form as C2; a repetition) evaluated at state0.
- C7: “C5 holds or C6 holds.” Disjunction evaluated at state0.
- C8: “Event2 happens and C7 holds.” Conjunction evaluated at state0.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values (evaluated at the initial state, state0)?

Evaluate using the alternating-event sequence:

- C1 at state0: is event2 true in state1? No — state1 has event1. So C1 is False.
- C2 at state0: (event1_now → C1). In state0 event1 does not happen (event2 happens), so the implication is vacuously true. So C2 is True at state0.
- C2 at state1 (needed for C3): In state1 event1 happens, and C1 evaluated at state1 asks whether event2 happens in state2 — that is true (by the rules). So at state1, the implication (event1 → C1) is true. Thus C2 holds in state1.
- C3 at state0: “C2 holds in the next state (state1)” — true, because we just found C2 true at state1. So C3 is True.
- C4 at state0: “C3 does not hold” — false, because C3 holds.
- C5 at state0: “C4 does not hold” — true, because C4 is false.
- C6 at state0: same form as C2, and since event1 does not occur in state0 the implication is vacuously true. So C6 is True.
- C7 at state0: “C5 or C6” — both are True, so C7 is True.
- C8 at state0: “event2 happens and C7 holds” — event2 does happen in state0 (initial condition) and C7 is True, so C8 is True.

Conclusion: C8 is True (given the described initial condition and transition rules, evaluated in the initial state).

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (call that state s0: event1 = true, event2 = false).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
So the (canonical) run consistent with the rules is an infinite alternation:
s0: event1 true, event2 false
s1: event2 true, event1 false
s2: event1 true, event2 false
s3: event2 true, …
and so on.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (plain reading) and how they evaluate on the above run?
I read the Ci’s as plain propositions about the run:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., at every state event2 is true)
  - Evaluation: False. At s0 event2 is false.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""
  - Evaluation: False, because C1 is false (a conjunction with a false conjunct is false).

- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""
  - Evaluation: False. At s1 (and other odd states) event2 happens (antecedent true) but C2 is false (consequent false), so the implication is false.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
  - Evaluation: False at s0, because in the next state s1, C3 is false. (Thus C4 does not hold at s0; in fact C3 is false everywhere where event2 occurs.)

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
  - Evaluation: False. C4 never becomes true, so it is not true eventually.

- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""
  - This is the same as C3; evaluation: False.

- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds.""
  - Evaluation: False ∧ False = False.

4) How the conditions relate and the final conclusion
- Because C1 is false (event2 is not true at the initial state), many later conditions that depend on C1 fail.
- C3/C6 fail because there are states where event2 holds but C2 (which requires C1) does not.
- Consequently C4, C5 and then C7 fail.

So C7 is False under the straightforward reading above.

(If you intended different temporal meanings for words like ""always"" or for when ""happens"" is evaluated, tell me the intended formal semantics and I can re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Brief justification: In the run s0 (event1), s1 (event2), s2 (event1), ... event2 is not always true, so C1 is false. Hence C2 is false, so the implication C3 (and C6) is false at states where event2 holds. Therefore C4 and C5 never become true, and C7 = C5 ∧ C6 is false."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Reasoning step by step (using a simple two-state timeline: s0 = initial, s1 = the next state):

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in s0.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 (s0) event2 must happen (so s1 is a state where event2 happens).
- After event2 (s1) no other events can happen (s1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (interpreting ""always"" as “holds in every current and future state” and “next” as the immediate successor state)
- C1: “Event2 always happens” (G event2). At s0 this is false because event2 does not hold in s0 (it only holds in s1).
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” C1 is false, so C2 is false (even though event1 is true in s0).
- C3: “C2 always holds” (G C2). Since C2 is false at s0, C3 is false.
- C4: same as C3 — false.
- C5: “C4 holds or event2 happens.” At s0 this is false (C4 false and event2 not yet true), but at s1 it is true because event2 holds there.
- C6: “If C3 holds, then C5 holds.” This implication is vacuously true wherever C3 is false. Since C3 is false at s0 (and also not holding in s1), C6 is true in both s0 and s1.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” Evaluate C7 at s0: the next state is s1, and we just saw C6 is true in s1. Hence C7 is true at s0.

4) Relation and final conclusion
- Because C3 is false, the implication C6 is true (vacuously), and C6 remains true in the next state s1. Therefore C7 (“C6 holds in the next state”) is True under the stated semantics and the given context.

(If you had a different formal interpretation of “always” or “happens” please tell me and I can re-evaluate under that semantics.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Brief justification: s0: event1 holds, s1: event2 holds and is terminal. C2 is false in both states (C1 = ""G event2"" fails at s0 because event2 is not yet true), so C3 (""G C2"") is false everywhere. Hence C6 (C3 → C5) is vacuously true in every state, so C6 holds in the next state s1. Therefore C7 is True."

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward.
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Because event1 already happened initially and forbids any later events, event2 cannot occur at any time in this run.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value)?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true now (and at all times), C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1 — true.
- C4: same as C2 — true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" True (both conjuncts true).
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" True (both disjuncts true).
- C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens."" Both C6 and event1 are true (event1 happened initially), so C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 does hold, C8 is false.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- The tautological C1 makes C2 true, and similarly C3/C4/C5/C6 are all true. With event1 true as well, C7 is true, so its negation C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Below are the steps and reasoning (I state one natural interpretation and note an alternative at the end).

Assumptions I use:
- “EventX happens” means “EventX occurs at some point in the timeline” (i.e. it is an eventuality, not necessarily simultaneous with other facts).
- “always” means “holds at every time” (a statement that is true about the whole timeline).

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (at the start). By the transition rules below, both events will occur at least once (indeed repeatedly).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur.
So from the initial event1 we get event2 later, then event1 again, etc. Thus both event1 and event2 do happen (and in fact occur repeatedly).

3) What each Ci means and evaluation
- C1: “Event1 happens and event1 happens.” This is just “event1 happens.” True (given the initial event1).
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” Since C1 is true and event2 will happen (by the rule), C2 is true.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” C2 is a global fact (“event1 happens and event2 happens”), so it is true at every time → C3 is true.
- C4: “If C3 holds, then event1 happens.” C3 is true and event1 does happen, so the implication is true → C4 is true.
- C5: same as C1 → true.
- C6: “C4 holds or C5 holds.” At least one is true (both are), so C6 is true.
- C7: “C6 does not hold.” Since C6 holds, C7 is false.
- C8: “C7 always holds.” C7 is false, so C8 is false.
- C9: “C8 always holds.” C8 is false, so C9 is false.

4) How the conditions relate
- From the event rules we get event1 and event2 happen; that makes C1 and C2 true.
- Making C2 a global fact makes C3 true and therefore C4 true; C5 is true independently, so C6 is true.
- C7 negates C6 so is false, and anything “always” of a false proposition stays false, so C8 and C9 are false.

Alternative interpretation note:
- If instead “happens” were interpreted as “happens right now/at the same instant” (so conjunctions demand simultaneity), the truth of C2 could be different (likely false), and that would change the chain. Under the natural interpretation used above (events occur over time, and “happens” means “occurs sometime”), C9 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.
- Additional constraint: after event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Because event1 occurs initially and is terminal, no occurrences of event2 can happen at any later time.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event2 ever happens, then event1 must happen afterwards (whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event1).
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen after it (so nothing can occur later).

Combining these with the initial event1: since event1 has already happened and forbids any further events, event2 never occurs.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition and its truth value
Assuming the natural readings “always happens” = “is true at all times” and “eventually holds” = “becomes true at some future time”:

- C1: “Event2 always happens.” — False (event2 never occurs).
- C2: “Event2 always happens.” — Same as C1 — False.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” i.e. “at some time C2 becomes true” — False (C2 never becomes true).
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” — True (because C3 is false).
- C5: “C1 holds and C4 holds.” — False (C1 is false, so the conjunction is false).
- C6: “C5 does not hold.” — True (because C5 is false).
- C7: “C2 eventually holds.” — Same as C3 — False.
- C8: “C6 holds and C7 holds.” — requires C6 true and C7 true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- We have C6 = True and C7 = False, so the conjunction C8 is False.

Therefore C8 is False. (If you intended different formal semantics for “always” or “eventually,” tell me and I can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happened.
- Additional constraints: once event1 has happened, no further events can happen; likewise, once event2 has happened, no further events can happen.

2) Transition rules / consequences
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", no later state can have event2 (or any other event) occur.
- In particular, event2 never happens in any future state of this run.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: (event2 → event1) — if event2 happens (in the current state), then event1 happens (in that state). Since event2 is false in the initial state, this implication is vacuously true there.
- C2: C1 holds AND event1 happens (in the current state). Given C1 is true and event1 did happen initially, C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — that is, in the immediate successor state, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — at some future state C3 is true.
- C5: same as C3 (C2 holds in the next state).
- C6: C4 AND C5.
- C7: NOT C6 (C6 does not hold).

4) How these relate and evaluation
- C1: true (vacuously).
- C2: true (C1 true and event1 happened initially).
- C3/C5: false. C2 requires ""event1 happens"" in that state; event1 happened only in the initial state and, because no further events can occur after event1, event1 will not happen in the next state. So C2 does not hold in the next state.
- C4: false. Since C3 is false now and there is no way for event1 to reoccur later, C3 never becomes true, so ""eventually C3"" is false.
- C6 = C4 AND C5: false AND false = false.
- C7 = NOT C6: true.

Therefore C7 is True.

(If you intended a different semantics—for example treating ""event1 has happened"" as a persistent state property that remains true in all future states—the truth values can change; tell me if you want the analysis under that alternative interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 occurs only in the initial state and prevents any later events, so C2 is true initially but C2 does not hold in the next state (C3/C5 false), hence C4 false and C6 false, so C7 = not C6 is true. (If instead ""event1 happened"" were a persistent state property, the answer would flip.)"

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (state s0) event1 happens (so event1 true at s0, event2 false at s0).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpreted as: whenever event1 holds at a state, event2 holds at the next state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 holds, event1 holds at the next state.
- With those immediate-next rules and the initial event1 at s0, the system produces an infinite alternating trace:
  s0: event1
  s1: event2
  s2: event1
  s3: event2
  ... and so on.

3) What each Ci means (reading temporal operators: always = G, next = X, eventually = F)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" = event1 (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: same as C1 = event1.
- C3: C1 ∧ C2 = event1 (still just event1).
- C4: C3 always holds = G(event1) (event1 holds at every future state).
- C5: C4 holds in the next state = X G(event1).
- C6: C5 holds in the next state = X X G(event1).
- C7: C6 always holds = G(X X G(event1)).
- C8: C7 eventually holds = F(G(X X G(event1))).
- C9: C8 always holds = G(F(G(X X G(event1)))).

4) How they relate and truth values on the alternating trace
- C3 is true exactly at states where event1 holds: s0, s2, s4, ...
- C4 = G(event1) is false at s0 (and at every state) because event1 does not hold at s1 (so it is not true at all future states). Thus C4 is false everywhere.
- If C4 is false everywhere then X C4 (C5) is false everywhere, X X C4 (C6) false everywhere, G(C6) (C7) false everywhere, F(C7) (C8) false (there is no future state where C7 is true), and finally G(C8) (C9) is false.
- Therefore C9 is false on the given model/trace.

(If ""after"" were intended to mean ""eventually later"" rather than ""in the next state"", the same alternating model still follows from the two mutual obligations and initial event1, and the conclusion that G(event1) is false still holds — so C9 would remain false.)

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.
- I assume “next state” means the state immediately after the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning and truth of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
  Given the rule, the next state must have event1 (not event2). So C1 is False.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""  
  event1 does happen in the next state, so C2 is True.

- C3: same as C2, so C3 is True.

- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds.""  
  At least one of C2 or C3 is True (in fact both), so C4 is True.

- C5: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
  Same as C1, so C5 is False.

- C6: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
  Same as C1, so C6 is False.

- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" (C5 → C6)  
  An implication with a false antecedent is True in classical logic, so C7 is True.

4) How they relate and final answer
- C8 is ""C4 holds and C7 holds."" Both C4 and C7 are True, therefore C8 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Why: C1/C5/C6 are false because the next state must contain event1 (not event2). C2 and C3 are true because event1 does occur, so C4 is true. C7 (C5 → C6) is true vacuously since C5 is false. Therefore C8 (C4 and C7) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event1 happened.
- Additional rules (from the context):
  1. After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal — once it happens, no further events can occur.)
  2. After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 happens, event1 must also happen.)

Step 2 — transition/causal rules (logical form)
- Initial: event1 = True.
- Terminal rule: event1 => (no other events can occur afterwards) — in particular, if event1 has happened, event2 cannot occur later.
- Event2 rule: event2 => event1 (i.e., if event2 happens then event1 must happen).

Because event1 already happened and is terminal, event2 cannot happen (there is no time after event1 for event2 to occur). Thus event2 is impossible in this system.

Step 3 — meaning and evaluation of each Ci
(Use classical truth values. An implication ""if A then B"" is True whenever A is False.)

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False (event1 did happen).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Requires (event2 True) and (event1 not happen). Both fail — False.
- C4: same as C3. False.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" This is (event2 => C4). Since event2 does not happen, the implication is vacuously True.
- C6: ""If C3 holds, then C5 holds."" (C3 => C5). C3 is False, so the implication is vacuously True.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C6 holds."" (event2 => C6). event2 is False, so this implication is vacuously True.
- C8: ""C1 holds and C7 holds."" C1 is False, C7 is True, so the conjunction is False.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event1 happened and prevents any later events, event2 cannot occur. That makes most conjunctions involving event2 or ""event1 does not happen"" false. Implications with event2 as antecedent are vacuously true.
- Therefore C8 (C1 and C7) is False.

Answer: C8 is False.

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context the system alternates: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, …
- C1 is just ""event1"" (true at t0, t2, …; false at t1, t3, …).
- C2 = ""always C1"" is false at every time because there are times (the event2 times) where C1 is false.
- Hence C3 (C2 at next) is false everywhere, and C4 (event2 → C3) is false at event2 times and true at event1 times.
- C5 = C4 at next is true exactly at times whose next state is an event1 time (i.e. at event2 times).
- C6 = C5 ∧ event1 requires both C5 and event1 at the same time; but C5 holds only at event2 times and event1 only at event1 times, so C6 is false everywhere.
- Therefore C7 (C6 at next) is false everywhere, C8 (""always C7"") is false, and C9 (""eventually C8"") is also false.

So C9 is False."

Reason: Initially event1 occurs, so C1 and C2 are true at the initial state.

Short answer: C9 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value)?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event2 happened and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 does occur. So C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Since C2 is true (and event1 happens), C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 does hold and event1 does happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is true and nothing can occur to invalidate it (event1 is terminal), so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Same reasoning, C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This contradicts C7, so C8 is false.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is false, the statement ""C8 does not hold"" is true. So C9 is true.

4) How the conditions relate to each other
- They are mostly nested/duplicated assertions; truth of earlier claims (that event1 must occur) cascades to make all the positive assertions true, which makes the negation C8 false and therefore C9 true.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at time/state 0: event1 occurs).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the immediate next state after event1, event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the state after event2 is terminal; no further events occur).

A possible timeline consistent with the rules:
- State 0 (initial): event1
- State 1 (next): event2
- State 2: no events (terminal)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (interpreted as: in every state/timepoint, event1 holds)
- C2: same as C1 (redundant/duplicate)
- C3: C1 or C2 (so C3 is equivalent to C1, since C1 and C2 are identical)
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state)
- C5: same as C4 (duplicate)
- C6: C4 and C5 (so C6 is equivalent to C4)

(If instead ""always"" were intended to mean ""happens at the initial state"" the labels would change — I proceed with the usual reading that ""always"" means at all times.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what's their truth value given the scenario?
- From the timeline: event1 occurs only in the initial state (state 0), then event2 occurs in state 1, and no events after that.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false (event1 does not hold in state 1 or later).
- C2 is the same, so false.
- C3 = C1 ∨ C2 is false (both disjuncts false).
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): at the next state (state 1) C3 is false, so C4 is false. C5 is the same, false.
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is false ∧ false, hence false.

Conclusion: C6 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 occurs only at the initial state, so ""event1 always happens"" (C1/C2) is false. Hence C3 is false, so C4 and C5 (C3 holding in the next state) are false, making C6 = C4 ∧ C5 false."

Short answer: C8 is True (under the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later time t1 > t0).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur again at some later time t2 > t1).
So the system forces an alternating sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the tautology A → A; it is true (it places no extra constraint).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" As a conditional, since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to asserting event2 happens. We know event2 already happened at t0, so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1 (true).
- C4: same form as C2 (true for the same reason as C2).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is true, C5 says C4 holds — and C4 does hold, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both C2 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 already holds now, the eventuality ""C6 eventually holds"" is true (it holds immediately).
- C8: ""C7 holds and event1 happens."" This requires both C7 to be true and event1 to happen (somewhen).

4) How these conditions relate and conclusion
- From the tautology C1 and the fact event2 already happened, C2 is true. C3/C4/C5 are likewise true, so C6 is true now.
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true now because C6 holds now.
- event1 will happen after the initial event2 (by the given transition), so there will be a time t1 at which event1 happens.
- At that time t1, C7 still holds (it was already true and is a global/formal fact), and event1 is happening; therefore C8 (C7 ∧ event1) is true at t1.

Possible caveat: if you interpret C7 as referring to some future time distinct from when event1 must happen and require strict simultaneity with a one-time, non-persistent truth, you might need to check the intended semantics of ""holds"" and ""eventually."" Under the usual reading (logical/tensional conditions persist and ""eventually"" is satisfied by something that already holds or will hold), C8 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 holds initially, so by the rules event1 will occur later. C2–C6 therefore hold now, so ""C6 eventually holds"" (C7) is true already. At the time event1 occurs, C7 is true and event1 holds, so C8 (C7 ∧ event1) is true."

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (so the trace contains event2).
- From that initial fact and the rules below, event1 must occur at some later point.

2) Transition/temporal rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any run in which event2 happens necessarily contains event1 later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it occurs, nothing else can occur afterward).

3) What each Ci states (informal)
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens. (Both events occur somewhere in the execution.)
- C2: If C1 holds then event1 happens. (An implication; since C1 asserts event1, this implication is trivially true.)
- C3: event1 happens and event2 happens. (Same as C1.)
- C4: If C1 holds then event1 happens. (Same as C2.)
- C5: C3 holds or C4 holds. (Either the conjunction of events holds or the implication holds.)
- C6: C5 does not hold. (Negation of C5.)
- C7: C2 holds and C6 holds. (Both the implication C2 and the negation C5 fail are required.)
- C8: C7 holds in the next state. (C7 is true one step later.)

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the context: event2 occurs and (by the rule) event1 must also occur. Therefore C1 (and C3) is true.
- Given C1 true and C1 includes event1, the implication “if C1 then event1” (C2 and C4) is also true.
- Therefore C5 = C3 or C4 is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" is therefore false.
- C7 = C2 and C6 is false because C6 is false (conjunction with a false part is false).
- C8 asserts that C7 holds in the next state. Since C7 is already false now (and nothing in the rules would make C6 become true later — the underlying facts that made C3/C4 true are global), C7 will not become true in the next state. So C8 is false.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happens (so at time 0, event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so some later point has event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Taken together (and with the initial event1), this enforces an alternating pattern: event1 at time 0, then event2, then event1, then event2, … — so event1 occurs infinitely often and there are states where event1 is false (those are the event2 states).

3) What each Ci means (interpreting them as state/temporal formulas; ¬event1 means “event1 does not hold at the current state”; F means “eventually”, G means “always”)
- C1: ¬event1 (event1 does not hold now).
- C2: ¬event1 (same as C1).
- C3: F C2 — eventually ¬event1 (there is some future state where event1 is false).
- C4: C1 ∧ C3 — now ¬event1 and eventually ¬event1.
- C5: ¬event1 (same as C1).
- C6: C4 ∨ C5 — either C4 holds or C5 holds (so effectively ¬event1 ∧ F¬event1, or just ¬event1).
- C7: G C6 — C6 holds at every state (always).
- C8: G C7 — always (always C6). (Note G G p is equivalent to G p.)
- C9: G C8 — again redundant; equivalent to G C6.

4) How they relate and truth values on the described trace
- At the initial state (time 0), event1 holds (given). Thus ¬event1 is false at time 0, so C1 and C5 are false at time 0.
- C3 (F¬event1) is true at time 0 because the next state (when event2 occurs) has ¬event1 true.
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 is false at time 0 because C1 is false.
- C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is false at time 0 (both disjuncts false).
- C7 = G C6 requires C6 to be true at every state; it is already false at time 0, so C7 is false.
- C8 and C9 are just nested G’s of the same thing and are therefore also false.

Therefore C9 is False (because C6 is false at the initial state, so “always C6” fails).

Short answer: C8 is True.

Detailed step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

A simple timeline consistent with this is:
time0: event2
time1: event1
then nothing else.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just event1 (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" i.e. eventually event1 happens.
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" a disjunction; true if either C3 is true or event1 occurs.
- C5: same as C1 (event1).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" both C4 and event1 must be true.
- C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds.""
- C8: ""C7 holds and event1 happens.""

4) How they relate (evaluation using the timeline)
- From the rules, event1 does occur (time1), so C1 (event1) is true.
- Therefore C2 and C3 (""eventually C1"") are true.
- C4 is true because C3 is true (so the disjunction holds).
- C5 is true (same as C1).
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is true (both true).
- C7 = C2 ∧ C6 is true.
- C8 = C7 ∧ event1 is true because C7 is true and event1 indeed occurs.

Thus C8 evaluates to True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: from the rules event2 → eventually event1 and event1 is terminal, so event1 does occur. That makes C1/C5 true, C2/C3 (eventually C1) true, hence C4 true, C6 true, C7 true, and therefore C8 = C7 ∧ event1 true."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so ""event2"" is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ event2).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; nothing can occur after it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction; it is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" So C2 ≡ (event2) ∨ event1.
- C3 and C4: same as C2 (they are copies).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" So C5 ≡ (C3 ⇒ C4).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" So C6 ≡ ¬C5.
- C7: ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" So C7 ≡ (C2 ⇒ C6).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From (1), event2 is true, so C1 is true.
- Since C1 is true, C2 = C3 = C4 = (true ∨ event1) = true.
- C5 is (C3 ⇒ C4) = (true ⇒ true) = true.
- C6 is ¬C5 = false.
- C7 is (C2 ⇒ C6) = (true ⇒ false) = false.

Therefore C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition from the context: event1 did happen (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur (at some later point).
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: once event1 has happened, no further events can occur.

3) Meaning of each Ci (using classical two-valued logic)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — i.e. ¬event1.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. ¬event1 holds at all times (so event1 never happens).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — C2 → event2.
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen"" — same as C1 (duplicate).
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — same as C3 (duplicate).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — C6 = C4 ∧ C5.
- C7: ""If C3 holds, then C6 holds"" — C3 → C6.

4) How these relate and truth values
- From the context, event1 did happen initially, so C1 and C4 (¬event1) are false.
- Therefore C2 (""¬event1 always"") is false (it asserts something contradicted by the initial fact).
- A conditional with a false antecedent is true in classical logic, so both C3 and C5 (C2 → event2) are true (vacuously true).
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 = (false) ∧ (true) = false.
- C3 is true but C6 is false, so C7 = (C3 → C6) = (true → false) = false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason (concise):
- C1 and C4 assert ""event1 does not happen"", but the context says event1 did happen initially, so C1 and C4 are false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 and C5 are conditionals with a false antecedent (C2), so they are true (vacuously).
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 = false ∧ true = false.
- C7 = (C3 → C6) = true → false = false."

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event2 has happened and after event2 no events can happen, so event1 will never happen.
- C1 = (event1 eventually) is false. Hence C4 (same) is false.
- C2 = (if C1 then event1) is vacuously true (antecedent false), and remains true in all future states.
- C3 = (eventually C2) is true. Therefore C5 = (C3 or C4) is true, so C6 = (eventually C5) is true.
- C7 = (C6 holds in the next state) is true (C6 holds in every state), so C8 = (eventually C7) is true.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards).
- Together these imply that, starting from the initial event1, event2 will occur, then event1 again, then event2, … (both events occur, in alternation, repeatedly).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (plainly)?
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" — both events occur (at some times).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — at every moment (globally) it is true that both events happen.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" — (C2 ⇒ event2).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" — both C3 is true and event2 occurs.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" — the negation of C4.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" — C5 is true at every moment.
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" — (C6 ⇒ event2).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" — negation of C7.
- C9: ""C8 always holds."" — C8 is true at every moment.

(We evaluate these under ordinary classical logic: implication A⇒B is true when A is false; ""always holds"" means the claim is globally true at all times; we use the transition rules and initial condition above.)

4) How do these conditions relate and their truth values?
- From the initial condition and the rules, both event1 and event2 do occur (C1 is true).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false: at the initial moment event2 has not yet occurred, so it is not true at all times that both have happened.
- C3 (C2 ⇒ event2): because C2 is false, the implication C3 is true (vacuously).
- C4 (C3 holds AND event2 happens): C3 is true and event2 does happen (by the transition rules), so C4 is true.
- C5 (C4 does not hold): false, because C4 does hold.
- C6 (C5 always holds): false, since C5 is false.
- C7 (C6 ⇒ event2): antecedent C6 is false, so C7 is true (vacuously).
- C8 (C7 does not hold): false, because C7 is true.
- C9 (C8 always holds): false, because C8 is false.

Therefore C9 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Brief chain: From the start event1 occurs and (by the rules) event2 occurs thereafter, so C1 true but not ""always"" ⇒ C2 false. Thus C3 (C2⇒event2) is true (vacuously), and since event2 occurs, C4 is true, so C5 false. Hence C6 false, so C7 true (vacuously), making C8 false and therefore C9 false."

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules (from the context)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur later (at least in some subsequent state).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: once event1 has happened, no further events can occur.

Because event1 holds initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur in the initial state or any future state of this trace.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (a redundancy).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate next state, event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future point, the next state satisfies C1 (i.e., at some time we have event2 in its next state).
- C4: same as C1 (event2 happens).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" — implication: C3 ⇒ C4.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — negation of that implication.
- C7: ""Event1 happens and C6 holds"".
- C8: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — again equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C9: ""C7 holds and C8 holds"" — both C7 and C8 true.

4) How the conditions relate (evaluation under the context)
- Because event2 cannot occur at any time (event1 already happened initially and forbids further events), C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 in the next state"") is false, and C3 (""eventually C2"") is false.
- C4 is false (same as C1).
- C5 is the implication (C3 ⇒ C4). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true (vacuously).
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold"", so C6 is false.
- C7 requires both event1 (true) and C6 (false), so C7 is false.
- C8 requires event2 (false), so C8 is false.
- Thus C9 = C7 ∧ C8 is false.

Conclusion: C9 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 holds initially and prevents any later events, so event2 (and thus C1/C2/C3/C4/C8) cannot hold; C5 is vacuously true, so C6 is false, making C7 false. Therefore C9 (C7 ∧ C8) is false."

Reasoning (concise):

- Timeline of states: S0 (initial) has event1; S1 has event2; S2 has event1; etc. (events alternate).
- C1 and C3 are just ""event1"" (true at S0, S2,...; false at S1, S3,...).
- C2 (""if event2 then C1"") is true at S0 vacuously (event2 is false there) but fails at S1 (event2 true while C1 false). So C2 does hold at the initial state S0.
- C4 is identical to C2, so C5 (C4 in the next state) at S0 demands C4 at S1, but C4 is false at S1.
- C6 at S0 is ""if C3 then C5"": C3 is true at S0, but C5 is false, so C6 is false at S0.
- C7 = always(C6) is therefore false (C6 does not hold at S0).
- C8 = (C2 -> C7) is false at S0 because C2 holds there but C7 does not.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 and C2 are tautologies (""if event1 then event1""), so C1 and C2 hold.
- C3: ""If C2 holds then event2 happens"" => since C2 holds, C3 asserts event2 happens. But initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 does not happen; therefore C3 is false.
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state) is false.
- C5 = C1 or C4 is true (because C1 is true).
- C6: ""If C5 holds then event1 happens"" is true (event1 did happen initially).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" is true (C6 already holds).
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" is therefore false.
- C9: ""C8 always holds"" is false (C8 itself is false).

Short answer: C9 is False.

I'll show why step by step, using the usual temporal logic convention that the ""next"" operator is false in a state that has no successor (i.e., terminal states have no next state).

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.
- Transition rules: after event1, no other events can happen (state is terminal); after event2, no other events can happen (state is terminal).

2) Transition behavior
- Because the initial state already has event2 and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" the initial state is terminal: there is no successor (no further states, no further events possible).
- Thus any ""next"" (X) formula evaluated in the initial state is false.

3) Meaning and evaluation of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Equivalent to ""event2 happens."" This is true in the initial state (event2 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). Since C1 already holds now, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). There is no next state (initial state is terminal), so X C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). Same reason as above: false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" (¬C4). Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). No next state, so false.
- C7: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Same as C1, so true.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds"" (C6 ∨ C7). With C6 false and C7 true, C8 is true.
- C9: ""Event1 happens and C8 holds"" (event1 ∧ C8). C8 is true, but event1 does not happen in any state (initial has event2 and is terminal), so ""event1 happens"" is false. Therefore C9 is false.

4) How they relate (compact summary)
- True: C1, C2, C5, C7, C8
- False: C3, C4, C6, C9
- Final conclusion: C9 is false because event1 never occurs (initial state has event2 and is terminal), even though C8 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: the initial state has event2 and is terminal, so any X-formula is false. That makes C7 (same as C1) true and C8 true, but event1 never occurs, so ""event1 ∧ C8"" (C9) is false."

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: in the initial state S0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen → in the next state S1, event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → S1 is terminal (no events in S2 and later).

(So the timeline: S0: event2; S1: event1; S2+: no events.)

3) What each sub-condition means (evaluated in the initial state S0, unless otherwise stated)
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" — means both hold in the same state. In S0 event2 is true but event1 is false → C1 is False.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — check S1: S1 has event1 but not event2, so C1 is False in S1 → C2 is False (as evaluated in S0).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is already False in S0, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — True (because C3 is False).
- C5: same as C1 → False.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" → True AND False → False.
- C7: ""C1 holds in the next state"" → same as C2 → False.
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds"" → False OR False → False.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- Given the timeline implied by the rules, C6 and C7 are both false, so their disjunction C8 is false.

Note on interpretation: this answer assumes ""happens"" is a state property (an event holds in a particular state). If instead ""happens"" were interpreted as ""occurs somewhere along the execution (eventually or at some time in the trace)"", some Ci truth-values could change (e.g. both event2 and event1 occur in the trace), but under the standard state-based reading used above, C8 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Interpreting ""happens"" as a state property, S0 has event2 only and S1 has event1 only, so C1 is false (no state has both events). That makes C2, C5, C7 false; C3 false and thus C4 true; C6 = C4 AND C5 = false; therefore C8 = C6 OR C7 = false."

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Additional context: once event2 has happened, no other events can happen afterward (event2 is terminal).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, nothing else can happen (no further event1 or event2).
- If event1 happens at some point, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 → eventually event2).

3) Meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (event1 holds at all times).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is a time from which event1 holds always).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (¬C2).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens"" (¬C2 ∧ event1).
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens"" (¬C2 ∧ event1 ∧ event2).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" (¬C5).
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens"" (C6 → event2).
- C8: ""Event1 always happens"" (same as C1).
- C9: ""If C7 holds, then C8 holds"" (C7 → C8).

4) How these conditions relate — truth values given the context
- Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, event1 never happens at any time. Therefore:
  - C1 (event1 always happens): false.
  - C2 (C1 eventually holds): false (C1 never becomes true).
  - C3 (¬C2): true.
  - C4 (C3 ∧ event1): false (event1 is false).
  - C5 (C4 ∧ event2): false (C4 false).
  - C6 (¬C5): true.
  - C7 (C6 → event2): true, because C6 is true and event2 does indeed happen (it happened initially).
  - C8 (event1 always happens): false (same as C1).
  - C9 (C7 → C8): false, because C7 is true while C8 is false, so the implication is false.

Conclusion: C9 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs initially and is terminal, so event1 never holds (C8 false). C6 is true and event2 holds, so C7 is true. Thus C7 → C8 is false (true antecedent, false consequent)."

- After event2, event1 must happen. (So from event2 we deduce event1.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal; nothing comes after it.)

From these two rules and the initial condition we can conclude: event2 happened and therefore event1 happened.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens (E2 ∧ E1).
- C2: same as C1 (E2 ∧ E1).
- C3: same as C1 (E2 ∧ E1).
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds (C2 ∨ C3). Since C2 and C3 are identical to C1, C4 is equivalent to C1.
- C5: If C1 holds, then C4 holds (C1 → C4). Given C4 ≡ C1, this implication is true (in fact it is trivially true because C1 implies C1).
- C6: C2 holds or C3 holds (C2 ∨ C3), same as C4.
- C7: C5 holds and C6 holds (C5 ∧ C6).

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the context we have E2 true and therefore E1 true, so C1 (E2 ∧ E1) is true. Hence C2 and C3 are also true.
- Therefore C4 and C6 (C2 ∨ C3) are true.
- C5 (C1 → C4) is true (and in this case its antecedent and consequent are true).
- Thus C7 = C5 ∧ C6 is true ∧ true, so C7 is True.

Answer: C7 is True.

Answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: if event1 occurs, the run stops (no further events).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal as well: if event2 occurs, the run stops.
- Since event2 occurred initially, the system is already in a terminal state with no further events possible.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is an implication. Because C1 is true (event2 did happen), the implication is true regardless of whether event1 happens or not.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Means C2 is true at every point in the execution. There are no future points where the truth value can change (run is terminal), and C2 is already true now, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (same as C2) — true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Same reasoning as for C3: C5 is true now and cannot become false later, so C6 holds.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Again true.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" This claims C7 is false.

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation
- Starting from C1 true, each implication and ""always"" assertion remains true in the terminal execution. Therefore C7 is true.
- C8 asserts the negation of C7, so C8 is false.

Conclusion: C8 is False.

False

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reasoning (evaluating formulas at the initial state t0):

- Timeline from the context: t0: event2. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", t1: event1. By ""after event1, no other events can happen"", no events occur at t2 and thereafter.

- C1 (event2 in the next state): asks whether event2 occurs at t1 — it does not (t1 has event1). So C1 is false. C2 is the same as C1, so also false.

- C3 (C2 eventually holds): this requires some future state k where C2 holds (i.e., at k+1 event2). There are no further occurrences of event2 after t0, so C3 is false.

- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 is therefore false. C5 says C4 holds in the next state (i.e., C4 at t1) — but C4 is false at t1, so C5 is false.

- C6 (C5 always holds) is false because C5 is already false at t0. Thus C7 (C6 does not hold) is true at t0.

- C8 (C7 holds in the next state): C7 is also true at t1 (C6 is false from any state onward, so ""C6 does not hold"" holds at t1), so C8 is true at t0.

- C9 (C8 does not hold) is therefore false (since C8 is true).

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, the next required occurrence is event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Together these force an alternation: starting from event1, event2 must occur next, then event1, then event2, … so both events occur (in fact infinitely often).

3) What each Ci means (using the natural reading in the hypothesis)
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens (i.e., both events occur).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: If C2 holds then C3 holds. Since C2 and C3 are identical propositions, C4 is a tautology (P → P), hence true.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state. Since C4 is always true, C5 is true (on whatever next state exists).
- C6: C5 always holds. (Given as a condition in the chain; it follows from C4 being true in all states.)
- C7: C6 eventually holds. If C6 always holds then it certainly eventually holds, so C7 is true.
- C8: C1 holds or C7 holds. We already have C7 true, so C8 is true.
- C9: C8 does not hold (i.e., ¬C8).

4) How they relate / final derivation
- From the transition rules + initial event1, both events occur, so C1 (and hence C2/C3) is true as well.
- C4–C7 are all true as explained.
- C8 = C1 ∨ C7 is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).
- Therefore C9, which asserts ¬C8, is false.

Conclusion: C9 is False.

Short answer: C7 is True (given the usual temporal semantics described below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (the trace starts with a state where event2 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., any state that has event1 is followed by a state with event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen — that makes any state with event2 terminal (no successor state where events occur).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” (Globally/eventually? Interpreting “always” as the usual temporal operator G: event1 holds in every state of the trace.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” Interpreted as the implication C1 ⇒ event1 (i.e., if event1 holds always, then in the current state event1 holds). Logically this is an implication about the current state.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” (Next-time operator X C2.)
- C4: “C2 holds in the next state.” (Same as C3 as written; so C3 and C4 are the same proposition here.)
- C5: “C3 or C4.” (Disjunction of the two identical next-state claims; therefore equivalent to C3.)
- C6: “C5 always holds.” (Globally, at every state C5 is true.)
- C7: “C6 does not hold.” (Negation of C6.)

(Assumption: we use standard linear-time temporal logic semantics where X φ (next φ) is false in a state with no successor, and G φ (always φ) means φ holds in every state of the trace.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final evaluation)?
- Because the initial state has event2 and event2 is terminal, there is no reachable state after the initial state in which any events occur. In particular, event1 never occurs anywhere in the trace. So:
  - C1 (event1 always happens) is false.
  - C2 (C1 ⇒ event1) is true: an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously).
  - C3 and C4 assert that C2 holds in the next state. But there is no next state after the terminal event2, so X C2 is false at the initial state under standard semantics. Therefore C3 = C4 = false.
  - C5 = C3 ∨ C4 is false.
  - C6 = G C5 (“C5 always holds”) is false (already false at the initial state).
  - C7 = ¬C6 is therefore true.

Conclusion: C7 is True (given the usual interpretation of “next” and “always” and the described transition rules).

I'll treat ""holds"" as ""is true in the current situation"" and evaluate the given statements in that situation.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Also given: after event2, event1 must happen. And after event1 no other events can happen.

So in the actual timeline: event2 happened, and therefore event1 will (and does) happen after it. Both event2 and event1 are true in the situation; event1 is terminal (no further events after it).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- From the context: event2 ⇒ event1 (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 will occur afterwards).
- event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs nothing else can occur.
- There is no rule preventing event2 from having occurred initially, and it did.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value?
Evaluate each Ci in the current situation:

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally event1 → event2.
  - In our situation event1 is true and event2 is true (event2 happened initially), so the implication is true. Therefore C1 = True.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally C1 → event1.
  - C1 is true and event1 is true, so C2 = True.

- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Formally C2 ∧ event2.
  - C2 is true and event2 is true, so C3 = True.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Formally ¬C3.
  - C3 is true, so C4 = False.

- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as asserting C4 is true (i.e., C4 holds).
  - C4 is false, so C5 = False.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Formally ¬C5.
  - C5 is false, so C6 = True.

- C7: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (same form as C2: C1 → event1)
  - As with C2, this is true, so C7 = True.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is C8?
- C8: ""C6 holds or C7 holds."" Formally C6 ∨ C7.
  - We found C6 = True and C7 = True, so the disjunction is True.

Final answer: C8 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 has happened.

(Interpretation note: I read each “After X, Y must happen” as a guarantee that whenever X occurs, Y will occur later on that same run — i.e. a liveness requirement “whenever X then eventually Y”. The conclusion is the same if “after” means “in the next state”.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterward (event1 occurs at some later point).
- Whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen afterward.
Given the initial event2, these rules force an infinite alternation: event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, … — so event1 occurs (infinitely) many times.

3) What each sub-condition means (paraphrase)
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens” (there is a future state with event1).
- C2: same as C1 (redundant).
- C3: “C2 does not hold” (i.e. it is not the case that event1 will happen).
- C4: “Eventually C3 holds” (at some future state C2 is false).
- C5: same as C1/C2.
- C6: C4 AND C5.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.”
- C8: C1 AND C7.
- C9: “C8 always holds” (at every state C8 is true).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation under the model
- From the rules and the initial event2, event1 does eventually happen and in fact will keep happening infinitely often. So C1, C2, C5 are true (at the initial state and at every state there remains a future event1).
- C3 = not C2 is therefore false (because C2 is true).
- C4 = “eventually C3” is false, because C3 is never true (C2 never becomes false under the enforced alternation).
- C6 = C4 and C5 = false and true = false.
- C7 = “next(C6)” = false (next state also has C6 false).
- C8 = C1 and C7 = true and false = false.
- C9 = “always C8” = false, because C8 is already false at the initial state (and hence not true at all states).

Therefore C9 is false.

(If instead the “must happen” rules were not guarantees but mere possibilities, the truth values could differ; under the natural reading as obligations that enforce alternating occurrences, C9 is false.)

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the initial state.
- Transition rules (interpreting ""after X, Y must happen"" as the system must next produce Y after X): after event1 the next state has event2, and after event2 the next state has event1. Thus the state sequence is event1, event2, event1, event2, … (event1 recurs infinitely often).

2) Transition rules between events
- The rules enforce strict alternation: every occurrence of event1 is followed by event2, and every event2 is followed by event1. With event1 at the start, event1 occurs at every even-positioned state (0,2,4,…) and event2 at odd positions (1,3,5,…).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1, C2, C3: each asserts “event1 eventually happens” (i.e., there is some present or future state where event1 occurs). Given the alternation, event1 indeed occurs repeatedly.
- C4: C2 ∨ C3. Since C2 and C3 are the same, C4 is true exactly when C2 (or C3) is true.
- C5: ¬C4 (C4 does not hold).
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state” (next(¬C4)).
- C7: C1 ∧ C6.
- C8: always(C7) (C7 holds at every state).
- C9: next(C8) (C8 holds in the next state).

4) How the conditions relate and truth-values
- Because event1 recurs forever, C1, C2, C3 are true in every state.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is true in every state.
- Hence C5 = ¬C4 is false in every state.
- C6 (next(¬C4)) is false in every state (the next state also has C4 true).
- C7 = C1 ∧ C6 is false (C6 is false).
- C8 = always(C7) is false (C7 does not hold).
- C9 = next(C8) is false (the next state does not satisfy C8).

Conclusion: C9 is False. (This conclusion is robust under the usual interpretations of “eventually” and “after” that produce the enforced alternation; the alternation makes event1 inevitable, so the negated disjunctions/nexts cause the chain to fail, yielding C9 = False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1–C3 are true (event1 recurs), so C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is true, hence C5 = ¬C4 is false, so C6 = next(C5) is false, C7 = C1 ∧ C6 is false, C8 = always(C7) is false, and therefore C9 = next(C8) is false."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Transition rules (from the context): after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen.

2) Transition rules between events
- From event1 → event2 must occur (so given event1 happened, event2 will occur subsequently).
- After event2 no further events occur.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the initial condition (event1 did happen), so C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" That is event1 ∨ ¬event1, which is a tautology, so C2 is True (it holds regardless).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is True, C3 is True.
- C4: identical form to C3, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 is a tautology (True), it holds in every state, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the implication C5 → event2. We have C5 True, and from the context (event1 happened and after event1 event2 must happen) event2 does happen, so the implication is True.
- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" We have C3 = True and C6 = True, so C7 = True.

4) How they relate
- Although C1 is false, the use of OR in C2 makes C2 true anyway; that truth propagates to C3 and C4. C5 is true because C4 is always true. With C5 true and the context forcing event2 after event1, C6 is true. Therefore both conjuncts of C7 are true, so C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C2 is a tautology (event1 ∨ ¬event1) so C3 and C4 hold; C4 therefore holds in the next state (C5). Given the rule that after event1 event2 must occur, C6 (C5 → event2) is satisfied, so C3 ∧ C6 (C7) is true."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
Because event2 already happened, no further events can occur after the initial moment.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 does not occur.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there will be a time at which C1 is true)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" (C2 ∨ event2)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (¬C3)
- C5: same as C4 (¬C3)
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" (¬C3 ∧ ¬C3, i.e. ¬C3)

4) Evaluate and relate them
- Because event2 happened initially, the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false (event2 did happen). Even under alternate readings (e.g. ""event2 will not occur again""), the crucial facts below still follow.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false if C1 is false now and never becomes true later (no future events change that); under any reasonable reading it does not make C2 true in a way that affects the final result.
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2. Since event2 did happen, C3 is true.
- C4 = ¬C3, so C4 is false.
- C5 = ¬C3, so C5 is false.
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 = false ∧ false = false.

Therefore C6 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Taken together the only possible execution consistent with the rules is: event2 occurs first, then event1, then no further events.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (read as: event2 occurs at all times / in every state — i.e. not merely initially but always)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of C1)
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens.""
- C4: ""C1 does not hold."" (same as C2)
- C5: ""Event2 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" (i.e. (not C1) or (C1))
- C7: ""C6 does not hold.""
- C8: ""C3 holds and C7 holds.""

(Note: C2 and C4 are the same statement; C1 and C5 are the same.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth evaluation
- Is C1 true? No. Because event2 occurs initially but not “always” (after event1 no events occur), so the claim that event2 always happens is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.
- event2 does happen (initially), so C3 = (C2 true) and (event2 happens) = true.
- C4 = C1 does not hold = true (same as C2).
- C5 = event2 always happens = false (same as C1).
- C6 = C4 or C5 = true or false = true.
- C7 = not C6 = false.
- C8 = C3 and C7 = true and false = false.

Conclusion: C8 is False.

(If you intended a different formal reading of ""always happens"" — e.g. ""event2 occurs at least once"" or ""event2 eventually happens in every run"" — the truth values could change; with the natural reading above C8 is false.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” Interpreting literally: once event2 has happened (at some state), no events occur in any future state.
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” Interpreting as: if event1 happens at some state, then event2 will happen in the (immediate) next state.

Step 3 — meaning of the C-conditions (use X for “in the next state”)
- C1 = X(event1) — “event1 happens in the next state.”
- C2 = X(C1) = X^2(event1) — “event1 happens two states ahead.”
- C3 = X(C2) = X^3(event1) — “event1 happens three states ahead.”
- C4 = X(C3) = X^4(event1) — “event1 happens four states ahead.”
- C5 = X(C3) = X^4(event1) — (same as C4)
- C6 = C4 OR C5 = X^4(event1) OR X^4(event1) = X^4(event1) — so C6 is equivalent to “event1 happens four states ahead.”

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value
- Because event2 has occurred in S0 and the rule “after event2, no other events can happen” forbids any events in all future states, no occurrence of event1 is possible in S1, S2, S3, S4, ...
- Therefore C1 is false, and so are C2, C3, C4, C5.
- Since C4 and C5 are false, their disjunction C6 is false.

- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- Additional constraints from the context: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So as soon as event1 (or event2) has occurred, the system enters a terminal situation where no further events occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- The rules say that event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has happened, there can be no subsequent events. Since event1 already happened initially, no subsequent event (in particular event2) can ever happen after that. The system proceeds to states with no new events.

(Implicit assumption used: events are not both required to have happened simultaneously at the same instant; the relevant reading is that after an occurrence of event1 no later state can have any new events. That makes event2 impossible after the initial event1.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, event1 happens but event2 cannot happen after event1, so C1 is False.
- C2: Same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are False, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is never true now or later, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false in every state, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false in every state, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Negation of False → C7 is True.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" C7 is true now and remains true in all future states (nothing changes), so C8 is True.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Negation of True → C9 is False.

4) How these conditions relate (summary)
- Because event1 occurs initially and is terminal, event2 never occurs. That makes any conjunction requiring both events false (C1, C2), which cascades to C3–C6 being false. Their negations produce C7 true, C8 true, and hence C9 false.

Final answer: C9 is False.

Short answer: C7 is True (vacuously), given the usual reading below. Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the initial state (call it time 0).

(Assumption: “X happens” means X occurs at some point in the execution/trace. “Holds in the next state” means true at the state immediately after the current one. “Eventually” means true at some future state.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen: from a trace containing event1, event2 will occur later (event2 is guaranteed after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen: event2 is terminal; once event2 occurs no further events occur.

So a canonical trace given the context is: event1 at time 0, then at some later time event2, then stop.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and how to evaluate them on that trace?
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event1 happens.” On our trace event2 does happen and event1 also happens (earlier), so the implication is true.
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds.” Event1 does happen, and we just saw C1 holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” At the state immediately after the initial one, event1 might no longer be true at that state, but C1 is a global fact that still holds, so C2 is true there; hence C3 is true.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” C3 already holds in the immediate next state, so C4 is true.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” This is the negation of C4, so it is false.
- C6: “C2 holds in the next state.” This is the same factual claim as C3; it is true.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C7 true?
- C7: “If C5 holds, then C6 holds.” C5 is false (we found C4 true), so the implication “if C5 then C6” is true vacuously in classical logic. Therefore C7 is True.

Note on alternative readings: If you read C1 as requiring event1 and event2 to occur simultaneously at the same state (rather than “event1 occurs somewhere in the trace whenever event2 occurs somewhere”), then C1 would be false in the canonical trace (event1 occurs at time 0, event2 later). That would flip truth values of some intermediate C's, but C7 would still be true if C5 remains false; if semantics change so that C5 becomes true, you would need to re-evaluate C6 to decide C7. Under the usual temporal-trace reading above, C7 is True.

Reasoning (brief):
- Timeline from the context: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, ... (they alternate forever).
- e2 is true at even times (t0,t2,...) and false at odd times; e1 is true at odd times.

Evaluate the Ci at t0 (initial state), using standard LTL-style meanings (G = always, F = eventually, X = next):
- C1 = ""event2 always happens"" (G e2) → false (e2 is false at t1).
- C2 = C1 ∨ e2 → false ∨ true = true (e2 holds at t0).
- C3 = ¬C2 → false.
- C4 = X C3 → C3 at t1 is true (since C2 is false at t1), so C4 = true at t0.
- C5 = C4 ∨ e1 → true ∨ false = true at t0 (and in fact C5 is true at every state).

Summary answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially (so the trace starts with event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From these rules and the initial condition, the only possible finite trace is: event2 → event1 → (end).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (interpreting them in the natural temporal/invariant sense)?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (A direct statement of Rule A.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true at all times / is an invariant.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (There is some time at which C2 holds; if C2 holds always, it certainly holds eventually.)
- C4: ""C1 always holds."" (Same as C2, repeated.)
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" (Both the eventual holding of C2 and the invariant C1.)
- C6: ""C1 always holds."" (Same again.)
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" (Combines the previous conjuncts.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From Rule A, C1 is true: whenever event2 occurs it is (by the system rule) followed by event1.
- Given the system rules are global, C1 is an invariant, so ""C1 always holds"" is true. Thus C2 and C4 and C6 (which repeat that) are true.
- If C2 is true (always), then ""C2 eventually holds"" is also true (something true always is certainly true at some future time), so C3 is true.
- Therefore C5 (C3 and C4) is true, and with C6 true, C7 (C5 and C6) is true.

Conclusion: Every component required by C7 holds under the given rules and initial condition, so C7 is True.

(Note: this reasoning assumes the natural reading that the given rules are global/operational constraints of the system — in that reading C1 is an invariant. If you intended a different formal semantics for ""always"" or ""eventually,"" state that and I can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened (so event2 holds in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, then the following state/event is event2).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — once event2 has happened, there are no further events/states with events).

Given the initial state already has event2, rule B means no events occur in any later state (there are no later events). In particular, event1 never occurs anywhere in the execution.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting ""always"" as a global property and ""in the next state"" as the usual next-time operator)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — false, since event1 never occurs at all (initial is event2 and that blocks any further events).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — false (C1 is false now and remains false in the next state).
- C3: same as C1 — false.
- C4: same as C1 — false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" — this is an implication p → p; since C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true. So C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — false, because C5 does hold.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — false (C6 is false, so it cannot hold always).
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state"" — false.
- C9: ""C2 holds or C8 holds"" — false OR false = False.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because the system starts in event2 and no further events can occur, any claim that event1 ""always happens"" (or holds at any time) is false. That makes all occurrences of C1/C3/C4 false, makes the implication C5 vacuously true, and causes the chain that follows (C6–C8) to be false. Therefore C2 and C8 are both false, so their disjunction C9 is false.

Final answer: C9 is False.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules (what must follow what?)
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Combined, these force an alternating sequence of events. Given event2 happened initially, the timeline is
  time 0: event2,
  time 1: event1,
  time 2: event2,
  time 3: event1,
  …
So event2 occurs infinitely often (at times 0,2,4,...).

3) Meaning of each Ci and their truth values under the timeline
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Since event2 happens at time 0 (and later times), C1 is false at the initial time (and if interpreted as a global claim “event2 never happens,” that is also false).
- C2: same as C1 → false.
- C3: “C2 always holds” i.e. “event2 never happens (at all times).” False because event2 does happen repeatedly.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” i.e. “there is a future time after which event2 never happens.” False: event2 continues to occur infinitely often, so there is no suffix where event2 never happens.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” This is just eventually(eventually always ¬event2) which reduces to eventually(always ¬event2) (or at least is no easier to satisfy than C4). Given C4 is false at all times, C5 is false.
- C6: “C1 holds and C5 holds.” Both conjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 holds and event2 happens.” C6 is false, so C7 is false.
- C8: “C7 always holds” — false because C7 is false (it never holds).
- C9: “C8 eventually holds” — false because C8 never holds.

4) How they relate
- Many Ci assert “event2 never happens” (C1, C2, C3). The system forces event2 to occur infinitely often, so any claim that event2 never happens (or that from some point on it never happens) is false. That falsity propagates through the later Ci (conjunctions, always, eventually), so none of the later claims become true. Therefore C9 is false.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur after that initial event2).
- The context also states the rule: ""After event1, event2 must happen.""

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen (a rule from the context).
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal (no events after it), event1 cannot happen after that initial event2; whether event1 happened before that is unspecified and unnecessary for the logical conclusions below.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (tautologically redundant).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — i.e., if event1 happens then event2 happens. This matches the context rule, so C2 is entailed by the context.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold"" — same as C3 (duplicate).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — negation of C4; since C4 says ""C2 does not hold"", C5 effectively says ""C2 holds"".
- C6: ""C3 holds or C5 holds"" — i.e. ""not C2 or C2"", which is a tautology (always true).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — the negation of C6.

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- From the context, C2 is true (the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” is given).
- Therefore C3 and C4 (which assert ""C2 does not hold"") are false.
- C5 (negation of C4) is true (so it also asserts C2).
- C6 = C3 or C5 = false or true = true (tautologically true anyway).
- C7 = negation of C6 = negation of true = False.

Thus C7 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means once we are in the state where event1 has happened there are no further event occurrences (no transitions that produce new events).
- Therefore, after the initial state there are no further events; in particular event2 never occurs at any future time.

2) Transition rules between events
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — whenever event2 occurs, the next event must be event1. (This rule is vacuously satisfied here because event2 never occurs.)
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — the state with event1 is terminal: there are no subsequent event occurrences.

3) Meaning of each Ci
(Interpretation used: “always” = holds in every state from now on; “eventually” = holds at some time now or in the future; “next” = holds in the immediate successor state; if no successor state exists, “next” is false.)
- C1: “event1 happens and event2 happens” — requires both events to occur (somewhere).
- C2: “C1 always holds” — C1 must hold in every state.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — negation of C2.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” — C3 holds now or at some future time.
- C5: “C1 always holds” — same as C2.
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds” — conjunction of C4 and C5.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state” — C6 must be true in the immediate successor state.
- C8: “C7 always holds” — C7 must hold in every state.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the initial conditions, event2 never occurs. So C1 (requires event2) is false.
- C2 (C1 always) is therefore false.
- C3 = “C2 does not hold” is true.
- C4 = “C3 eventually holds” is true (in fact C3 holds already in the initial state).
- C5 is the same as C2, so C5 is false.
- C6 = C4 and C5 = true and false = false.
- C7 = “C6 in the next state” is false (there is no next state with events, or if a next state were considered, C6 is false there).
- C8 = “C7 always” is false (because C7 is false).

Therefore C8 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means the state reached after event1 is terminal: there are no further transitions/events.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards.)

Given the initial condition (event1 already happened) plus “after event1 no other events can happen”, event2 cannot occur at any later time in this run (there is no later time).

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (and evaluate them under the given run)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Since event2 cannot happen, C1 = True.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1) → C2 = True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 = False.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" (same as C3) → C4 = False.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are False → C5 = False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (state after event1 is terminal). Under the standard interpretation of the next operator (X p is false in a terminal state), C6 = False.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is True and C6 is False, so the implication is False. Thus C7 = False.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" Since C7 is already false in the initial (and only) state, C8 = False.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 are identical and true because event2 cannot occur.
- C3 and C4 assert the negation of C2, so they are false.
- C5 is the disjunction of two false statements, so false.
- C6 requires that false C5 holds in a next state; with no next state, C6 is false.
- C7 is a conditional from a true antecedent to a false consequent, so false.
- C8 fails because C7 does not hold in the current state.

Note on semantics: If you used a nonstandard semantics where ""X p"" (holds in the next state) is treated differently at terminal states (e.g., considered vacuously true), the truth of C6 and thus C7/C8 could change. Under the usual temporal-logic semantics (X p false at terminal states), C8 is false.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initially, event2 happened → E2 = True.

2) What are the transition rules?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: if E1 occurs then nothing else can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal.
Given E2 happens initially, no other events can happen after that, so E1 cannot occur (there is no time for it to happen).

So from the context we take E1 = False, E2 = True.

3) What each sub-condition means (write each as a Boolean formula):
- C1: Event1 does not happen = ¬E1.
- C2: Event1 does not happen = ¬E1 (same as C1).
- C3: C2 does not hold = ¬C2 = ¬(¬E1) = E1.
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds = ¬E1 ∨ E1 (this is a tautology = True).
- C5: C2 does not hold = same as C3 = E1.
- C6: Event1 happens or C5 holds = E1 ∨ E1 = E1.
- C7: If C4 holds, then C6 holds = C4 → C6. Since C4 is True, C7 is equivalent to C6 (so C7 ↔ E1).
- C8: If event2 happens, then C7 holds = E2 → C7.

4) How these relate and final evaluation with the context (E2 = True, E1 = False):
- C1 = ¬E1 = True.
- C2 = True.
- C3 = E1 = False.
- C4 = True (tautology).
- C5 = E1 = False.
- C6 = E1 = False.
- C7 = C4 → C6 = True → False = False.
- C8 = E2 → C7 = True → False = False.

Therefore C8 is False. (If you allowed an alternative timeline where E1 happened before the ""initially"" E2, you would need to state that explicitly; with the given wording E2 initially happened and both events are terminal, so E1 cannot happen.)

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Given the initial event1 and these rules, event2 will happen (and then nothing further).

3) What each sub-condition means and its truth value
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 happened and that forces event2, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is True and event2 does happen, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is True and event1 did happen initially, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" This is the same condition as C3, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" C4 is False, C5 is True, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is True, C7 is False.

4) How they relate
- The chain of implications and the initial event1 make C1–C3 (and C5) true, which makes C4 false; C6 is true by the disjunction with C5, so C7 (the negation of C6) is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen in the next state.
- Whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen in the next state.
(So the system enforces an alternation between event1 and event2.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (call this X(event1))
- C2: same as C1 (X(event1))
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" (event2 ∨ X(event1))
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" (X(event1) → (event2 ∨ X(event1)))
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (G(C4) — C4 is true in every state)
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" (¬G(C4))
- C7: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" (same as C3)
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" (¬G(C4) ∧ (event2 ∨ X(event1)))

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Note C1 and C2 are identical, so C4 is the implication X(event1) → (event2 ∨ X(event1)). But (A → (B ∨ A)) is a tautology: whenever A is true, (B ∨ A) is automatically true because A is one of the disjuncts. Thus C4 is true in every state.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.
- C6 (¬C5) is therefore false.
- C7 is either true because event2 holds in the initial state (or because X(event1) may hold); in any case C7 can be true, but it doesn't matter.
- C8 is C6 ∧ C7. Since C6 is false, the conjunction is false.

Hence C8 is False.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
(So whichever of event1 or event2 happens, it is terminal; here event2 has already happened, so no further events can occur.)

(Assumption about temporal operators) I read ""eventually"" as: holds at some time ≥ now (so if it already holds now, it counts). I read ""always"" as: holds at every time ≥ now.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event2 happened initially and the rules say no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen at any future time. There is no way to have event1 occur (it did not occur initially, and nothing can occur after event2).

3) Meaning / evaluation of each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Since event2 happened initially, C1 is True now.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds now, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" C2 is True but event1 does not and cannot happen (blocked by the initial event2), so ""event1 happens"" is False; therefore C3 is False.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" C3 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is False, C5 is True.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" This implication is True because C5 is True (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds now, so C7 is True.
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" C6 and hence C7 are true now and remain true at every future time (no events will occur to change truths), so C8 is True.
- C9: ""C8 does not hold."" Since C8 is True, C9 is False.

4) Relations and final result
- The chain of implications and modal operations yields the truth values: C1 True, C2 True, C3 False, C4 False, C5 True, C6 True, C7 True, C8 True, C9 False.
- Therefore C9 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Formally: event1 → event2.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 occurs, no event1 can occur afterwards.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: event2 → event1.
- C2: event2 → event1. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 ∧ C2 (so equivalent to C1).
- C4: If C3 holds then event1 happens. (C3 → event1)
- C5: C4 always holds. (C4 is true)
- C6: C1 ∧ C2 (same as C3)
- C7: C5 ∧ C6.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- The context gives event1 → event2, but it does not give event2 → event1. There is no rule that forces event1 to have occurred whenever event2 occurs. Indeed, the context allows event2 to occur without a preceding event1 (and the initial state is exactly such a case).
- Example model consistent with the context: at time 0 event2 happened and event1 did not happen at any time. This satisfies both context rules: it doesn't contradict ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (there was no event1) and it respects ""after event2 no other events"" (no event1 after event2).
- Therefore C1 (and C2) are false in the given context.
- C3 and C6 are false (they are C1 ∧ C2).
- C4 (C3 → event1) is vacuously true because C3 is false. So C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.
- C7 = C5 ∧ C6 = True ∧ False = False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. So from the initial event1, event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This creates mutual triggering, but what matters is that event2 does indeed occur.)

Conclusion from steps 1–2: event2 happens.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is False, C3 = True.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So from any state where event2 has just occurred, event1 will occur next — or at least it must occur; the exact timing won't change the conclusion below.)
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a proposition about the next-state)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 = ¬(¬C1) = C1.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold"" = same as C3 = C1.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬C4 = ¬C1 = C2.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds"" = C3 ∧ C5 = C1 ∧ C2 = C1 ∧ ¬C1.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" = ♦C6 (there is some future state where C6 is true).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the reductions above, C6 is C1 ∧ ¬C1, a contradiction that is false in every state (it cannot be true in any single state because it requires C1 and its negation simultaneously).
- Therefore there is no state in which C6 is true, so ""eventually C6"" (C7) is false.

Note: This conclusion is independent of whether ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is interpreted as ""immediately next state"" or ""eventually"" — C6 still requires a proposition and its negation to hold in the same state, which is impossible. Hence C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is True (under the standard reading below). Explanation step by step.

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happens.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. any state following an event2 must have event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (i.e. once event1 has occurred, there are no further event transitions that produce any other event).

A consequence of these rules plus the initial condition: since event1 holds initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no future states in which event2 (or any other event) can occur.

3) What each sub-condition means (informal)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — just equivalent to ""event1 happens"" in the current state. So C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — requires that event1 hold in the next state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — at some future point C3 becomes true.
- C5: ""C2 always holds"" — same as C3 (repetition).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — both of those must be true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — the negation of C6.

4) How the conditions relate and final truth values
Use the transition rules and initial condition:

- C1 is true in the initial state (event1 holds).
- Because ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" there is no meaningful next state in which a new event occurs. Under the usual reading that ""after event1"" stops further event transitions, we cannot conclude a next-state occurrence of event1; so C2 is false (there is no next-state C1).
- If C2 is false, then ""C2 always holds"" (C3 and C5) is false.
- If C3 is false, ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is false.
- Therefore C6 (C4 and C5) is false.
- Hence C7, ""C6 does not hold"", is true.

(Alternative reading: if you instead interpret ""no other events can happen"" to allow stuttering of the same event1 into subsequent states so that event1 holds in the next state as well, then C2 would be true, and that would make C3,C4,C5,C6 all true and C7 false. But with the natural reading that event1 is terminal and there is no next-state occurrence of a new event, C7 is true.)

Conclusion: Under the standard/most natural interpretation, C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 holds initially. Because after event1 no further events occur, there is no next-state occurrence of C1, so C2 is false. Hence C3 and C5 (""C2 always holds"") are false, making C4 false as well, so C6 is false and therefore C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true."

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, the next state must have event1).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, no future state can have any event).

Because the initial state already has event1, Rule B prevents event2 (or any other event) from ever occurring in any future state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (True in a state iff its immediate successor state has event2.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (There exists some future state where C1 is true; equivalently, at some point the next state contains event2 — i.e. event2 occurs at some future time.)
- C3: same as C2 (the statement is repeated).
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (C2 → C3; here C2 and C3 are identical.)
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" (disjunction)
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" (C5 is true at every state)
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" (negation of C6)
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state.""

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 never occurs. Therefore:
  - C1 is false at the initial state (and at every state) because the next state never contains event2.
  - C2 and C3 are false (there is no future point where C1 holds).
  - C4 (C2 → C3) is true at every state: an implication with equal antecedent/consequent is true (in particular when both are false, the implication is true).
  - C5 is true at every state because C4 holds (so the disjunction ""event1 or C4"" is true even in states where event1 doesn't happen).
  - Hence C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true.
  - C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is false.
  - C8 (""C7 holds in the next state"") is therefore false.

Conclusion: C8 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Rules: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. (So event1 cannot occur after event2.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either occurs, no further events occur afterward.
- In particular, because event2 happened initially, event1 cannot happen at any later state.

3) What each Ci means and its truth value
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given initial event2 but event1 cannot occur after event2, C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is equivalent to event2 -> (event2 and event1), i.e. event2 -> event1. Since event2 actually happens but event1 does not, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1 (""event2 and event1""), so false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is C2 -> C3. An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true (C2 is false so C4 holds).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is a logical truth in the current state (true), and its truth does not depend on new events; so C5 is true.
- C6: ""event1 happens or C5 holds."" Since C5 is true, C6 is true.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the same as C2, so C7 is false.
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" That is true AND false, hence false.

4) How they relate
- The key is that event2 happened initially and prevents event1 from ever happening afterward. That makes any implication that requires event1 given event2 fail (C2 and C7 fail). Those failures make C3 and C1 false, but they do make the implication C4 true (false antecedent). C4 being true in the next state makes C5 true, which makes C6 true; but because C7 is false, the conjunction C8 is false.

Therefore C8 = False.

Assumption about temporal operators
- I assume ""eventually"" (F) means ""true now or at some future time"" and ""always"" (G) means ""true now and at all future times."" This is the standard interpretation in linear-time temporal logic. If you meant a different semantics, tell me and I will adapt.

1) What events are involved and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the initial moment.
- Also given: after event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. So both event1 and event2 are absorbing/terminal: once either has happened, the system stays in that situation and no further events occur.
- Because event2 happened initially, the system is in the terminal state corresponding to event2 and nothing will change from now on.

2) Transition rules between events
- There are no transitions out of the event1 or event2 states (they are terminal).
- Since we start in the event2 state, there are no future event occurrences at all; all truth values that depend only on event2’s occurrence stay constant.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition and their evaluation
I list each Ci, give its plain meaning, and evaluate it under the above assumptions.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
  - Meaning: F(event2).
  - Evaluation: True — event2 already happened now, so ""eventually"" holds.

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
  - Meaning: event2 (now) ∨ C1.
  - Evaluation: True — C1 is true (and event2 also holds now).

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds.""
  - Meaning: F(C2).
  - Evaluation: True — C2 holds now, so it holds eventually.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold.""
  - Meaning: ¬C3.
  - Evaluation: False — C3 is true, so its negation is false.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold.""
  - Meaning: ¬C4.
  - Evaluation: True — since C4 is false, ¬C4 is true.

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds.""
  - Meaning: F(C5).
  - Evaluation: True — C5 holds now, so it holds eventually.

- C7: ""C6 always holds.""
  - Meaning: G(C6).
  - Evaluation: True — because the system is stuck in the event2 terminal state, C6 holds now and will hold at every future instant (nothing changes), so it is always true.

- C8: ""C7 eventually holds.""
  - Meaning: F(C7).
  - Evaluation: True — C7 holds now, so it holds eventually.

- C9: ""C8 does not hold.""
  - Meaning: ¬C8.
  - Evaluation: False — C8 is true, so its negation is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- Starting from C1 being true (because event2 already happened), each subsequent Ci that references earlier truths also becomes true, except for explicit negations that flip truth when they reference a true statement (e.g., C4).
- Final result: C9 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 holds now, so C1 (F event2) is true, this makes C2 true, hence C3 true, so C4 false, C5 true, C6 true (holds now and always), C7 true, C8 true, and therefore C9 (¬C8) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (it happened initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 has occurred, no further events may occur).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (i.e., if event2 occurred, it would also block any further events).
- Because event1 already happened initially and Rule A blocks any further events, event2 cannot occur at any time in this model.

Step 3 — meaning of each Ci and its truth value
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 occurred and blocks further events, event2 indeed does not happen. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial state, C1 is true now and remains true at all times — so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is False.
- C4: same as C3 (duplicate): False.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are False, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is already false now, so it cannot be true always; C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is False.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- The key facts are that event1 happened initially and that event1 prevents any subsequent events. That makes C1 and thus C2 true, which makes C3 and C4 false, which makes C5 false, and therefore C6 and C7 false.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the initial state.
- Additional rules: after event2, no other events can happen; after event1, no other events can happen. (Both events are terminal: once either has happened, the trace has no further events.)

2) Transition rules between events
- If event2 occurs, there is no successor state with further events (no event1 can occur afterwards).
- If event1 occurs, likewise no successor events exist.
- In particular, because event2 already happened initially, event1 cannot happen at any later point in the trace.

(Implicit temporal-semantic assumption used below: the usual “next” operator is false at a final state / there is no successor state after a terminal event.)

3) Meaning and truth of each Ci
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” True — event2 has already happened at the initial state, so the eventuality is satisfied immediately.
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” True — C1 is true and event2 does in fact occur (already did).
- C3: same as C2 (“C1 holds and event2 happens”). True.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” True — C3 holds now, so it holds eventually.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” False — we just found C4 is true, so C5 is false.
- C6: “If C2 holds, then C5 holds” (C2 → C5). Since C2 is true and C5 is false, the implication is false. So C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” There is no next state after the initial event2 (terminal), so under the standard semantics the Next(C6) is false. Hence C7 is false.
  (If one used a different model with an explicit stuttering successor where truth values persist, conclusions might differ — but with the given “no other events can happen” and standard next semantics, Next is false.)
- C8: “C7 holds and event1 happens.” C7 is false, and event1 cannot happen after event2, so the conjunction is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- The chain collapses because C5 is false, making C6 false; there is no next state to make C7 true; and event1 is impossible after event2. Therefore C8 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 already occurred and both events are terminal, so C1–C4 are true but C5 is false, making C6 false. There is no successor state, so Next(C6) (C7) is false, and event1 cannot occur after event2; therefore C7 ∧ event1 (C8) is false."

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no further events can occur, so event1 cannot occur.
- From event2 happening, C1 (event2 always happens) follows, so C2 and C3 hold, hence C4 holds.
- C4 holding implies C5 eventually holds, and with no further events this means C6 (C5 always holds) holds.
- C7 says ""if C6 holds then event1 happens."" Since C6 does hold, C7 would require event1 to happen — but event1 cannot happen after event2.
- Therefore C7 is false, so C8 (""C7 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so E1 = true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward. So event2 does not happen (E2 = false).
- (Similarly: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant once we know event2 did not occur.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
- C1, C2, C3, C4 each assert (event1 happens AND event2 happens) = E1 ∧ E2. Since E1 = true and E2 = false, each of C1..C4 is false.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4. Both C3 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.
- C6 = (if event1 happens then C5). Since E1 is true but C5 is false, the implication E1 → C5 is false (true antecedent, false consequent).
- C7 = C2 ∨ C6. Both C2 and C6 are false, so C7 is false.
- C8 = (if C1 holds then C7 holds). C1 is false, so the implication C1 → C7 is vacuously true (false antecedent → anything = true). Thus C8 is true.
- C9 = ""C8 does not hold"" = ¬C8. Since C8 is true, C9 is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- The initial truth of event1 and the rule that no events follow imply event2 is false, which makes all conjunctions asserting both events false. Propagating those truth values through the implications gives C8 true and therefore C9 false.

Therefore C9 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already happened and prevents event2, so E2 = false. That makes C1–C4 false, hence C5 false, C6 false, C7 false, C8 vacuously true, so C9 = ¬C8 is false."

Short answer: C9 is False (at the initial state).

Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event2 happens.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: if event1 holds at time t, then event2 holds at time t+1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: if event2 holds at time t, then event1 holds at time t+1.
- From the initial event2 at time 0 these rules make the system alternate: time 0: event2, time 1: event1, time 2: event2, time 3: event1, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting them as state propositions evaluated at the initial time unless a ""next"" is explicit)
- C1: event2 ∧ event2 — equivalent to event2 (at the current state).
- C2: C1 → event2.
- C3: event2 → C2.
- C4: event2 ∧ event2 (same as C1).
- C5: C3 ∨ C4.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (so C5 evaluated at time 1).
- C7: ¬C6 (C6 does not hold at the current state).
- C8: ¬C7.
- C9: ¬C8.

4) How these conditions relate and their truth values (evaluate at time 0)
- Time 0: event2 is true.
  - C1 = event2 ∧ event2 = true.
  - C2 = (C1 → event2). Since C1 is true and event2 is true, C2 = true.
  - C3 = (event2 → C2). event2 is true and C2 is true, so C3 = true.
  - C4 = same as C1 = true.
  - C5 = C3 ∨ C4 = true ∨ true = true.
- C6 asserts C5 at time 1. Evaluate C5 at time 1:
  - Time 1: by the rules, event1 is true and event2 is false.
  - C1 at time1 = event2 ∧ event2 = false.
  - C2 at time1 = (C1 → event2) = (false → anything) = true.
  - C3 at time1 = (event2 → C2) = (false → anything) = true.
  - C4 at time1 = false.
  - C5 at time1 = true ∨ false = true.
  - Therefore C6 (C5 at time1) is true when evaluated at time0.
- C7 = ¬C6 = not true = false (at time0).
- C8 = ¬C7 = not false = true (at time0).
- C9 = ¬C8 = not true = false (at time0).

Conclusion: C9 is False (given the initial state where event2 holds and the two transition rules).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C5 holds at time 0 and at time 1, so C6 is true, hence C7 = ¬C6 is false, C8 = ¬C7 is true, and C9 = ¬C8 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (in the initial state).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, no other events can occur (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can occur (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 already happened initially and it is terminal, no further events (in particular, event1) can occur at or after the initial state.

Step 3 — meaning and truth of each sub-condition
I read each Ci as a plain propositional/temporal claim about what holds at/after the initial state.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""  
  This is the tautology p → p. It is always true (holds in every state).

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""  
  Since C1 is true unconditionally, C2 (event1 → C1) is also true in every state.

- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds.""  
  This requires event1 to happen. But event1 cannot happen (event2 already happened and forbids any further events). So C3 is false.

- C4: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds.""  
  Same as C3, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""  
  Because C4 never holds (event1 never happens), ""eventually C4"" is false.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state.""  
  Since C5 is false, C6 is false.

- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds.""  
  C3 is false and C6 is false, so their conjunction C7 is false.

Step 4 — how conditions relate and final answer
- C1 and C2 are tautologically true, but they do not create new occurrences of event1.
- Any Ci that requires event1 (C3, C4) is false because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- The temporal claims depending on C4 (C5, C6) are therefore false.
- C7 = C3 ∧ C6, so C7 is false.

Final answer: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 already happened and is terminal so event1 can never occur; hence C3 (requires event1) is false and C6 (depends on C4 which requires event1) is false, so C7 = C3 ∧ C6 is false."

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 happened.
- From the context we get the trace: event2 occurs, then (must) event1 occurs, and after event1 no further events occur. So the execution is: at some time t0 event2, at t1 event1, and then termination (no more events).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- There is no branching or alternative: the only allowed sequence consistent with the context is event2 → event1 → end.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
Interpreting “holds”, “always”, and “eventually” in the usual temporal-sense:
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event1 happens.” This is a logical tautology (P → P). It is true whenever checked.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” There is some time in the future at which C1 is true.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” The negation of C2.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” C3 is true at all times.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” There is some time in the future at which C4 is true.
- C6: “C1 eventually holds.” Same as C2.
- C7: “C5 holds and C6 holds.” Conjunction of C5 and C6.
- C8: “C7 eventually holds.” There is some future time at which C7 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and truth values on the given trace
Evaluate each Ci on the described trace:

- C1: True. It is a tautology (if P then P), so it holds immediately and at all times.
- C2: True. Since C1 already holds (immediately), it is certainly true that C1 holds at some time in the future (or now).
- C3: False. It asserts “C2 does not hold”, but C2 is true.
- C4: False. It asserts C3 is true always, but C3 is false (so it cannot be always true).
- C5: False. It asserts “C4 eventually holds”; C4 never holds, so C5 is false.
- C6: True. Same as C2; C1 does eventually hold.
- C7: False. It requires both C5 and C6; C5 is false, so the conjunction is false.
- C8: False. It asserts “C7 eventually holds”. Since C7 never holds on the trace, C8 is false.

Conclusion
C8 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 holds (tautology), so C2 and C6 hold; but C3 (¬C2) is false, so C4 and C5 are false, making C7 false at all times; hence C7 never eventually holds, so C8 is false."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen afterwards (i.e., event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- Whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterwards (i.e., event2 ⇒ eventually event1).

Given the initial event2, these rules force at least one occurrence of event1 (and thereafter event2, etc.), so both events occur (and in fact will alternate).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 already happened initially (and will happen again).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (a conjunction with a false conjunct is false), even though event1 does happen.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is never true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same as C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This implication is true: C3 is false, and a false antecedent makes the implication true (material implication).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" C6 is false, but event1 does happen (from the rule ""after event2 → event1"" together with initial event2). So the disjunction is true.

4) How they relate & final verdict
- C1 false ⇒ C2 false ⇒ C3 and C4 false.
- C3 false ⇒ C5 is true ⇒ C6 false.
- Event1 does happen (forced by the transitions and initial event2), so C7 = (event1 happens) ∨ (false) = True.

Therefore C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: initial event2 and the rules (event2 ⇒ eventually event1) ensure event1 does happen, so the disjunction ""event1 happens or C6 holds"" is true."

- C1(s) = event1(s). C2(s) = event1(s+1). C3(s) = event1(s) ∧ event1(s+1) — impossible under alternation, so C3 is always false.
- Therefore C4 = ¬C3 is always true, so C5 (C4 next) is always true, and C6 (always C5) is true.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur sometime after the initial state.
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is terminal; the system stops after event2.

So the actual execution is: event1 initially, then event2, then nothing else.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (always true).
- C2: same as C1, also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 (and C2) are true, C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" This requires C5 true, but C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" This asks whether C6 will be true at some point in the future.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- C6 is false now and nothing in the system makes C5 become true later (no further events after event2), so C6 will never become true.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Additional facts: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So each event is terminal (no further events can occur afterward).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs, the system reaches a state with no further events.
- If event2 occurs, the system reaches a state with no further events.
- Since event1 happened initially, the system has reached a terminal point where no further events occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" At the initial state this is true (event1 happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" After event1 there are no further events, so in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds. (If there is no successor state, the usual semantics of a next operator makes X p false.) Thus C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 (C1 in the next state) → false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (globally). Since C3 is false now, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" → false (C4 is false).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" → false.
- C7: ""If C2 holds, then C6 holds."" This is an implication. Because C2 is false, the implication is vacuously true (false ⇒ anything is true). So C7 is true.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold."" Since C7 holds, C8 is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- The chain of next/always operators makes C2–C6 all false given the terminal nature after event1. The implication C7 is true only because its antecedent C2 is false (vacuous truth). Therefore the statement ""C7 does not hold"" (C8) is false.

Conclusion: C8 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.
- Also given: “After event1, no other events can happen.” and “After event2, no other events can happen.”
  From these we conclude that because event1 already happened, no other event can happen afterward — in particular event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

So concrete truth values:
- event1 = True
- event2 = False

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Both rules “After event1, no other events can happen” and “After event2, no other events can happen” mean whichever of event1 or event2 happens first prevents any other event from happening later. Since event1 already happened, event2 cannot happen.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Given event1 = True, C1 is False.
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens.” That is (not event1) OR event2. Since C1 is False and event2 is False, C2 is False.
- C3: “If event2 happens, then C2 holds.” This is the implication (event2 → C2). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so since event2 = False, C3 is True (vacuously).
- C4: same as C2 (C1 or event2). So C4 is False.
- C5: “C3 holds or C4 holds.” C3 is True, C4 is False, so C5 is True.
- C6: same as C2/C4 (C1 or event2). So C6 is False.
- C7: “C5 holds and C6 holds.” That is True AND False = False.

Step 4 — how conditions relate and final answer
- C2, C4 and C6 are the same condition (C1 or event2) and are all False.
- C3 is true because the implication has a false antecedent.
- C5 is true because it includes C3.
- C7 requires both C5 and C6; because C6 is False, C7 is False.

Final answer: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 = True and event2 = False, so C6 (C1 or event2) is False, making C7 (C5 and C6) False."

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event1 has happened.
- Additional constraint: after event1, no other events can ever happen. So once we are in (or after) a state where event1 occurred, no future state can have event2 (or any other event).

2) Transition rules (interpretation)
- “After event2, event1 must happen” means: if event2 occurs at some state then at some (the next or at least a later) state event1 will occur. (We only need the weaker reading that any occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1.)
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means: once event1 has happened, no further occurrences of event1 or event2 occur in any future state.
- Combined with the initial condition (event1 already happened initially), there are no future occurrences of event2 at any time.

3) What each Ci means (informal)
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” (There exists some future state where event2 occurs.)
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” (At some future state, C1 is true — i.e., at some future point it becomes true that event2 will eventually happen.)
- C3: same as C1 (given by the hypothesis).
- C4: “C2 holds and C3 holds.” (Both C2 and C3 true.)
- C5: “If event2 happens, then C4 holds.” (Whenever event2 occurs, C4 is true — a conditional.)
- C6: “C5 does not hold.” (Negation of the previous conditional.)
- C7: “C6 eventually holds.” (At some future state C6 is true.)
- C8: “C7 eventually holds.” (At some future state C7 is true.)
- C9: “C8 holds in the next state.” (In the immediate next state, C8 is true.)

4) How they relate and truth evaluation under the given scenario
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 never happens at any future state. Therefore:
  - C1 (“event2 eventually happens”) is false.
  - C3 is the same as C1, so false.
  - C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is also false: C1 will never become true in the future, so there is no future state where C1 holds.
  - C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is false (both conjuncts false).
- C5 is an implication: “If event2 happens, then C4 holds.” Since event2 never happens, the antecedent is always false, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C5 holds.
- C6 = “C5 does not hold” is false (because C5 does hold).
- C7 = “C6 eventually holds” is false (C6 is false now and will never become true).
- C8 = “C7 eventually holds” is false (same reasoning).
- C9 = “C8 holds in the next state” is false (C8 is never true, so certainly not true in the next state).

Therefore C9 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already occurred and thereafter no events can occur, so event2 never happens. That makes C1–C4 false; C5 is vacuously true, so C6 is false; hence C7, C8 and therefore C9 are all false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen thereafter).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (not directly used here because event2 does not occur).

Given event1 happened initially and Rule A, event2 does not occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 happened and Rule A forbids any further events.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is a material implication. Because event2 does not happen, the implication is vacuously True.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" (same as C3) True for the same reason.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" C4 is True, event2 is False, so the disjunction is True.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Negation of C5, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C3 holds and C6 holds."" C3 is True but C6 is False, so the conjunction is False.

4) How do these conditions relate and final result?
- The chain: C1 true → C2 false → C3 and C4 true (vacuous) → C5 true → C6 false → C7 (true AND false) = False.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

- C1 = (event1 → event2). At s0 this is false (event1 true, event2 false). At any later state si (i≥1) it is true vacuously (event1 is false there).
- C2 = X(C1) holds at s0 because C1 is true in s1. Hence C2 is true at s0.
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2 is then true at s0 (C2 true).
- C4 = X(C3) is true at s0 because C3 holds in s1 (C2 remains true there).
- C5 = event1 ∧ C4 is true at s0 (event1 true and C4 true).
- C6 = X(C1) is the same as C2, so also true at s0.
- C7 = C5 ∨ C6 is true at s0 (in fact true in all later states as well).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition from the context: event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- Also from the context: after event1, event2 must happen — so event2 happens (event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen — no other events are relevant here.

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- event1 occurs first.
- event2 must occur after event1.
- event2 is terminal (no further events after it).

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" So C1 is the negation of event1.
- C2: same as C1 (also ""Event1 does not happen"").
- C3: C1 and C2, i.e., both say event1 does not happen. So C3 is equivalent to ""event1 does not happen.""
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally C4 = (C3 → event1).
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" So C5 = C4 ∨ event2.
- C6: C1 and C2 again (same as C3).
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" Formally C7 = (C5 → C6).

Step 4 — relations and truth evaluation
- From Step 1 we have event1 = True and event2 = True.
- Then C1 = (not event1) = False. C2 = False.
- C3 = C1 ∧ C2 = False.
- C4 = (C3 → event1). A material implication with a false antecedent is True, so C4 = True.
- C5 = C4 ∨ event2 = True ∨ True = True.
- C6 = C1 ∧ C2 = False (same as C3).
- C7 = (C5 → C6) = (True → False) = False.

Conclusion
- C7 is False.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen in this scenario.
- (The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is present but irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminating: if either happens, no further events can occur.
- Because event1 has already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) Meaning and truth of each Ci (standard material implication / propositional logic)
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is p → p, a tautology, so C1 is True.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" C2 is True while C4 is False, so the implication is False.
- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds."" C1 is True and C5 is False, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C6 holds."" This is an implication with antecedent (event2) that does not occur. In material implication that makes C7 vacuously True (false antecedent → implication is True).
- C8: ""C7 always holds."" Since C7 is True, C8 is True.
- C9: ""C8 holds and event2 happens."" C8 is True but event2 does not happen (False), so the conjunction is False.

4) How they relate / overall picture
- C1–C3 are trivially true tautologies.
- That makes C4 false, which makes C5 false, which makes C6 false.
- C7 is true only vacuously because event2 does not occur; C8 is true because C7 is true.
- But C9 requires event2 to happen; since event2 cannot happen (event1 happened first and forbids further events), C9 is False.

Conclusion: C9 is False.

Reasoning (compact):

- Let e1 and e2 denote “event1 happens” and “event2 happens” at a state.
- C1, C2, C3 are all equivalent to (e1 ∨ e2) (C3 = e1 ∨ C2 = e1 ∨ (e1 ∨ e2) = e1 ∨ e2).
- Timeline from the context:
  - s0: e1 true (initial).
  - s1: e2 true (must follow e1).
  - s2 onward: no events (e1 = e2 = false).
- Evaluate C5 = G(X C3): requires that at every state the next state satisfies (e1 ∨ e2).
  - At s1, the next state s2 has no events, so (e1 ∨ e2) is false at s2. Hence C5 is false (not always).
- C6 = C1 ∧ C5 is therefore false at s0 (C1 true but C5 false). So C7 = ¬C6 is true (at s0 and at s1).
- C8 = X C7 is true at s0 because C7 is true at s1. Thus C8 already holds at s0.
- C9 = F C8 (eventually C8) is therefore True (indeed C8 holds immediately).

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (state S0): event2 happened.
- Transition rule: after event2 happens, no other events can happen in any future state. (Also: after event1, no other events can happen — same kind of blocking.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Once event2 has occurred (as it does at S0), both event1 and event2 are false in every later state (S1, S2, ...). Similarly, if event1 were to occur at some state, no events would occur after that state. So after S0, no events occur at S1 or later.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (Evaluate at the initial state S0, unless otherwise stated)
- C1: ""event2 or event1"" — at S0 this is True (event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this asks whether (event2 or event1) is true in S1. It is False because no events occur in S1.
- C3: same as C2 (again ""C1 holds in the next state"") — False.
- C4: ""event2 or event1"" at the current state — same as C1, True at S0.
- C5: ""C3 and C4"" — False ∧ True = False.
- C6: ""C2 and C5"" — False ∧ False = False.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — does C6 hold at S1? Evaluate C6 at S1: C2 (at S1) asks if C1 holds at S2 — false; C5 (at S1) is false; so C6 at S1 is False. Therefore C7 (that C6 holds in the next state) is False at S0.
- C8: ""C7 does not hold"" — since C7 is False, C8 is True.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because the initial event2 blocks any events in the future, any condition that requires event1 or event2 in a next state (C2/C3/C7 via C6/C5) fails. That makes C7 false, and thus C8 (the negation of C7) true.

Conclusion: C8 is True.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at state 0) event1 happened.
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs at some state, then event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Once event1 has happened, no events occur in any later state.)

2) Transition rules (informal temporal meaning)
- ""Next state"" = the immediate successor state.
- Rule B implies: from the state immediately after event1 onward, neither event1 nor event2 can occur in any later state.
- Therefore, because event1 already occurred initially, no event2 can ever occur in any future state.

3) What the Ci mean (at the initial state unless otherwise noted)
- C1: event2 happens in the next state (i.e., event2 at time 1).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., at time 1, event2 happens at time 2).
- C3: (same as C2 — redundant) C1 holds in the next state.
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold (conjunction of two identical claims → equivalent to C2).
- C5: C4 holds and event2 happens (so event2 happens now and the future-next-next sequence described by C4 holds).
- C6: C5 eventually holds (there is some future state where C5 is true).
- C7: C6 always holds (in every state, C6 is true).
- C8: C7 holds in the next state (i.e., at time 1, C7 is true).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 happened initially and Rule B forbids any events after event1, event2 cannot occur in any future state. So any condition that requires event2 to hold at some future state is impossible.
- In particular, C1 is false at the initial state (event2 does not occur at time 1). Consequently C2, C3, C4, and C5 are all false whenever they require event2 anywhere.
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false in every state because C5 can never become true.
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") therefore is false (it requires C6 to be true in every state, but C6 is false).
- Finally, C8 claims C7 is true in the next state. Since C7 is false, C8 is false.

Therefore C8 is False.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning (with a few small, explicit assumptions about the meaning of ""always""):

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen next.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen next.
- Hence the sequence of events from t0 is: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … (they alternate forever).

(Assumption: ""after"" means the next step; the rules force alternation.)

3) What each sub-condition means (interpreting ""always happens"" as “happens at every time step”)
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Interpreted as “at every time step event1 occurs.” Under the alternating sequence, that is false (there are steps when event2 occurs instead).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: “C1 always holds.” Same as C2, false.
- C4: “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” This implication is vacuously true because C2 is false.
- C5: “C1 always holds.” Same as C1, false.
- C6: “If C4 holds, then C5 holds.” Antecedent C4 is true, consequent C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 holds or event2 happens.” This is a disjunction.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- We found C6 is false but event2 does happen (at t1, and repeatedly thereafter). So the disjunction C6 ∨ event2 is true. Therefore C7 is True.

Note on ambiguity: if one instead reads “always happens” as “occurs infinitely often,” then C1 would be true under the alternation and every Ci would evaluate differently (in that reading all Ci would come out true and C7 still true). The conclusion that C7 is True is robust because event2 does occur under the given rules.

Short answer: C8 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur.
These rules force alternation: starting from event2, event1 will happen next, then event2, then event1, … — so both events occur repeatedly (event2 occurs again and again).

3) What each Ci means and its truth value under the above dynamics?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Under the alternation rule (and given the initial event2), event2 occurs repeatedly/invariably in the execution. Interpreting ""always happens"" as “it will (continually) occur” or “occurs infinitely often,” C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 is True, and the system guarantees event1 does happen (because after event2 comes event1), so the conditional C4 is True.
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, so False.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" C4 is True, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C8: ""C6 holds and C7 holds."" Both C6 and C7 are True, so C8 is True.

4) How the conditions relate
- C2 and C5 are just negations of C1, so once you establish C1 is true they are both false.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 becomes true, which (via C4) ensures event1 — consistent with the transition rules.
- C6 is satisfied because C4 is true; C7 repeats C1; therefore C8 (C6 and C7) is true.

Note/caveat: This conclusion assumes ""always happens"" is interpreted in the intended procedural/temporal way (event2 will recur inevitably under the rules). If instead ""always happens"" were interpreted to mean ""holds continuously at every instant (even during event1 occurrences),"" then that stronger reading would be false, and some labels would change. Under the usual reading for such event-transition problems, C8 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From the alternation rules (starting with event2), event2 recurs, so C1 and C7 hold. Thus C2 and C5 (negations of C1) are false, making C3 true. C4 (""if C3 then event1"") holds because event1 does occur, so C6 (C4 or C5) is true. Therefore C8 (C6 and C7) is true."

Short answer: C6 is True (under the usual interpretation that ""eventX happens"" means it occurs at a particular state/time).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Since event1 already happened initially, no further events occur in any later state.

3) What each condition means (reading ""holds in the next state"" in the usual way of a next-step temporal operator):
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" (true at a state if one of those events occurs at that same state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1 is true one step later).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1 is true two steps later).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"".
- C5: same as C4 (duplicate).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" (both negations of C3).

4) How they relate and evaluation over time
Make a short timeline of states:
- State 0 (initial): event1 happens.
- State 1 (next): no events happen.
- State 2 (next after that): no events happen.
(And so on — no events ever after state 0.)

Evaluate:
- C1 at state0: True (event1 happens at state0).
- C1 at state1: False (no events at state1).
- Therefore C2 at state0 (C1 at state1): False.
- C2 at state1 (C1 at state2): False, so C3 at state0 (C2 at state1): False.
- C3 is false, so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True. C5 is the same, True.
- C6 = C4 and C5 = True and True = True.

So C6 is True.

Note on alternative semantics: If instead ""event1 happens"" were treated as a persistent fact that remains true in all later states (e.g., ""event1 has happened at some time in the past""), then C1 would be true in every state, making C2 and C3 true and C4/C5 false, so C6 would be false. The conclusion above assumes the standard instantaneous-event interpretation.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

(Under the standard instantaneous-event reading: event1 occurs only at the initial state, so C3 is false, hence C4 and C5 are true and C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is true. Under a persistent/once-occurred semantics the answer would be False.)"

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and the initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is true at the start).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Thus the actual timeline is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What each sub-condition means (and its truth value)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False, because event1 does happen.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — Means C1 is false. Since C1 is false, C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" — Interpreting ""always holds"" as a permanent/global truth: C2 is true and remains true (it is a fact that event1 did happen), so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — False, because C3 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" — True, because C4 is false.
- C6: ""C2 always holds."" — Same as C3, so True.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" — Conjunction of two Trues, so True.

4) How the conditions relate
- The transition rules force event1 to occur, which makes C1 false and C2 true.
- Once C2 is true as a permanent fact, ""C2 always holds"" (C3/C6) is true.
- That makes C4 false and C5 true.
- Therefore both C5 and C6 are true, so their conjunction C7 is True.

Note: this depends on reading ""always holds"" as a permanent/global truth about the system (i.e., once event1 has happened, statements about it do not later flip). Under that standard reading, C7 is True.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the start).

(Assumption made explicit: events are point occurrences. ""Initially, event2 happened"" means event2 has occurred, and ""after X"" statements govern what may occur later. This matches the usual reading of these temporal rules.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs at some time, then at a later time event2 occurs).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: once event2 has happened, no further events — including event1 — can occur).

Because event2 happens initially and event2 is terminal, no other events can ever occur after the start. In particular, event1 does not occur at any time.

3) Meaning and truth of each sub-condition
Interpret each Ci in plain terms and evaluate under the model above:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this as ""event2 does happen (is true in the system)"" — True, because event2 happened initially.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" That is, C1 ⇒ event1. C1 holds but event1 does not occur (see step 2), so C2 is False.
- C3: Same as C2. So C3 is False.
- C4: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is False, this implication is vacuously True.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is True, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""C6 holds and event1 happens."" C6 holds but event1 does not, so C7 is False.
- C8: ""C2 holds or C7 holds."" Both C2 and C7 are False, so C8 is False.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- The key driver is that event2 happened initially and is terminal, which prevents event1 from ever occurring.
- That makes any claim that would require event1 (e.g., the consequents of C2/C3/C7) false.
- Therefore C8 (C2 or C7) is False. 

If you intended a different formal reading of ""always happens"" (for example, meaning ""at every time point"" rather than ""it occurs somewhere""), tell me and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 happens initially and is terminal, so event1 never occurs. Therefore:
- C1 and C4 (event2 happens) are true.
- C2 and C3 (which require event1 when C1 holds) are false.
- C5 is vacuously true (since C3 is false), so C6 is true.
- C7 (C6 and event1) is false because event1 never occurs.
- C8 = C2 or C7 is False or False = False.

If you meant ""always happens"" in a different formal sense (e.g., ""at every time""), say so and I will re-evaluate."

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen. So any state reached after a state where event2 occurred admits no further events.
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs then at some next step event2 occurs).

Given event2 has already occurred in S0, the rule “after event2 no other events can happen” means there are no events in the next state (call it S1). In particular, event1 cannot occur in S1.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
Evaluate each Ci relative to the scenario (S0 and S1):

- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.”  
  Since after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not happen in S1. So C1 = False.

- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.”  
  event2 did happen (in S0). That would require C1 to hold, but C1 is False. So C2 = False.

- C3: “C2 always holds.”  
  Because C2 is already false (at least in S0), it cannot be true that C2 always holds. So C3 = False.

- C4: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.”  
  This is the same claim as C2, so C4 = False.

- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.”  
  This is an implication with antecedent C3 which is False. A material implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 = True (vacuously true).

- C6: “C5 does not hold.”  
  C5 does hold (it is True), so C6 = False.

- C7: “Event2 happens and C6 holds.”  
  Event2 did happen (True) but C6 is False, so the conjunction is False. C7 = False.

- C8: “C7 always holds.”  
  C7 is already false, so it cannot be always true. Therefore C8 = False.

4) How the conditions relate (summary)
- There is an inconsistency between the background rules and C2/C4: the background says no events can follow event2, but C2/C4 assert that event1 would follow event2; that makes C2/C4 false in this model.
- Because C3 (that C2 always holds) is false, C5 (the implication from C3 to C4) becomes vacuously true. That makes C6 false, which in turn makes any conjunction that includes C6 false (so C7 false), and therefore C8 (that C7 always holds) false.

Final answer: C8 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).
- Because event1 already happened initially and it is terminal, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.

Step 3 — meaning and truth value of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this as ""event2 holds at all times / in every reachable state."" Since event2 never occurs, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That says at some future point C1 becomes true. Because C1 is never true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 eventually holds."" (same as C2) false.
- C5: ""C1 eventually holds."" (same again) false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C3 holds or C6 holds."" Both C3 and C6 are false, so C7 is false.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate
- C2, C4, C5 assert that C1 will become true at some point (they are duplicates here).
- C3 asserts that C2 is always true.
- C6 is conjunction of C4 and C5 (both duplicates).
- C7 is the disjunction of C3 and C6.
- Since the initial terminal event1 prevents event2 ever occurring, C1 and all conditions depending on C1 are false, so C7 is false.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does happen).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the only events that occur are event1 then event2, and then the sequence ends).

Therefore, in the actual scenario: event1 = True, event2 = True.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value)?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event1 did happen, C1 is False.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply ¬C1. Since C1 is False, C2 is True.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1) so C3 is False.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is the implication C2 → C3. With C2 = True and C3 = False, the implication is False.
- C5: same statement as C4, so C5 is also False.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" This is C4 ∨ C5. With both C4 and C5 False, C6 is False.

4) How do these conditions relate?
- C3 repeats C1. C4 and C5 repeat the same implication. Because the implication is from a true antecedent (C2) to a false consequent (C3), the implication is false, making both C4 and C5 false. Their disjunction C6 is therefore false.

Conclusion: C6 = False.

Short answer: C9 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens the next state has event1.
- After event1 happens the next state has event2.
So the system alternates: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ….

3) Meaning of each Ci (interpreting ""always"" = globally, ""next"" = next-state)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is P → P, a tautology — true in every state.
- C2: same as C1, also true in every state.
- C3: ""event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is always true, C3 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Because C3 is true everywhere, C4 simplifies to just event2 — true exactly in states where event2 holds (s0, s2, …).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" ≡ not(event2) — true exactly in states with event1 (s1, s3, …).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" ≡ not(not(event2)) ≡ event2 — same truth pattern as C4.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" ≡ globally(event2). That claims event2 holds in every state. This is false because the system alternates and there are states (s1, s3, …) where event1 (not event2) holds.
- C8: ""C1 holds and C7 holds."" C1 is true but C7 is false, so C8 is false in every state.
- C9: ""C8 holds in the next state"" (next C8). To evaluate C9 at any state, look at the next state: since C8 is false in every state, C8 is false in the next state, so C9 is false.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- The key failure is C7: it requires event2 in all states, which contradicts the alternating behavior. Because C7 is false, any condition depending on it (C8, and thus C9) is false.
- Therefore C9 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur later.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur later.
Together these force alternating occurrences (event1 → event2 → event1 → ...), so event1 keeps occurring indefinitely.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1), i.e. F(F event1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (¬C2).
- C4: ""C1 eventually holds"" (same as C2).
- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (same as C1).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" (C4 ∧ C5).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" (¬C6).
- C8: ""C3 holds or C7 holds"" (C3 ∨ C7).

(Notes: In temporal logic F is idempotent: F(F p) ≡ F p.)

4) How they relate and value assignment
- Because event1 holds initially (and the transition rules ensure it recurs), C1 is true.
- By idempotence (or by the same reasoning), C2 and C4 are also true.
- C5 is the same as C1, so true.
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is true ∧ true = true.
- C3 = ¬C2 = false.
- C7 = ¬C6 = false.
- C8 = C3 ∨ C7 = false ∨ false = false.

Therefore C8 is False.

Reasoning (brief):
1. Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 can never occur.
2. C1 and C2 (""event2 eventually happens"") are therefore False.
3. C3 (C2 or event1) is True because event1 already happened.
4. C4 (C3 does not hold) is False, and since nothing can change, C4 never becomes true.
5. C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is False; C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is False.
6. C7 (C6 does not hold) is True.
7. C8 (C1 and C7) is False (C1 is false).
8. C9 (""C8 always holds"") is False because C8 is false.

Thus C9 is False."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it has already occurred at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — nothing can occur after it).

Since event1 already happened initially and it is terminal, no events can occur after that initial moment (in particular, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true; therefore C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as holding at all relevant times/necessarily: because C1 is a tautology (true independent of time), C2 is always true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This asserts ¬C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C3 does not hold."" Same as C4, so C5 is also false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" This is C4 ∨ C5. Both C4 and C5 are false, so the disjunction is false.

4) Relations among the conditions
- C1 being a tautology makes C2 true regardless of event2.
- That makes C3 true (if “always” is taken in the natural way), which makes C4 and C5 (negations of C3) false.
- C6, as the disjunction of two false statements, is false.

Conclusion: C6 is False.

Short answer: C8 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- Constraint A: After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no future state can contain any event).
- Constraint B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, then at some later point event1 must occur).

Because event1 has already happened initially and Constraint A forbids any subsequent events, event2 can never occur in any future state.

2) Transition rules between events
- From the initial state (where event1 has happened) no transitions can produce any event later. So event2 is impossible at all times.
- Constraint B would require event1 after event2, but since event2 cannot occur and event1 cannot occur again after the initial event (Constraint A blocks any further events), the only consistent outcome is that event2 never happens.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state."" — asserts that in the immediate next state event2 occurs.
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" — at some future point (possibly now or later) there is a state in which C2 is true (i.e., from that state the next state has event2).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" — in the immediate next state, C3 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds.""
- C6: ""C2 eventually holds."" — same as C3 (duplicate).
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds.""
- C8: ""C7 holds in the next state."" — in the immediate next state, C7 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and their truth values
Given that event2 can never occur:

- C1: False (next state does not have event2).
- C2: False (same as C1).
- C3: False (there is never a state where C2 is true because event2 never occurs).
- C4: False (next state does not make C3 true).
- C5: False (C1 or C4 both false).
- C6: False (same as C3).
- C7: False (C5 or C6 both false).
- C8: False (in the next state, C7 is false).

Therefore C8 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 already occurred and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" prevents any future event2. All conditions C1–C7 depend on event2 occurring (directly or eventually), so they are false; therefore C8 (that C7 holds in the next state) is also false."
