- After event1, no other events can happen, meaning from state S1 onwards, no events (including event1 or event2) can occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen, but since event1 occurred initially, event2 cannot happen due to the condition after event1.

Now, evaluating the hypotheses:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state (S1). Since no events can happen after event1, C1 is false.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds. Since event2 cannot happen and C1 is false, C2 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen.

C1 states that if event2 happens, then event1 happens. Since event1 occurred initially, C1 is always true.

C2 states that C1 eventually holds. Since C1 is always true, C2 holds immediately and always.

C3 states that C2 holds or event1 happens. Since C2 holds, C3 is true.

C4 states that C3 does not hold. However, since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Therefore, C4 is False.

Therefore, the statement ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (C1 and C3) is true. C2 claims that C1 does not hold, which is false because C1 is true. C4 states that if C2 holds, then C3 holds.
