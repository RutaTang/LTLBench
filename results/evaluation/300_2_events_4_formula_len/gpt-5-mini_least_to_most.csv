Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → next event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 → next event1).
From the initial event2 and these rules the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, … (so event2 recurs).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (same wording as C2)
- C2: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication whose antecedent and consequent are the same statement (C1 and C2 are identical).
- C4: ""C3 always holds.""

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C3 is of the form P → P, which is a tautology (always true in every interpretation).
- A tautology “always holds,” so C3 is true in every case; therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True.

(If you meant some other reading of ""always happens"" that changes the truth of C1/C2, that doesn't matter for C4: C3 is still P → P and so C4 remains true.)

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (i.e., in the current/initial state event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means from the state where event1 has happened there are no further events/transitions; no successor state where a new event occurs.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" If event2 were to occur, event1 would have to occur (in the following state). This rule never gets triggered here because event2 does not occur in our scenario.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Given our initial state, this asks whether there is a successor state where event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (A disjunction; both disjuncts are about event2 occurring.)
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" (Disjunction of event1 and the previous disjunction.)
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" (Disjunction of event1 and C3.)

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- C1 is false: there is no next-state occurrence of event2 because after event1 no other events can happen.
- C2 is false: both disjuncts concern event2 and are false, so the disjunction is false.
- C3 is true: event1 does hold in the initial state, so ""event1 happens"" makes C3 true regardless of C2.
- C4 is true: since event1 holds, the disjunction ""event1 happens or C3 holds"" is true (indeed both disjuncts are true here).

Therefore C4 is True. (If one adopted a different formal semantics where ""next state"" is undefined and that affects truth values, the only relevant fact remains that event1 holds in the initial state, which makes C3 and C4 true.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next (or sometime after).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next (or sometime after).

These rules force an alternation: since event2 already happened, event1 must happen next; after that event2 must happen, then event1, and so on. So event1 will occur (indeed infinitely often) from the initial state.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (from the current time).
- C2: the same as C1 (it is stated identically).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some (current or future) time, the statement C2 will be true. Since C2 is itself ""event1 eventually happens"", C3 says that at some time in the future it will become true that event1 eventually happens.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" — the disjunction of C1 and C3.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C4
- From the initial event2 and the transition rules, event1 will happen next, so C1 is true.
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- Because C2 is already true (and, in fact, remains true at all times given the alternation), C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true as well.
- Therefore at least one of C1 or C3 is true; in fact both are true. Hence C4 is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True. (If you use a strict interpretation of ""eventually"" that excludes ""now"", the same conclusion holds because event1 does occur in the future immediately after the initial event2.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: From initial event2 and the alternating rules, event1 will occur (indeed infinitely often), so C1 (and thus C2) is true. Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is also true, so C1 ∨ C3 (C4) is true."

Short answer: C4 is True (it is a tautology). Explanation step by step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (event1 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs afterward.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterward.
- These two rules make event1 and event2 mutually forced: once event1 occurs, event2 must occur, which forces event1 again, etc. (Not needed to decide C4, but consistent with event1 holding repeatedly after the initial occurrence.)

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — logically this is identical to just ""event1"" (A or A = A).
- C2: the same as C1, so C2 = event1.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" = event1 and event1 = event1.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" = (event1) → event1.

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- C3 is equivalent to event1, so C4 is the implication event1 → event1.
- An implication p → p is always true (a tautology). Also, if event1 were false then the antecedent of C4 is false and the implication is still true.
- Therefore C4 is True in all cases.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 and C2 both reduce to ""event1"". So C3 is ""event1"". C4 is then ""event1 → event1"", which is a tautology (always true)."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” Meaning: whenever event2 occurs, there must be a (possibly later) occurrence of event1 after it.
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” Meaning: whenever event1 occurs, there must be a (possibly later) occurrence of event2 after it.
- Together these force that occurrences of the two events alternate in the future: from the initial event1 you get event2 sometime later, then event1 sometime later, then event2, etc. (The rules require eventual occurrences but do not force them to happen immediately — delays with no events between occurrences are allowed unless the model forbids idle steps.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3, C4
- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” This is ambiguous: it can be read as a state property (“right now, either event2 occurs or event1 occurs”) or as a temporal property (“at some time (now or later), event2 or event1 happens” / “eventually event1 or event2 happens”).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: “C1 holds or C2 holds.” Since C1 and C2 are the same, C3 is equivalent to C1.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” That means “at every time point, C3 is true” (again depending on whether C1 was intended as a “now” or “eventually” statement).

Step 4 — how they relate and whether C4 is true
- Under the usual reading that C1 means “right now either event1 or event2 occurs”: C4 is False. Counterexample timeline:
  - t=0: event1 occurs (initial).
  - t=1: no event.
  - t=2: event2 occurs.
  - t=3: no event.
  At t=1 (and t=3, etc.) neither event occurs, so C1 is false there, so C4 (“always C3”) fails.
- Under the reading that C1 means “eventually (from now) event1 or event2 will happen” (i.e., a liveness/“eventually” statement), then C1 is true at every time point (the alternation rules guarantee future occurrences), so C4 would be True.

Conclusion
- If “happens” in C1/C3/C4 means “happens right now”: C4 is False.
- If “happens” means “will happen eventually” (an eventuality/liveness claim): C4 is True.

If you meant one interpretation in particular, tell me which and I’ll restate the result just for that reading.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Interpreting ""happens"" as ""occurs right now"" (the natural reading for C1/C3/C4), the transition rules only require eventual future occurrences, not at every time step. So there can be times with no event (e.g., t=0: event1, t=1: no event), making ""always (event1 or event2 now)"" false."

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So the system forces an alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 … (event1 will occur after the initial event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is event1 → event1. In classical propositional logic this is a tautology (always true).
- C2: same as C1, so also a tautology (always true).
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. Since each of C1 and C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: C3 holds or event2 happens. This is (C3) ∨ (event2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because C1 and C2 are tautologies, C3 is true regardless of the events.
- Given C3 is true, the disjunction C4 = C3 ∨ event2 is necessarily true (a true ∨ anything is true).
- Independently, event2 also happened initially, so even if C3 were not considered, C4 would still be true because event2 is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True. (Under standard interpretation of ""if … then"" as material implication; C1 and C2 are tautologies, so C3 and therefore C4 are true.)

Summary answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (in the initial state).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So once either event occurs, there are no further events in subsequent states.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as the implication (event2 → event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" So C2 = (C1 is true) ∧ (event2 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That asserts that in the state immediately after the current one, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" That claims C3 is false.

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- We have a concrete counterexample to C1: event2 does happen (initially), but because “after event2 no other events can happen,” event1 cannot happen after event2. Therefore the implication event2 → event1 is false in this system (the antecedent occurs while the consequent does not).
- Since C1 is false, C2 = (C1 ∧ event2) is false even though event2 occurs (false ∧ true = false).
- The next state after the initial event2 has no events (because event2 is terminal), so C2 is not going to become true there; thus C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C4 asserts that C3 does not hold; since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at some point after event1, event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So any valid execution looks like: event1 occurs (initially), then event2 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 ≡ ""event1 happens."" Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 ≡ ""event1 happens."" C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Depending on interpretation:
  - If ""always"" means as a global property of the whole trace (""event1 happens somewhere in the trace""), then C2 already holds, and C3 is true (C2 holds in the trace, and thus ""always"" in the sense of being a true fact about the trace).
  - If ""always"" is the temporal operator G (holds at every state), then C3 would be false, because event1 only occurred initially and does not necessarily hold at later states after event2.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" So C4 is true if either C1 is true or C3 is true.

4) How do these relate and final verdict?
- C1 is true (because event1 happened initially). Therefore C4 = C1 ∨ C3 is true regardless of whether C3 is true or false under the temporal interpretation. Even in the stricter reading where C3 is false, C1 true makes C4 true.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

True

Reason: C1 is true (event1 happened initially), and C4 is C1 ∨ C3, so C4 is true regardless of the truth value of C3."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., eventually following any occurrence of event1 there must be an occurrence of event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

(These rules constrain possible event traces; they imply a trace starting with event1 must later contain a single event2 and then stop.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology about the same instant — P -> P — so C1 is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says C1 is true at every time point (globally). Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This says the statement ""C1 always holds"" is itself true at every time point. Given C2 is true at every time, C3 is also true (and G(G P) collapses to G P).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This says that at some time in the future, C3 is true. If C3 is true at all times, it is certainly true at some time — so C4 holds.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- C1 is a logical tautology, so it holds now and everywhere.
- Therefore C2 (always C1) holds.
- Therefore C3 (always C2) holds (redundant but true).
- Hence C4 (eventually C3) is true because C3 holds already (indeed, holds at all times).

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards (i.e., event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards (i.e., event2 ⇒ eventually event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (This matches the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"".)
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Same as C1; redundant.)
- C3: C1 and C2 both hold. (Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 just restates that property.)
- C4: Eventually C3 holds — i.e., at some time in the future (possibly now) both C1 and C2 are true.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the given rules, whenever event2 happens it is guaranteed that event1 will happen afterward. So C1 is true. C2 is the same statement, so it is also true.
- Therefore C3 (C1 ∧ C2) is true now.
- If C3 is true now, then it certainly ""eventually holds"" (the eventual operator is satisfied immediately). Hence C4 is true.

So C4 = True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1).
This yields an alternating sequence: event1, then event2, then event1, etc.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (event1 → event2)
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens. (C2 ∨ event2)
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. (C1 → C3)

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the transition rule, C1 is true. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3 = (C2 ∨ event2). Since C2 is true, C3 is true (an OR is true if either disjunct is true). Also, because event1 happened initially, event2 will happen next, so event2 is true as well — either way C3 holds.
- C4 is the implication C1 → C3. With C1 true and C3 true, the implication C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Transition constraints: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- From the state where event2 happened, the next state must have event1.
- From any state where event1 has just happened, no event can happen in the following state(s) (i.e., neither event1 nor event2 can occur after event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (a proposition P)
- C2: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (the same proposition P)
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” Formally: P → P.
- C4: “If event1 happens, then C3 holds.” Formally: (event1) → (P → P).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C4
- C1 and C2 are identical statements, so C3 is the implication P → P, which is a tautology (always true).
- Because C3 is always true, C4 (an implication whose consequent is always true) is itself true regardless of whether event1 actually happens.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point after the initial state).
- After event2, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is event2 → event2, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- C2: identical to C1, also a tautology (always true).
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. Since C1 and C2 are both true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asserts that at some time in the (possibly future) timeline C3 is true.

4) How they relate
- Because C1 and C2 are tautologies they hold now (and whenever), so C3 already holds. Therefore C3 certainly holds at some time — so C4 (“C3 eventually holds”) is true.
- (Even under stricter readings of ""eventually"" that exclude the present, the transition guarantees event2 will occur, but that is irrelevant here because C1/C2 do not depend on event2 actually occurring.)

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen after that (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the Ci
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — read as “there is no possible execution in which event1 does not happen” (i.e., event1 is not guaranteed by the system).
- C2: C1 holds AND event2 happens (so both: event1 is guaranteed, and event2 occurs).
- C3: C2 always holds (i.e., in every execution C2 is true).
- C4: C3 does not hold.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Nothing in the context forces event1 to occur. In particular, the initial trace where event2 already occurred and then nothing else can happen is a perfectly valid execution that contains no event1.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 is not guaranteed). Because C1 is false, C2 is false (its conjunction fails).
- Hence C3 (that C2 always holds) is also false.
- C4 states that C3 does not hold — that is true.

So C4 is True. A simple counterexample trace: the single-step execution where event2 happened initially and no event1 occurs; this satisfies the context and shows C1/C2/C3 are false, so C4 holds.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (in the initial/only reachable state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, no further events occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 ever happened, it would also terminate further activity).
- Because event1 happened initially and it blocks further events, event2 never happens in the reachable execution.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is either a tautology (A → A) or, at least, true in the actual state because event1 does happen.
- C2: identical to C1, so also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is the implication A → A, which is always true; or viewed extensionaly, C1 is true so C3's antecedent is true and its consequent is also true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This asks whether C3 is true in every (reachable) moment/state.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 are the same and true in the reachable state(s).
- C3 is an implication from C1 to C2; because they are identical (or both true), C3 holds.
- There is only the initial state (with event1) and no transitions to states where truth values could differ, so C3 holds in every reachable state.

Conclusion about C4:
- Since C3 is a tautologically true implication (and/or true in the only reachable state), C3 holds at all times. Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 and C2 are equivalent (A → A), so both hold in the reachable state. Hence C3 (C1 → C2) is true, and because there are no transitions to other states, C3 holds at all times. Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial condition?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we start immediately after an occurrence of event1).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.
Together these force an alternating (infinite) sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

(Here “must happen” is read as inevitability/liveness: once an event occurs, the other will occur next / eventually, so there is no permanent deadlock.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions:
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — there exists some future time where event2 occurs.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — at every point in time, it is true that event2 will eventually happen from that point.
- C3: “Event2 happens or C2 holds” — either event2 occurs now (or immediately), or the property C2 holds.
- C4: “C3 always holds” — at every point in time C3 is true.

4) How they relate and truth values:
- From the rules and the initial event1, event2 will occur next, so C1 is true at the start.
- Because the system alternates forever, at any reachable state there will be a future event2 (even right after an event2 you get event1 then event2). Thus C1 holds at every state, so C2 is true.
- Since C2 is true, the disjunction “event2 happens or C2 holds” is true at every state. So C3 is true (in particular true now).
- Because C3 holds at every state, C4 (“C3 always holds”) is true.

Conclusion: Under the stated interpretation, C4 is True.

(If “must happen” were intended differently — e.g. only possibly in some runs, or runs could terminate — the answer could change; but given inevitable alternation, C4 is True.)

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so in the current state event2 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in the successor/next state no events occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, then the next state must have event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e. successor state has event2)
- C2: ""If event2 happens (now), then C1 holds."" (i.e. current event2 implies event2 in the next state)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (i.e. C2 is false)
- C4: ""Event2 happens (now) or C3 holds."" (disjunction of current event2 and ¬C2)

4) How they relate / truth values
- Current state: event2 happened, so the antecedent of C2 is true.
- By ""after event2, no other events can happen"" the next state has no events, so C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (""if event2 now then C1"") is false (true antecedent, false consequent).
- Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
- Finally C4 = (event2 now) OR C3 = True OR True = True. (Either disjunct already makes the disjunction true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterwards.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Not needed here, but symmetric.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (¬(event2 ∧ event1)).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" (C2 → event1).
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" (event2 → C3).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition and the transition rule, event1 is true and event2 cannot happen. So event2 is false.
- C1 = event2 ∧ event1 is false (because event2 is false).
- C2 = ¬C1 is true.
- C3 = (C2 → event1). Antecedent C2 is true and consequent event1 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4 = (event2 → C3). There are two ways to see C4 is true:
  1. Vacuous truth: event2 is false, so any implication with event2 as antecedent is true.
  2. Also C3 is actually true regardless, so even if event2 were true the implication's consequent would hold.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so event1 is true at the initial time).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (if event2 then later event1).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (if event1 then later event2).
- Together these imply an alternating sequence after the start: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → …

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is event1 → event1. That is a logical tautology (always true).
- C2: same as C1 (also event1 → event1), so also always true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" The conjunction of two true statements is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This asks whether C3 is true at all times.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C4 true?
- Since C1 and C2 are tautologies (each event1 → event1 is true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs), C3 is true at every state. Therefore C3 always holds, so C4 is true.

Note: If the intended C1/C2 were meant to express the transition rules (e.g., ""if event2 then event1"" and ""if event1 then event2""), the answer would be different; based on the literal statements given, C1 and C2 are trivial tautologies and C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
Given event2 already happened initially and it is terminal, no further events (including event1) can ever occur in any execution.

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (read as: in every possible execution, event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point (including now) we reach a state where C1 is true.)
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event2 happened initially and no further events can occur, event2 occurs in every execution → C1 (and thus C3) is true.
- Since C1 already holds, ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true as well.
- Therefore C4 = C2 OR C3 is true (both disjuncts are true).

Conclusion: C4 is True.

Reasoning (brief):

Short answer: C4 is True (under the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events (interpreting ""after"" as ""in the next state""):
- After event2, event1 must happen → from state0 (where event2 occurred) the next state (state1) must have event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → in the state after the state with event1 (state2 and thereafter) no events occur.

So the canonical timeline is:
- state0: event2
- state1: event1
- state2, state3, ...: no events

3) What each sub-condition means:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Evaluated at state0, that says event1 occurs in state1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: at state1, C1 is true — i.e. at state1, event1 happens in the next state (so event1 would have to occur in state2). So C2 = ""event1 occurs two steps from state0.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 is the statement that event1 does not occur two steps from state0.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication evaluated at the same reference point (state0): if C3 is true, then event2 happens (here understood as happening in the current state unless another timing is specified).

4) How the conditions relate and truth values:
- C1: True. From the rules, state1 has event1.
- C2: False. At state1 there is no event1 in the next state (state2 has no events), so C1 is false when checked at state1.
- C3: True. It asserts C2 does not hold, and C2 is false.
- C4: True. C4 is an implication ""if C3 then event2."" At state0 C3 is true, and event2 did happen at state0, so the consequent is true; therefore the implication is true.

Note on ambiguity: If the timing of the consequent in C4 were intended differently (e.g., ""if C3 holds then event2 happens in the next state""), the truth could change. Under the natural reading above (all conditions evaluated at the same reference state, and ""event2 happens"" referring to the already-given initial event2), C4 is true.

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Given that event2 has already happened initially and it is terminal, no further events (in particular event1) can ever occur after the initial moment.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the initial event2 and the terminal rule for event2, C1 is true (event1 cannot occur).
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication P → P with P = “event1 does not happen,” so it is logically true (true whenever P is true, and in fact tautologically true because the antecedent and consequent are the same).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether at some time C3 is true. Since C3 is already true (indeed true at all times in this scenario), C3 eventually holds.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- From the initial event2 and the terminal rules we get C1 and C2 true.
- C3 is a true implication (P→P).
- Therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true (C3 holds now and hence holds at some time).

(If one worries about the technicality whether “eventually” excludes the present instant: it does not matter here because C3 holds at all times, so it holds at some later instant or at the present instant as required.)

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen — formalized as: event1 -> event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen — formalized as: event2 -> event1.
- From these two rules we get event1 ↔ event2 (they imply each other). Given the initial event2, event1 will occur (and then event2 again, etc., if you view this temporally).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally event1 -> event1. This is a logical tautology (every proposition implies itself), so C1 is true.
- C2: Same as C1 (event1 -> event1), so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally C1 -> C2. Since both C1 and C2 are true tautologies, C3 is true. (More generally, because C2 is true, any implication with consequent C2 is true.)
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Formally event2 -> C3. We must decide whether this implication is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and final evaluation?
- We have established C3 is true independently of event2.
- Therefore the implication event2 -> C3 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent). So C4 is true.
- Note: even using the event-transition rules, event2 is true initially and event2 implies event1, but that temporal detail is unnecessary for the truth of C4 because C3 is already true unconditionally.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — i.e. not C3.

- Therefore C2 = not C1 is false.
- C3 is the implication (event2 → C2). Because event2 is true, the implication requires C2 to be true; but C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Short answer: C4 is True (under the usual interpretation that ""eventually"" allows the present). Below is the step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So once either event occurs, no further events occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (implication)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" (implication)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" (temporal eventuality: C3 holds at some time ≥ now)

4) How these relate (evaluate truth values given the initial situation)
- C1: False. Since event2 has happened and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not happen in the next state.
- C2: False. The antecedent (event2 happens) is true, but the consequent (C1) is false, so the implication is false.
- C3: True. C2 is false, so ""if C2 then event1"" is vacuously true.
- C4: True. C3 already holds now, so ""eventually C3"" is true under the standard semantics where ""eventually"" includes the current state.

Caveat: if you adopt a nonstandard reading where ""eventually"" means ""at some strictly later state"" and there are no later states at all (because the current state is terminal), then C4 would be false. Under the usual temporal-logic convention (eventually = at some time ≥ now), C4 is true.

Short answer: C4 is True — vacuously true. Below is the step‑by‑step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened. Also we are given: after event1 no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, nothing else can happen.
- Rule B: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards (event2 -> eventually event1).

Given Rule A and the initial occurrence of event1, no events can occur after that initial time. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — true (event2 cannot happen because event1 already happened and forbids further events).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — true (since event2 never happens at any time).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — false (negation of a true statement).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" — logical implication C3 → event2.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and final evaluation of C4?
- Truth values so far: C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = False.
- In standard logic an implication with a false antecedent is True. Since C3 is false, C4 (C3 → event2) is True (vacuously true).
- Important note: C4 being True does not mean event2 actually happens; it only means ""if C3 were true, then event2 would happen."" But C3 is false, and event2 in fact does not happen.

So C4 is True (vacuously true under the usual truth‑table for implication).

Reasoning (brief):

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: Initially event1 happened (so we start in a state where event1 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from the state where event1 happened, the next step leads to a state where event2 happens).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state with event2 is terminal — there is no further state with events).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (a property of a state: its immediate successor is a state where event2 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (for every state along the execution, C1 is true)
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" (in any state where event2 happens, it must be that C2 is true)
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" (in any state where event1 happens, it must be that C3 is true)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the transition rules, in the state after the initial event1, event2 does indeed happen next, so C1 is true in the event1-state.
- But C2 asserts that C1 holds in every state. That fails because in the state where event2 happens (a terminal state) there is no next state with event2, so C1 is not true there. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3 is the implication ""if event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Because event2 does happen (in the successor state), and C2 is false, the implication C3 is false (an actual occurrence of event2 witnesses the antecedent while the consequent fails).
- C4 is ""if event1 happens, then C3 holds."" We do have event1 initially, but C3 is false (see previous point), so the implication in C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is false. (If you use different conventions about ""next"" or about terminal states — e.g., treating ""next"" as ""eventually"" or treating next-undefined states differently — the evaluation can change, but under the usual interpretation above C4 is false.)

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (the system becomes terminal after event1).
- Rule B: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.

3) What each sub-condition means (reading them as standard temporal operators)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1) — there exists some future state where C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (G C3) — C3 is true in every state.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no events (including event1 again) can occur in any future state.
- Therefore C1 (event1 in the next state) is false at the initial state.
- If C1 is never true in any future state, C2 (eventually C1) is false.
- If C2 is false now, then C3 (X C2) is false.
- If C3 is false (and not true in all states), then C4 (always C3) is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False. (If you meant a different semantics for ""happened"" — e.g., that event1 is a persistent fact rather than a one-time occurrence — say so and I can re-evaluate under that reading.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already occurred and Rule A makes the system terminal, so event1 cannot occur in any future state. Hence C1 (X event1) is false now, so C2 (F C1) is false, C3 (X C2) is false, and therefore C4 (G C3) is false."

I'll step through each question and then give the verdict for C4. I’ll also point out the two common readings of “happens” (local/instant vs. existential over the whole run) because the answer depends on that.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initially) event2 happened. After that initial occurrence, no other events can happen (the system does nothing after that initial event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: “After event2, no other events can happen.” So once event2 has occurred, the run has no further events.
- Rule B: “After event1, event2 must happen.” If event1 ever occurs at some time, then at some (later or possibly the same) time event2 must occur afterwards.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens or event2 happens.” (a disjunction)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 and C2 — i.e. the same disjunction holds (twice), so C3 is equivalent to C1 (and C2).
- C4: “C3 always holds.” This is a temporal claim meaning: at every time point in the run, C3 is true (often written G C3).

Note: There are two reasonable readings of “EventX happens” in C1/C2:
  A. Instantaneous/current-time reading: “EventX happens” is true only at the time instant when that event occurs (a proposition true at the moment of the event).
  B. Existential-over-run reading: “EventX happens” means “EventX occurs at some time in the entire run” (a global fact about the trace).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and what's C4)?
- Under reading B (existential over the whole run):
  - The run contains event2 (initially), so “event2 happens” is true as a global fact. Thus C1 and C2 are true; C3 (their conjunction) is true; since these are global truths about the run, “always C3” is also true. So C4 would be True.

- Under reading A (instantaneous/current-time reading), which is the usual interpretation when “always” (G) is used and C1 is a propositional condition evaluated at each time point:
  - At time 0, event2 happens, so C1 and C2 hold at time 0 and C3 holds at time 0.
  - At any later time, no events happen (by rule A). At those later times neither “event1 happens” nor “event2 happens” is true, so C1 (and C2, and hence C3) are false at those later times.
  - Therefore C3 is not true at every time point, so “always C3” (C4) is false.

Conclusion (most natural temporal-logic reading)
- If we treat “happens” as a time-local predicate and C4 as a temporal-operator claim (“C3 holds at every time”), then C4 is False.
- If instead “happens” means “occurs somewhere in the run” (a global existential), then C4 is True.  

Given the presence of the temporal word “always,” the intended/standard reading is the time-local one, so the correct answer is: C4 is False.

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from the initial state, event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does not eventually happen).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not the case that event1 does not eventually happen). Thus C3 is equivalent to C1 (C3 says event1 does eventually happen).
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" Formally: event1 ⇒ C3.

4) How they relate and final deduction
- From the initial condition and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", we conclude C1 is true (event1 will eventually happen).
- Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is false, and C3 (the negation of C2) is true. So C3 holds unconditionally in this scenario.
- C4 is the implication event1 ⇒ C3. Since C3 is true, the implication holds (an implication with a true consequent is true). Also, in fact event1 does occur here, so antecedent true and consequent true, making the implication true.

Therefore C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (i.e. once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. if event2 ever occurs, it is followed by event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
Interpreting the Ci with standard temporal operators (F = eventually, G = always):
- C1: event2 does not happen (¬event2, i.e. event2 never occurs).
- C2: C1 eventually holds = F(¬event2) (at some future point C1 is true).
- C3: C2 always holds = G F(¬event2) (at every point in time, eventually ¬event2 holds).
- C4: C3 always holds = G G F(¬event2). (Note G G is redundant, so C4 ≡ G F(¬event2) ≡ C3.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event1 happened initially and Rule A forbids any further events, event2 can never occur. So C1 (¬event2) is true right away (and from then on).
- If C1 is true immediately, then F(¬event2) is true (C2), and therefore G F(¬event2) is true (C3). Since C4 is just another G around C3 (and G G = G), C4 is true as well.

Therefore C4 is True.

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happened (so event1 is true now).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen — the state where event1 happened has no outgoing transitions (no next state with any event).
- After event2, event1 must happen in the following state (if event2 ever occurs, the next state must have event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to simply event1 (a tautology collapsed to event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. next(event1).
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is event1 (true in the initial state).
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" — i.e. next(event1) OR event1.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- In the initial state event1 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4 = C2 ∨ C3; since C3 is true, C4 is true regardless of whether C2 (next(event1)) is true or false.
- (If needed: under the ""no next state after event1"" rule, next(event1) would be false, but that does not affect the disjunction because C3 already makes C4 true.)

Short answer: C4 is False (under the usual interpretation that events are instantaneous occurrences). Explanation step by step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred at the start.

2) Transition rules
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — i.e. from the initial state there will be some later state where event1 occurs (event1 is eventual).
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — event1 is terminal: once it occurs, the system stops producing further events.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (in temporal-logic style)
- C1 = “event1 eventually happens” = F(event1). Given the rule after event2, C1 is true.
- C2 = “C1 holds and event1 happens” = F(event1) ∧ event1. This is true exactly at the instant when event1 occurs (at that instant event1 is true, and the eventuality F(event1) is satisfied).
- C3 = “C2 always holds” = G(C2). This would require C2 to be true at every moment in time — i.e. event1 to be true at every moment — which is not satisfied by a single instantaneous occurrence.
- C4 = “C3 eventually holds” = F(G(C2)). This says there is some time after which C2 holds at every future moment (i.e. from some point onward C2 is permanently true).

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- C1 is true (event1 will occur).
- C2 is true only at the instant event1 occurs.
- C3 is false because C2 does not hold at all times (it holds only at one instant).
- C4 asks for some time after which C2 holds forever; since C2 only holds at a single instant and not permanently afterward, there is no time after which C2 is always true. Therefore C4 is false.

Note on semantics: If you instead interpret “event1” as a persistent proposition (once true it remains true forever), then after event1 occurs C2 (event1 ∧ F(event1)) could hold at every future moment and C4 would be true. The answer above assumes the standard instantaneous-occurrence reading of “event happened.”

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so event1 is true in the actual run).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” — event2 is also terminal if it ever occurs.
Given the initial condition that event1 happened, no events can occur after that point (so event2 cannot occur later).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (This is false in the actual run because event2 did not occur; event1 happened and prevents further events.)
- C2: “Event2 always happens.” (same as C1, also false)
- C3: “C1 holds and C2 holds.” (false, since C1 and C2 are false)
- C4: “C3 holds or event1 happens.” This is a disjunction of (false) and (true), because event1 did happen.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 are identical/redundant; both are false given the initial event1 and the rule that nothing can follow event1.
- C3 is false because it requires both C1 and C2.
- C4 is true because event1 happened, making the disjunction true regardless of C3.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the start) event2 has occurred.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur at some later time.
- Rule B: After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur at some later time.
So the rules force alternating occurrences: event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Interpreted as a global claim that event1 never occurs.
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds.” (Conjunction: event2 occurs and event1 never occurs.)
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” (At some time in the future C2 is true.)
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” (At some future time it becomes true that ‘eventually C2’ holds.)

(Also note the temporal logic identity: eventually(eventually P) is equivalent to eventually P, so C4 is equivalent to C3.)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event2 and Rule A, event1 must occur later. Therefore the global claim C1 (“event1 never occurs”) is false.
- Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false (even though event2 did occur, C1 fails).
- If C2 can never become true (because C1 is impossible under the rules), then C3 (“eventually C2”) is false.
- Hence C4 is also false (equivalently, C4 ⇔ C3).

Therefore: C4 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Also given: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So each event, if it occurs, is terminal (no further events occur afterward).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either occurs, the system stops and no further events can occur.
- Because event2 already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state and no further events (including event1) can ever occur.

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” (i.e., event1 never occurs).
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens” — a conjunction requiring both that event1 never happens and that event1 does happen (contradictory).
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens” — disjunction.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” — at some time in the future (possibly now) C3 is true.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth values
- C1 is true: since event2 happened initially and after event2 nothing else can happen, event1 does not (and cannot) happen.
- C2 is false: it asserts both that event1 does not happen (true) and that event1 happens (false); the conjunction is false.
- C3 is true: event2 happens (true), so the disjunction (C2 or event2) is true regardless of C2.
- C4 is true: C3 already holds now (because event2 happened initially), so “eventually C3” is satisfied.

Reasoning (brief):
- Let s0 be the initial state. s0: event2 holds.
- Rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" implies s1 and all later states have no events (neither event1 nor event2).
- Therefore in s1 and s2 event1 and event2 are false, so C1 (""event2 and event1"") is false in every state after s0 (and not given true in s0).
- C2 at a state says ""C1 holds in the next state."" So C2 is false at s0 (C1 false in s1) and false at s1 (C1 false in s2).
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Thus C3 is true in s1 (since C2 is false there).
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"" — evaluated at s0 this asks whether C3 is true in s1, which it is.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the current state (call it S0), event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
  (From a state where event2 occurred, the next state must have event1.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
  (From a state where event1 occurred, the next state must have event2.)
So behavior alternates: S0: event2 → S1: event1 → S2: event2 → S3: event1 → …

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 happens in the next state (i.e., in S1 relative to S0).
- C2: event1 happens in the next state (same as C1).
- C3: C1 and C2 both hold (so C3 is equivalent to “event1 happens in the next state”).
- C4: If C3 holds, then event2 happens. (This is an implication; we must fix what “happens” means temporally.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial condition (S0: event2), Rule A forces S1 to have event1. Therefore C1 and C2 are true at S0, so C3 is true.
- Given C3 (i.e., event1 in S1), Rule B forces S2 to have event2. So event2 does happen (in S2).

Conclusion about C4:
- If C4 is interpreted as “If C3 holds, then event2 will (eventually) happen” or “then event2 happens in a subsequent state” — C4 is True, because C3 → event1 in S1 and that implies event2 in S2 by the given rules.
- If C4 is interpreted more strictly as “If C3 holds, then event2 happens in the next state (i.e., the same next state where event1 occurs)” — C4 would be False, because event2 does not occur in S1; it occurs in the state after that (S2).

So under the usual reading of the alternating rules (event2 occurs one step after event1), C4 is true when “happens” means “happens subsequently/eventually,” but false if “happens” is required to mean “happens in the immediately next state.”

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From S0 (event2) Rule A gives S1: event1, so C3 holds. Then by Rule B, from S1:event1 we get S2:event2. Hence C3 ⇒ event2 (event2 occurs subsequently). Note: if ""happens"" were required to mean ""in the same next state as event1"" the implication would be false, but under the usual temporal reading (event2 occurs in the following state) C4 is True."

Short answer: C4 is True (under the usual semantics of ""eventually"").

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 happened (so the system is in a state where event2 has occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen"" mean both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either happens, the execution stops (no further events/transitions).

2) Transition rules
- From the initial state (where event2 happened) there are no outgoing transitions (no further events can happen).
- In particular, event1 never occurs in this execution.

3) Meaning of sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event1 → event1. This is a tautology; it is true in all states, and in particular it is vacuously true in any state where event1 does not occur.
- C2: same as C1, so also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true now.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" The usual meaning of ""eventually"" (the temporal F operator) is that there exists some time point now or in the future where the proposition holds. Since C3 already holds in the current (initial) state, the eventuality is satisfied immediately.

4) Relation and conclusion
- Because C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true, and therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

Note on semantics: If one used a nonstandard reading of ""eventually"" requiring a strictly later state and the trace has no later states (execution immediately terminates), then under that strict reading C4 could be considered false. Under standard temporal logic conventions (eventually includes the current state, or the existence of some state in the finite trace where the property holds), C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start of the timeline).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (event1 ⇒ later event2).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event2 ⇒ later event1).
Together these force an alternation: since event2 already happened, event1 must occur next, then event2 again, then event1, etc. So both events will occur (indeed infinitely often under these rules).

Step 3 — meaning of the Ci conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens.” (i.e., both events occur sometime in the timeline.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (interpreted in the usual temporal sense: at every moment/state C1 is true.)
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” (the negation of C2.)
- C4: “Event1 happens or C3 holds.” (disjunction of event1 and C3.)

Step 4 — how these relate and evaluation
- C1 is true in the system because, from the initial event2 and the mutual-after rules, both events will occur (event2 already did; event1 will occur next).
- C2 is false. Under the usual meaning of “always,” C1 does not hold at every moment: immediately at the initial point event1 had not yet happened, so the proposition “event1 happens and event2 happens” is not true at that moment. (More generally, “always C1” would require both events to be instantaneously true at every time, which the alternating behavior does not provide.)
- Therefore C3 (“C2 does not hold”) is true.
- C4 is “event1 happens or C3 holds.” Since C3 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 has occurred yet.

Conclusion
C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is satisfied (both events occur), but C2 (""always C1"") is false, so C3 (not C2) is true. Therefore C4 (""event1 happens or C3"") is true regardless of whether event1 has occurred, because C3 is true."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (so event2 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 happens then event2 will happen).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; once event2 has happened, nothing further can occur).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally: event2 → event2. This is a tautology (an instance of reflexivity of implication); given the system facts it is true (event2 did happen and the consequent is the same).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → C1. Since C1 is true (see above), C2 is true whenever event2 happens; and because event2 did happen initially, C2 is true in this scenario.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is true by the same reasoning.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Formally: C2 ∨ C3.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C4?

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2.
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (and it already has), no further events can occur at any later time.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterward).

Because event1 already happened initially and it forbids any later events, event2 can never occur in this scenario.

2) Transition rules between events
- event1 is terminal: no events after it.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" imposes a requirement only if event2 occurs. Since event2 cannot occur here, that requirement is never triggered (it is vacuously satisfied).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". (Redundant disjunction.)
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens = (event2 happens) AND (event1 happens).
- C3: If C2 holds, then event1 happens = (C2 ⇒ event1). Logically, since C2 already includes ""event1 happens"", this implication is always true when interpreted propositionally (if p∧q then q).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = at some point in time C3 is true (in temporal terms).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From (1), event1 is true initially; event2 is false (cannot happen).
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 is false (false AND true = false).
- C3 is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true; also C2 already contains event1 so the implication is tautological).
- C3 holds immediately, therefore ""eventually C3"" is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event2 happens.
- Also given: after event2, event1 must happen. So event1 happens as well.
- After event1 no other events occur. So the actual sequence is: event2, then event1, and nothing after.

2) Transition rules
- event2 implies event1 (event2 -> event1).
- event1 implies no further events; there are no additional occurrences after event1.

3) Meaning and truth of each condition
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — since both happen, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (C1 -> event2). C1 is true and event2 is true, so the implication is true; C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" (event1 -> C2). event1 is true and C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" (C3 ∨ event2). Both C3 and event2 are true, so C4 is true.

4) How they relate
- Because event2 actually happens, any disjunction that includes event2 is true, and any implication whose consequent is event2 is satisfied when event2 is true. The chain event2 -> event1 ensures C1 is true and hence C2 and C3 become true as well. Therefore C4 (C3 ∨ event2) is true.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1. What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (it happened initially).

2. What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Because event2 happened initially and it is terminal, no further events can occur after the initial state.

3. What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since event2 has already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is the same statement as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This says that at some (possibly future) point C2 is true. C2 is already true now, so C3 is also true. (Note: in temporal logic F(F p) = F p, so ""eventually (eventually event2)"" is equivalent to ""eventually event2"".)

4. How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 are the same statement (both assert that event2 eventually happens).
- C3 is equivalent to C2 in this setting (and more generally F(F p) = F p), so C1, C2, C3 are all true here.

Therefore C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true: the antecedent C1 is true and the consequent C3 is true, so the implication holds. (Even if C1 were false, the implication would still be true; but here both are true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
Interpretation A (literal reading of what you wrote):
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is logically equivalent to just ""event1 happens"" (a duplicate conjunct adds nothing).
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — since C2 is just ""event1 happens"" and event1 already happened initially, C2 already holds now, so C3 (that C2 holds at some time) is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" — with C1 true (event1 did happen) and C3 true, C4 is true.

Interpretation B (possible intended reading: C1 meant ""event1 and event2""):
- If C1 = (event1 and event2), then C1 is true because event1 occurred and, by the rule, event2 must occur afterwards. If C2 is the duplicate or otherwise true as in A, C3 is true. So C4 = C1 ∨ C3 is still true.

Caveat (if the duplicate was intended to mean two distinct occurrences of event1):
- If ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" was meant to require two separate occurrences of event1 at different times, then that requirement is not met by the scenario (we have one event1 followed by event2 and then nothing), so C1 and C2 would be false, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") false, and C4 false. This is only relevant if you meant ""two occurrences of event1"" rather than a duplicated conjunct.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Under the natural (literal or likely intended) readings, event1 occurred, event2 must occur, so either C1 (if interpreted as a single occurrence or as event1∧event2) or C3 holds, and therefore C4 = C1 ∨ C3 is True.
- Only if the duplicated text really means ""two separate occurrences of event1"" (an atypical reading) would C4 be False.

Short conclusion: With the usual interpretations, C4 is True. If you meant something else by the duplicated phrases, tell me and I’ll re-evaluate.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so any event2 is followed later by event1).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so any event1 is followed later by event2).
Together with the initial event1, these rules force an infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P) and is always true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since event1 does happen (initially, and repeatedly by the alternation) and C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether at some time C3 becomes true (i.e., whether C2 ever becomes false).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- C1 is true, so C2 reduces to just ""Event1 happens,"" which is true given the initial condition and the forcing rules.
- Therefore C3 is false, and there is no moment at which C3 becomes true.
Conclusion: C4 is False.

(If you instead interpret ""Event1 happens"" in C2 as a pointwise predicate that is true only at the instants when event1 occurs, then C2 is true at each event1 instant and false at other instants; even then, because event1 recurs indefinitely, C2 is true infinitely often and C3 can be true at the instants between event1 occurrences only if you evaluate at those instants. Under the natural global reading used above, C4 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C1 is a tautology, so C2 holds (event1 does occur and C1 is true). Hence C3 (the negation of C2) never holds, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false."

Short answers up front: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., event2 will happen at or after the point event1 happened).
- After event2 occurs, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (Given the initial condition, this is true — event1 already happened.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This claims C2 is true at all times. Because C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

4) How they relate and final truth value
- C2 = ¬C1, C3 = always(C2), C4 = ¬C3.
- With event1 true initially, C1 is true → C2 false → C3 false → C4 true.

Note on semantics: This uses the usual interpretation that ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied when event1 already occurs at the initial time (or more generally at some time ≥ now). If you use a strictly ""future-only"" reading that excludes the present, adjust accordingly — but with the given statement (""Initially, event1 happened"") the natural reading makes C1 true and therefore C4 true.

Answer: C4 is False (under the usual semantics where ""in the next state"" requires an actual successor state).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true; event1 is not asserted).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen — i.e. any state where event2 has happened has no successor with further events.
- After event1, no other events can happen — similarly any state with event1 is terminal.
- So both event1 and event2 states are terminal (there is no next state after the initial state).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"". In the initial state this is true because event2 happened.
- C2: same as C1, so also true in the initial state.
- C3: C1 and C2 — both true, so C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — this asserts there exists a successor state and that C3 is true there.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since the initial state is terminal (no next state), there is no successor in which to evaluate C3. Under standard temporal logic semantics the next-state formula Xϕ (or ""ϕ in the next state"") is false when no next state exists. Therefore C4 is false.

Note: If you used a nonstandard semantics where a terminal state's ""next"" is interpreted as itself (or the model is extended to loop), then C4 could be true; with the plain reading given (""after event2 no other events can happen"" meaning no successor), C4 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The initial state is terminal (event2 happened and no successor exists), so ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3) is false under standard next-state semantics where a next-state must exist."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state with event2 is terminal — no successor).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the state with event1 is also terminal).

3) What each sub-condition means (and its truth value under the given model)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since there is no state where event1 actually occurs, this implication is vacuously true. So C1 = True.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is True and event2 holds in the initial state, so C2 = True (in the initial state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" But the initial state (with event2) is terminal — there is no next state. Under the usual semantics where Xφ (next φ) is false if there is no successor, C3 = False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because there are no successor states and C3 is false now, C3 will never become true, so C4 = False.

4) How they relate and final answer
- C1 and C2 are true in the initial state; however there is no next state, so C3 is false and therefore C4 (""eventually C3"") is false.

Note on alternate semantics: If one instead assumed an infinite ""stuttering"" continuation that preserves the same state so a successor exists, then C3 (and thus C4) could be true. Under the natural reading of ""no other events can happen"" as ""no successor state,"" C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state is terminal (no successor), so C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false, and thus C4 (""eventually C3"") cannot become true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 happened (at least once, initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After E1 occurs, E2 must occur (E1 → next E2).
- After E2 occurs, E1 must occur (E2 → next E1).
This enforces alternation: once one event happens the other will happen next; starting from E2 this produces an ongoing sequence E2, E1, E2, E1, ...

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
Write E1 for “event1 happens” and E2 for “event2 happens”.
- C1: E1 ∨ E2.
- C2: E1 ∨ E2 (same as C1).
- C3: C1 ∧ C2 = (E1 ∨ E2) ∧ (E1 ∨ E2) = E1 ∨ E2.
- C4: E2 ∨ C3 = E2 ∨ (E1 ∨ E2).

Step 4 — relations and truth of C4
- Simplify C4: E2 ∨ (E1 ∨ E2) = E1 ∨ E2.
- So C4 is equivalent to C1 (and C2, C3).
- Since initially E2 happened, E2 is true, hence E1 ∨ E2 is true.

I'll go step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., in the run/history, event2 occurs at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then at some later point event1 will occur.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal; nothing can occur after it.)

Together with the initial condition, the allowed timeline is: event2 occurs (initially) → event1 occurs (must follow) → then nothing else.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (A claim that event2 never occurs in the run.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (Negation of C1; i.e., event2 does happen.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (Says that C2 is true at all relevant times — effectively that it is a true fact of the run.)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (Negation of C3.)

4) How the conditions relate and truth values
- From the initial condition, event2 does happen, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is true.
- C2 being true is a factual statement about the run; so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also true (there is no changing the fact that event2 happened).
- Consequently C4, which is the negation of C3, is false.

Final answer: C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 did happen, so C1 is false, hence C2 is true; C2 remains true throughout the run so C3 is true, and C4 (the negation of C3) is therefore false."

Answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0) event1 happened (event1 is true at state0). Event2 is not true at state0.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen in any successor state (the system becomes eventless / terminal after event1).
- After event2 happens, likewise no other events can happen.
- Given the initial condition (event1 at state0) the future states exist but no events (neither event1 nor event2) will occur there.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” (next(event1)).
- C2: “C1 always holds” (globally C1, i.e. C1 at every state).
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens” (C2 ∨ event2).
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” (finally C3, i.e. C3 at some future state, possibly now).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- At state0: event1 = true, event2 = false.
- C1 at state0 is false because the next state has no events (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- C2 is false because C1 is already false at state0 (so C1 does not hold at every state).
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2 is false (both disjuncts false).
- C3 never becomes true in any future state (no events ever occur after state0), so C4 = “eventually C3” is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False — next(event1) is already false at the initial state and no future events occur, so C3 never holds and thus C4 (eventually C3) is false."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event2 happens.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs at some time t, event1 occurs at some later time — here taken as the next state/time t+1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 is followed by event2).
- Together these rules force an alternating sequence: event2 at t0, event1 at t1, event2 at t2, event1 at t3, … (or at least ensure event1 occurs after any event2 and event2 after any event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — i.e. at the current state/time, event1 is false.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — i.e. from the current state onward, C1 is true at every state (equivalently: event1 never happens at any future time).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — i.e. at time t+1 (the next state) it is true that event1 never happens from that point onward.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” — the negation of C3.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- From the rules and initial condition we have: at time 0 event2 holds, so at time 1 event1 must hold. Therefore C1 is false at time 1 (since event1 happens there). Because C1 fails at time 1, C2 (which requires C1 to hold at all future times) is false at time 0 (and also false at time 1).
- C3 asserts that C2 holds at the next state (time 1). But C2 is false at time 1, so C3 is false.
- C4 is the negation of C3; since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Thus C4 is true. (Same conclusion holds if “after” means “eventually after” rather than immediate next state: event1 still occurs at some future time, so “event1 never happens” is false and C3 is false, so C4 true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- The events are event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" i.e., (event1 eventually happens) ⇒ (event2 happens).
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds.""

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- From the initial condition and the rule after event2, event1 must happen; therefore C1 (and C2) is true.
- C3 is an implication whose antecedent (C2) is true and whose consequent (event2 happens) is also true (event2 happened initially). Thus C3 is true.
- C4 is C1 ∧ C3, so C4 is true ∧ true = True.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Therefore the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ….

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the formula P → P for P = “event1 happens.” That is a logical tautology (true whenever P is considered at the same point/state). So C1 holds.
- C2: The same as C1 (identical statement), so C2 also holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds (at the current and every state), it certainly holds at some future point; thus C3 holds. (Even if “eventually” were interpreted as strictly future, the alternating behavior guarantees C2 holds at every state, so C3 still holds.)
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true.

4) Relations and final truth value
- C1 is true, C2 is true, and therefore C3 is true. Thus the disjunction C4 = C1 ∨ C3 is true (in fact both disjuncts are true). Hence C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False (under the usual linear-time “next” semantics). Below are the steps.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 no other events can happen → the state reached after event1 is terminal (no successor).
- After event2 no other events can happen → the state after event2 is also terminal.
- Since we start in the state reached by event1, there is no next state reachable from the initial state.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “event1 happens or event2 happens” — this is true in the initial state because event1 has happened.
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds” — logically this is the implication event1 → (event1 ∨ event2), which is a tautology; it is true in any state where the propositions are interpreted classically.
- C3: “C2 always holds” — meaning C2 is true in every reachable state. Since C2 is a tautology, C3 is true in every state (including the initial one).
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” — this asserts that the immediate successor state satisfies C3.

4) How they relate and final truth value of C4
- There is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so the statement “C3 holds in the next state” depends on your semantics of the next operator:
  - Under the usual linear-time (LTL-style) semantics where Xφ requires an actual next state, Xφ is false at a terminal state. So C4 is False.
  - In some branching-style or “for all successors” formulations where universal quantification over an empty successor set is treated as vacuously true, one might consider C4 true. (This is a different semantic choice.)
- Under the common interpretation used in LTL/linear traces: C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (initially event2 happened).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. event1 inevitably occurs at some later time).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event1 does not eventually happen"" (the negation of C1).
- C3: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" = (¬C1 → C1).

4) How do these relate?
- From the initial condition and Rule A, event1 must (eventually) happen, so C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (¬C1) is false, and C3 is true.
- The implication C4 (¬C1 → C1) is true in two equivalent ways:
  a) An implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false) is True.
  b) Logically (¬P → P) is equivalent to P, so C4 is equivalent to C1, which we already have as True.

Short answer: C4 is True (at the initial state), under the natural reading below.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial condition?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state; event1 did not (so at time 0: event2 = true, event1 = false).

2) Transition rules (assumption: ""after"" = immediately in the next state)
- After event1, event2 must happen → whenever event1 holds in some state, event2 holds in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen → whenever event2 holds in some state, event1 holds in the next state.
- With the initial event2, the next state will have event1; then the next will have event2, etc. (they alternate).

3) What each condition means
- C1: event1 does not happen now (¬event1 in the current state).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e. in the next state ¬event1).
- C3: If event1 happens now, then C2 holds (event1 → next(¬event1) evaluated at the current state).
- C4: C3 holds now, or event1 happens now (C3 ∨ event1).

4) How they relate / truth values (evaluated at the initial state)
- Current state: event1 = false, event2 = true.
- Next state: by the rules, event1 = true (so ¬event1 is false in the next state).
- C1 (¬event1 now): True.
- C2 (¬event1 in next state): False.
- C3 (event1 → C2) at the current state: antecedent is false (event1 is false now), so the implication is vacuously true. Hence C3 = True.
- C4 = C3 ∨ event1 = True ∨ False = True.

Notes on interpretations:
- If ""after"" were interpreted as “eventually” instead of “immediately next”, the same evaluation at the initial state still makes C3 true (antecedent false) and thus C4 true at the initial state.
- If instead C3 were required to hold in all future states (a global property) you'd have to check states where event1 is true; in those states C3 could be false because C2 is false there. But as formulated and evaluated at the initial state, C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur thereafter).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (a global implication about the system/run)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (the implication C1 ⇒ C2)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" (there is some time at which C3 is true)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the transition rule, C1 is true (the system enforces event1 after any event2). C2 is identical, so C2 is true as well.
- C3 (C1 ⇒ C2) is therefore true. (Even more strongly: since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C1 ⇒ C2 is a tautology, so it holds regardless.)
- Because C3 holds now (and hence at some time), ""eventually C3"" is true. Even under a strict reading of ""eventually"" (requiring a future time), C3 is an invariant of the system and will hold at future times as well.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meanings and truth values of the sub-conditions
- C1 = (event2 OR event1). Since event2 happened initially, C1 is True.
- C2 = (not C1). Therefore C2 is False.
- C3 = (not C2). Therefore C3 is True (negation of False).
- C4 = (event1 OR C3). C3 is True, and in fact event1 is also guaranteed to happen, so the disjunction is True.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because C3 is True (and event1 is also True), C4 = event1 OR C3 evaluates to True.

Final answer: C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur (at some later point).
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur (at some later point).
- Together these rules force an alternation: because event1 occurred initially, event2 must occur afterwards; once event2 has occurred, event1 must occur again, and so on. So event2 must occur (at least once, and under the stated rules it will keep recurring as the alternation continues).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (read as a global claim that event2 never occurs at any time)
- C3: same as C1 (they are identical).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreting this depends on how you read C1:
  - If C1 means “event2 never occurs” (a global/always claim), then C2 means “eventually it will become true that event2 never occurs from that point onward” (i.e., from some time forward event2 never happens).
  - If C1 were instead interpreted as a local/state claim “event2 is not happening at the current instant,” then C2 would mean “at some future instant, event2 is not happening” (a much weaker claim).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Under the natural/global reading of C1 (“event2 never occurs”): C1 is false because the rules force event2 to occur after the initial event1. Therefore C3 is false. C2 is also false: you cannot reach a future point from which event2 never occurs because the alternation requires event2 to recur. So C2 is false. Hence C4 = C2 AND C3 is false.
- Under the alternate/local reading of C1 (“event2 not happening at a given instant”): C3 (same as C1) is not a global true statement (it holds only at some instants, but C3 as stated seems to be a global claim and so would not be true as a persistent fact). Even if C2 were true (there will be some instant where event2 is not happening), C3 as stated (“event2 does not happen” as a global claim) would still be false, so C4 is false.

Conclusion: In all reasonable readings consistent with the context, C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (call it time t0): event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state (t0 → t1: event1 implies event2 at t1).
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state (t1 → t2: event2 implies event1 at t2).
- Thus the system alternates: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, …

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (evaluated relative to the initial state t0)
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” — i.e. event1 at t1.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — ¬C1.
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens” — C2 ∨ (event2 at t1).
- C4: “If event2 happens, then C3 holds” — (event2 at t1) → C3.

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the transition rules, at t1 event2 does happen (t1 has event2), so C1 is false (event1 is at t2, not t1).
- Therefore C2 is true.
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2 is true (in fact both disjuncts are true: C2 true and event2 true).
- C4 is the implication (event2 → C3). Since the antecedent (event2 at t1) is true and the consequent C3 is true, the implication C4 is true. More generally, because C3 is true, the implication holds regardless of the antecedent.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Summary answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one is one in which event1 happens).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs the system has no further outgoing events).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (P → P) and is true in any state where the implication is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true (C1 holds in every state).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" This disjunction is true in any state where either event1 occurs or C2 is true. Because C2 is true everywhere, C3 is therefore true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" This asks whether C3 is true in the state immediately following the current one.

4) How they relate and final check for C4
- Because C1 is trivially true, C2 (C1 always holds) is true in all states.
- Therefore C3 (event1 happens or C2 holds) is true in all states regardless of whether event1 occurs.
- In particular, in the next state (by the transition rule after event2, that next state is one in which event1 happens), C3 is true (both because event1 happens there and because C2 holds).
- Hence C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true.

- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, it is followed by event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a proposition about the immediate next state)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (at some future point C1 is true)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" (C2 → event1)
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" (C3 ∨ event1)

4) How they relate / truth values
- Because event2 has occurred initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 never happens at any future time. Thus:
  - C1 is false (event1 does not occur in the next state).
  - C2 is false (C1 never becomes true at any future point).
  - C3 is true: an implication with a false antecedent (C2) is true (vacuously true).
  - C4 = (C3 ∨ event1) is therefore true because C3 is true (the disjunction holds regardless of event1).

Therefore C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False (under the natural reading that ""after event2 no other events can happen"" makes the state with event2 terminal — i.e. there is no next state).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the current/initial state is one in which event2 has just happened and event1 has not).

2) What are the transition rules?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"": if event1 ever occurs in some state, then at some later state event2 will occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"": once event2 has occurred the execution stops (there is no successor state in which any event occurs). I will take this to mean the state with event2 is terminal (no next state).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — a proposition about the current state (true in the initial state because event2 already happened and event1 did not).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asserts there is a next state and in that next state event1 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future state (possibly now or later) C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — at some future state C3 is true.

4) How do these relate and what follows?
- From the terminal interpretation, there is no next state after the initial state. Therefore:
  - C2 is false in the initial state (X p is false at a terminal state).
  - There are no future states to make C2 true, so ""eventually C2"" (C3) is false.
  - Consequently C4 (""eventually C3"") is also false.
- Hence C4 is False.

Note on alternate semantics: if instead ""no other events can happen"" means events stop but time steps (silent/stuttering steps) continue so that there are successor states in which nothing happens, then C2 could be true (the next state exists and still has no event1), and then C3 and C4 would become true. The conclusion above assumes the usual interpretation that ""after event2"" the trace ends (no next state).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the state where event2 has happened is terminal (no next state), so C2 (which requires a next state) is false; hence C3 (""eventually C2"") is false, and therefore C4 is false."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event2 holds.

2) Transition rules
- If event2 holds at a state, then event1 must hold in the next state (s+1).
- If event1 holds at a state, then event2 must hold in the next state.
These rules force alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e. at the current state s, event2 holds at s+1.
- C2: same as C1 (redundant).
- C3: C1 or C2 — equivalently, ""event2 holds at the next state"".
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state t ≥ current state where C3 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Timeline from s0 under the rules: s0: event2; s1: event1; s2: event2; s3: event1; ...
- At s0, the next state s1 has event1, so C1 and C2 are false at s0; thus C3 is false at s0.
- At s1, the next state s2 has event2, so C1 (and C3) is true at s1.
- Therefore from the initial state s0 there exists a future state (s1) where C3 holds, so ""C3 eventually holds"" is true.

Thus C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: The system alternates event2 (s0), event1 (s1), event2 (s2), ... C3 is ""event2 holds at the next state"", which is true at s1 (since s2 has event2). Thus from the initial state s0 there exists a future state (s1) where C3 holds, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True."

Short answer: C4 is True (under the natural reading below). Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so at least one occurrence of event1 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So once event1 has occurred, event2 will occur afterwards.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So event2 is terminal: once it occurs no further events occur.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; logically it reduces to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: identical to C1, so also reduces to ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — since both C1 and C2 are equivalent to ""event1 happens,"" C3 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" — which again reduces to ""event1 happens.""

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what is the truth of C4?
- From the initial condition we know event1 happens, so the simplified forms of C1, C2, C3, and C4 (all equivalent to ""event1 happens"") are all true.
- Also the transition rules force event2 to happen after event1 and then stop further events, but that does not invalidate that event1 did happen.

Therefore, C4 is True.

Note on ambiguity: if by the repeated phrases you meant ""event1 happens twice (two distinct occurrences),"" there is a slight ambiguity:
- If ""after event1, event2 must happen"" requires event2 immediately next (so no second event1 can occur in between), then two occurrences of event1 are impossible and C1/C2 would be false, hence C4 false.
- If ""must happen"" means ""must eventually happen"" (allowing other occurrences in between), the sequence event1, event1, event2 is possible and the previous conclusion (C4 true) still holds.

Given the plain wording and the redundant repetition in C1/C2, the intended reading is the simpler one above and C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 happens initially, no further events can occur after the initial state (so event1 cannot happen later).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is true because event2 already happened in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether, in the immediately following state, event2 will (still) eventually happen. Since event2 already occurred at the initial state and no further events can occur, event2 will not occur in any strict future state. Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.
  (If your temporal operators treat ""eventually"" as including the current state, C1 is true now but in the next state there is no occurrence of event2 at or after that next state, so C2 is still false.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false at the next state and there are no events that can change that (no further events can occur), C2 will never become true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false: C3 is false, and event1 cannot happen (nothing can happen after the initial event2). So C4 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because event2 already occurred and is terminal, C1 is true now but any formula that requires event2 to occur in some future (relative to a later state) is false. That makes C2 false, so any formula depending on C2 ever becoming true (C3) is false, and hence C4 (C3 ∨ event1) is false.

Notes on semantics: If you use a temporal semantics where ""next"" is undefined in a terminal state, Xφ may be treated as false (the common LTL convention on finite traces). Under that standard reading the above conclusions hold. If you use a nonstandard interpretation where next-state facts are handled differently, you can tell me which semantics you want and I can re-evaluate.

Summary answer: C4 is True (under the natural reading that ""happens"" means it occurs at or before the initial moment). Steps:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e., at the initial moment event2 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (event1 is terminal).

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a boolean statement true whenever either event has occurred at that moment.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some point (possibly now) C1 is true.
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" — both C2 and C3 are true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Since initially event2 has happened, C1 is true at the initial moment. (So C3, identical to C1, is also true.)
- Because C1 already holds now, ""eventually C1"" is true too, so C2 is true.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∧ C3 = True ∧ True = True.

Note/caveat: If you instead intended ""happens"" to mean ""will happen strictly in the future (not including the past/now),"" then because event2 already occurred and no further events can occur, C1 and C3 would be false and C2 false, making C4 false. The conclusion above assumes the usual interpretation that an event that has happened makes the atomic proposition true at the current time, so ""eventually"" is satisfied.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Since event2 has already happened at the initial moment, ""event2 or event1"" (C1 and C3) is true now, and therefore ""eventually (event2 or event1)"" (C2) is also true. Hence C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is True."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the initial moment (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so next relevant moment after a state with event2 has event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they alternate).
- Therefore the system produces an alternating sequence: event2 (t0), event1 (t1), event2 (t2), event1 (t3), ….

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the logical tautology (event2 → event2). It is true at any state where it is evaluated (in particular it is true at t0 because event2 happens there, and in fact as a formula a→a is always true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now (t0), it certainly holds at some future (indeed present) time — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; C2 is already true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so it also holds at some (present/future) time; hence C4 is true.

4) How they relate (chain of reasoning)
- C1 is trivially true.
- Therefore C2 (eventually C1) is true.
- Therefore C3 (C2 or event1) is true.
- Therefore C4 (eventually C3) is true.

Alternate note: Even if you interpreted ""eventually"" strictly as a future moment (not including the current instant), the alternating rule guarantees event2 and event1 occur repeatedly, so C1 and C3 will occur at some future time anyway; the conclusion C4 remains True.

Summary answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 forces a later occurrence of event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Combining these, from the initial situation the only possible sequence is: event2 (already happened) → event1 (will happen) → nothing further.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the initial condition (event2 happened), C1 is true (at least one of them has occurred).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is logically true in every case because (event1) implies (event1 or event2) is a tautology.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a tautology, it holds at every point in time; thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 holds at all times, then in particular it holds at some time — so C4 is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- C2 is a tautology, so C3 (its being always true) follows immediately.
- From C3 (always true) it follows that C4 (true at some time / eventually) holds.
- The initial event2 ensures C1 is true already, but that is not needed for the tautological steps above.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- The only events mentioned are event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (so the system is in a state after event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards. (event1 → event2)
- Rule B: After event2 happens, no other events can happen. So event2 is terminal; once the system is in a post-event2 state it does not transition to any other event.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
Treat C1–C4 as propositional/temporal statements whose truth we must evaluate in the given situation.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the implication (event1 → event1). That is a tautology (an implication with the same antecedent and consequent) and so is always true in standard logic/temporal semantics.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 asserts a false claim. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is true. Therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This is a temporal claim about C3.

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation of C4
- We have: C1 = true → C2 = false → C3 = true.
- C3 already holds in the current (initial) state. Under the usual temporal interpretation of ""eventually"" (there exists some time k ≥ 0 in the future, i.e. including the present, where the proposition holds), C3 holding now means C4 is true.
- Even if one interprets ""eventually"" as strictly in the future (k > 0), because the system is in a post-event2 terminal state and truth of these logical propositions does not change, C3 will continue to hold at all future times as well, so C4 is still true.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must happen (i.e., every occurrence of event2 is followed later by an occurrence of event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must happen (i.e., every occurrence of event1 is followed later by an occurrence of event2).

With those rules and the initial event1, the system forces an alternation: event1 (initial) → event2 (sometime later) → event1 → event2 → … so event2 will occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” Formally: F(event2). Given Rule B and initial event1, this is true.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” That is (F(event2)) ∧ (event1 occurs). Since event1 already occurred and C1 is true, C2 is true (it holds now).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Formally: F(C2). If C2 holds now, then “eventually C2” is true (eventually includes the current time in standard temporal semantics), so C3 is true. Even if you read “eventually” as “at some strictly later time,” the alternating rules guarantee C2 will hold again in the future, so C3 still becomes true.
- C4: “Event1 happens or C3 holds.” Formally: event1 ∨ C3. Since event1 has already happened, the left disjunct is true, so C4 is true (and we also have C3 true).

Step 4 — how they relate (brief chain)
- Initial event1 ⇒ by Rule B, event2 will happen ⇒ C1 true.
- event1 (initial) ∧ C1 ⇒ C2 true now.
- C2 true now ⇒ C3 true (eventually C2).
- event1 is true (initial) ⇒ C4 true (left disjunct); also C3 is true, so C4 holds either way.

Final answer
- C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: initial event1 holds. By ""after event1, event2 must happen"" event2 will occur, so C1 is true. Thus C2 (C1 ∧ event1) holds now. Therefore C3 (eventually C2) holds (either immediately under the usual F semantics which allows the current time, or later by the alternation). Since event1 holds now (and C3 also holds), C4 = event1 ∨ C3 is true."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (it is true at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — if event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterwards.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — event1 is terminal: once it has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Given the usual reading of “eventually” = “at some time (possibly already)”, this is true because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: Same as C1, so also true.
- C3: “C2 holds and event1 happens.” This is the conjunction of C2 (true) and “event1 happens” (true because it already happened), so C3 is true.
- C4: “C1 holds and C3 holds.” This is the conjunction of two true statements (C1 and C3), so C4 is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 and C2 are equivalent (both assert event1 eventually happens).
- C3 strengthens C2 only by explicitly conjoining another occurrence of “event1 happens,” but since event1 already occurred both parts are satisfied.
- C4 is just the conjunction of C1 and C3; because both are true, C4 is true.

Note on assumptions: I interpreted “event1 happened initially” as meaning event1 has indeed occurred (so any “eventually happens” claim is satisfied). If “event1 happens” in C3 were intended to mean “happens after some particular point” rather than “has happened at all,” you should state that timing requirement; under the plain reading above C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 happens.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).
(So once either event occurs, no further events occur afterwards. We assume the system either moves to a state with no events or stutters; there is no new event.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just event2 happening (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — formally (event2 → C1). Since C1 is equivalent to event2, C2 is equivalent to (event2 → event2), which is true in every state (implication is true when antecedent false, and when antecedent true the consequent is true as well).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — ◇C2. But C2 is true in every state, so C2 already holds now, therefore it certainly holds eventually.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — X C3, i.e. in the immediate successor state C3 is true.

4) How do these relate and is C4 true or false?
- Since C2 is true in every state, C3 (◇C2) is true in every state as well (it already holds now).
- In the successor state (if there is a successor state), C2 still holds there, so C3 holds there too. Therefore X C3 (C4) is true at the initial state.

Caveat: this conclusion assumes the model has a successor state (e.g., by stuttering or infinite-trace semantics). If the formal semantics you use treat ""next"" as false when there is no successor state (finite trace that ends at the initial state), then X C3 would be false because there is no next state to satisfy C3. Under the usual infinite-trace / stuttering assumption, C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step‑by‑step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (in the initial state).
- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So each event, once it has happened, forbids any further events in later states.

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event1 has happened, then in any subsequent state no other events can occur (so event2 cannot occur after event1).
- Likewise, if event2 happens, no other events occur afterwards.
- Nothing in the context says event2 happened initially; only event1 did.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: event2 happens. (The formulation ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" is just event2 happens.)
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens — i.e. both event2 and event1 have happened (both must be true).
- C3: C2 does not hold — i.e. it is not the case that both event1 and event2 happened.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state — in the immediate successor state, C3 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Since event1 happened initially and that prevents any further events, event2 cannot happen either initially (not stated) or later. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 true and event1 true; because C1 is false, C2 is false.
- Therefore C3 = not C2 is true in the initial state.
- In the next state, event2 still cannot occur (because event1 happened), so C1 remains false and C2 remains false; hence C3 remains true in the next state.
- Therefore C4 (C3 holds in the next state) is True.

Note: This conclusion assumes ""after"" refers to subsequent states (no simultaneous occurrence) and that only event1 is given to have happened initially. If the model allowed event2 to have also happened initially (simultaneously with event1), the evaluation could change, but under the stated context C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 happened initially and forbids any later events, so event2 never holds. Thus C1 and C2 are false, so C3 (=not C2) is true initially and remains true in the next state; therefore C4 is True."

I'll go step-by-step and state the assumptions I use about the temporal meaning of the phrases.

Assumption (natural reading): statements like ""Event1 always happens"" are being used to assert that event1 does occur (in the run) rather than claiming it holds at every instant of time. If you meant the stronger, ""globally at every time point,"" I’ll note that alternate conclusion at the end.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so sometime after event1, event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (under the natural reading)?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as “event1 does occur (in this run).” Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This requires C1 and that event2 occurs. Because event2 must happen after event1, C2 is true (both parts hold).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That says at some point C2 is true. Since event2 will occur, there will be a moment when C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Because C3 is true, C4 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate?
- From the context we get event1 occurs → therefore event2 will occur → thus C2 becomes true at the time event2 occurs → so C3 (""eventually C2"") is true → therefore C4 (""not C3"") is false.

Conclusion (natural reading): C4 is False.

- If instead C1 was intended to mean ""event1 holds at every moment (globally),"" then C1 would be false (it held only initially), which makes C2 false, C3 false, and then C4 true. So the truth of C4 depends on whether ""always"" was meant as “occurs” or as the temporal “always (globally).” Under the usual plain reading given your initial condition, C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 occurs initially, so event2 must occur afterward; thus C2 becomes true at that time, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true, making C4 (""C3 does not hold"") false."

Short answer: C4 is False under the usual interpretation where ""next"" requires an actual successor state. Explanation step by step.

1) What events are involved and the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happened (the initial state satisfies event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — the state where event1 has happened is terminal (no successor states / no further events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, some later state must have event1. (Given the first rule, this will only be relevant if event2 occurs before event1; here it does not.)

Because the initial state already has event1 and that state is terminal, event2 never occurs in the execution.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the formula event1 → event1. It is a propositional tautology and holds in any state where we evaluate it (true whenever the logic is classical).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the temporal Next(C1). It requires there to be a successor state and that C1 is true there.
- C3: same as C1 (so true in the current/any state).
- C4: C2 ∧ C3.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C4?
- C1 and C3 are true (tautologically).
- C2 requires a next state. But because the initial state (where event1 happened) is terminal (no next state), Next(C1) is not satisfied under the standard semantics where Next(φ) is true only if a successor state exists and φ holds there. Therefore C2 is false.
- Since C4 = C2 ∧ C3 and C2 is false, C4 is false.

Note on semantics: If you adopt a nonstandard ""weak next"" semantics that treats Next(φ) as vacuously true at terminal states, then C2 (and thus C4) could be considered true. Under the usual temporal-logical reading where ""next"" requires a real successor, C4 is False.

Summary answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (from the context)
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened, the system is terminal — no further events occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Likewise, event2 would also be terminal if it ever occurred.

Because event1 has already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state and no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is logically equivalent to simply ""event2 happens"" (a conjunction of the same proposition).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" In temporal logic terms: globally/at all times C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" That is, it is not true that C1 holds at all times.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That is, at some time (including possibly the current moment), C3 is true.

(Clarification: standard temporal operators assume ""eventually"" includes the current state as a valid witness.)

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Since event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 never happens. Therefore C1 is false.
- If C1 is false, then ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
- C3 states that C2 does not hold; because C2 is false, C3 is true immediately (at the initial state).
- Because C3 holds now, ""eventually C3"" (C4) is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (initially) event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted here as “event1 occurs (now or at some time in the execution)” or stronger “event1 will occur” — in any case it asserts event1 does occur.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This is the conjunction: event1 happens AND C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" At some future point (perhaps now) C2 becomes true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Negation of C3.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because initially event2 has already happened and event2 is terminal, no further events can ever occur after the start. Therefore event1 cannot happen (there is no opportunity for it).
- If event1 does not happen, C1 is false (it asserts that event1 happens). Then C2 (which requires event1 and C1) is false.
- If C2 is false now and no future events can make it true, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- Therefore C4, the statement ""C3 does not hold"", is true.

Note: this conclusion assumes the usual temporal reading that ""initially event2 happened"" places us after event2 with no prior pending events, and that ""after event2 no other events can happen"" forbids any later occurrence of event1. If you meant a different temporal interpretation (e.g., allowing event1 to have occurred before the initial point), please specify and I can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: initially event2 has already happened and is terminal, so event1 cannot occur now or later; therefore C1 and C2 are false, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false, and so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (This is exactly C1.)
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen.
These rules create an alternating loop: event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the same as Rule A and therefore holds (true) by the problem statement.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 did happen initially, C2 is true (at least at the initial time).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" That asserts C3 is true at all times. But C3 is false (it does not hold), so C4 is false.

4) How they relate (brief)
- C1 → C2 (given event2 occurred) so C2 is true.
- C3 = ¬C2, so C3 is false.
- C4 asserts C3 is always true, but since C3 is already false, C4 cannot be true.

Therefore C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 is true and event2 occurred, so C2 is true. C3 is ¬C2, so C3 is false; hence ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
So as soon as event2 has happened, the run is finished and event1 cannot occur later.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (interpreting ""always"" as: in the actual run starting from the given initial condition, event1 occurs — or more strictly, in all executions from the initial condition event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. the statement C1 is true).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" (implication: event2 → C2).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (the negation of C3).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because the system starts with event2 and event2 is terminal, event1 cannot occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (which asserts C1) is false.
- C3 is the implication (event2 → C2). The antecedent (event2) is true in the actual run, and the consequent C2 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C3 does not hold.
- C4 states that C3 does not hold. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

(If you intended a different formal reading of ""always"" or of the modal scope of these statements, mention that and I can re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 has happened initially and is terminal, so event1 cannot occur ⇒ C1 is false ⇒ C2 (which asserts C1) is false. Since event2 is true and C2 is false, the implication C3 (event2 → C2) is false, so its negation C4 is true."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 holds.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: whenever event2 holds at some state, event1 holds at the next state. (Formally: G(event2 -> X event1).)
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: whenever event1 holds at some state, event2 holds at the next state. (Formally: G(event1 -> X event2).)
- From the initial condition and these rules we get an alternating sequence: time0: event1, time1: event2, time2: event1, time3: event2, ….

3) Meaning of C1–C4 (standard statewise reading)
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" — interpreted as (event2 ∧ event1) holding at the current state.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — the formula (C1 -> event2). But (event2 ∧ event1) -> event2 is a logical tautology (if A and B then A).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — X(C2). Since C2 is a tautology (true in every state), it certainly holds in the next state.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — i.e. X(C2) ∨ event1.

4) How they relate / final truth value
- Because C2 is always true (tautology), C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true.
- Therefore C4 = (C3 ∨ event1) is true (true ∨ anything = true).

Caveat: this answer assumes the usual statewise semantics (each Ci is a formula evaluated at a state). If you instead meant C1 as a global/existential claim like ""there exists some time where both happen"" the analysis would change; under the most natural reading above, C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happened (i.e. event1 holds now).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (when event2 occurs, the next state must have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Concretely: if event1 holds in a state, there is no following state in which any event holds (equivalently, there is no successor state with an event).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the tautology p → p. It holds in any state where the formula is interpreted (C1 is always true).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 reduces to: event1 holds in the current state. So C2 is true exactly in states where event1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This is a next-time condition: C3 is true in a state only if there is a successor state and C2 is true there (i.e. the successor state has event1).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This requires C3 to be true in every state (globally).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- C1 is true everywhere.
- C2 is true exactly in states that have event1. In the initial state C2 is true (because event1 holds initially).
- But because after event1 no other events can happen, there is no successor state where event1 holds. So in the initial state the next-state requirement C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") fails (there is no next state with C2 true).
- Since C3 is false in (at least) the initial state, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Therefore C4 is False. (If you adopt a different semantic convention about ""next"" in terminating states — e.g. treating Xφ as undefined or true — you would need that convention to make C3 true; under the usual LTL treatment of finite traces, Xφ is false when there is no successor, so the conclusion above applies.)

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 (event1 → event1) is a tautology, so it holds at all times.
- C2 says ""if C1 holds then event2 happens."" Since C1 always holds, C2 would require event2 to happen at all times.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start of the trace).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (event2 is required after any event1).
- Rule B: After event2 happens, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 already happened initially and rule B forbids any events after event2, no new event (including event1) can occur after the initial moment.

3) What the Ci mean
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" — requires both events to occur at some times in the trace.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — requires C1 plus another occurrence of event1 (so even stronger).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some later point C2 becomes true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" — a disjunction: true if either C3 is true or event2 happens.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition we know event2 happens is true.
- Because event2 has already happened and no events can occur afterward, there is no possibility of new occurrences of event1 after the initial state. Unless additional unstated past history tells us event1 already happened before the initial condition, we cannot conclude event1 happens. So C1 is not guaranteed (false under the usual reading that only the given initial event occurred). Hence C2 and C3 are also not satisfied in the future (they cannot become true after the initial event2).
- Regardless of C3, C4 = (C3) OR (event2 happens). Since event2 does happen (initially), the disjunction is true.

Therefore C4 is True. (Note: even in the corner case where event1 did happen earlier, making C1–C3 possibly true, C4 would still be true because event2 happens.)

Short answer: C4 is True (under the usual semantics below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the initial state s0 we have event2 true and event1 false).
- Additional global facts: after event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. So both events lead to terminal states (s0 has no successor).

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs, the state is terminal (no successor).
- If event2 occurs, the state is terminal (no successor).
- In particular, the initial state s0 (where event2 holds) has no ""next"" state.

3) What each C means (interpreting Next as the usual temporal ""next"" operator and implications as material implication)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Treat as a proposition that is true iff event1 holds in every state. At s0 this is false because event1 does not hold at s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = Next(C1). At s0 this is false because there is no next state (standard Next is false at terminal states).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" = (C2 -> event1). With C2 false at s0, the implication is true (material implication is true when antecedent is false).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" = (C3 -> event2).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- At s0: event2 = true, event1 = false.
- C1 = false.
- C2 = false (no successor).
- C3 = true (false -> event1 is true).
- C4 = (C3 -> event2) = (true -> event2) = event2, which is true at s0.

Therefore C4 is true under the standard assumptions above.

Note: If you use nonstandard semantics (e.g., Next is treated as vacuously true at dead-ends, or implications are not material), the truth value could differ. The answer above follows the usual linear-time temporal-logic/material-implication conventions.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no other event can happen afterwards — in particular, event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 cannot actually occur given Rule A and the initial event1.)

From Rule A plus the initial event1 we conclude: event2 does not happen. Call this fact: e2 = False.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Formally C1 = (not e2).
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” Formally C2 = (C1 and e2) = (not e2 and e2). This is a contradiction, so C2 is always False.
- C3: “If event2 happens, then C2 holds.” Formally C3 = (e2 -> C2). Since C2 is false, C3 is equivalent to (e2 -> False), which is logically equivalent to (not e2). So C3 is true exactly when event2 does not happen.
- C4: “C3 holds or event2 happens.” Formally C4 = (C3 or e2).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the scenario we determined e2 = False.
- C1 = not e2 = True.
- C2 = not e2 and e2 = False.
- C3 = (e2 -> C2) = (since e2 is False, implication is vacuously True) = True.
- C4 = C3 or e2 = True or False = True.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition (from the context): event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 happens after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the sequence stops after event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: same as C1 (event2 ∧ event1).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" i.e. (C2 ∨ event1). Substituting C2 gives ((event2 ∧ event1) ∨ event1).
  - Note the logical simplification: (event2 ∧ event1) ∨ event1 = event1 (because (A ∧ B) ∨ B ≡ B).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" i.e. (C1 ⇒ C3).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since C2 ≡ C1, C3 is (C1 ∨ event1) which simplifies to event1.
- C4 is therefore: (event2 ∧ event1) ⇒ event1. This is a logical tautology (p ∧ q ⇒ q is always true).
- In the given context both event2 and event1 do indeed happen, so antecedent and consequent are true; but even without using the context, the implication is valid by logic.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (in the current state).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the state(s) following the state where event1 occurred, event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (i.e. immediately after the initial state)
- C2: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (same as C1)
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens.” (a disjunction: either event1 happens next, or event2 happens)
- C4: “If C1 holds, then C3 holds.” (implication: C1 ⇒ C3)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth-values
- From the transition rules, the next state after the initial state contains event2 (because after event1 must come event2). Thus event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false. C2 is the same statement, so C2 is false.
- C3 is “C2 or event2.” Since event2 does happen after event1, C3 is true (the disjunction is true regardless of C2).
- C4 is the implication “If C1 then C3.” There are two independent ways to see that C4 is true:
  1. Vacuous truth: C1 is false, and an implication with a false antecedent is true.
  2. Structural: C1 and C2 are identical, so if C1 were true then C2 would be true, hence C3 (C2 or event2) would be true. Either way C1 ⇒ C3 holds.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after each event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after each event2).
From these two rules and the initial event1, the execution forces alternation: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, … So event2 occurs repeatedly (infinitely often), but not at the same time as event1.

3) What each Ci means
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (same text as C2)
- C2: “Event2 always happens.”
  Note: C1 and C2 are identical statements as written.
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds” — formally C1 ⇒ C2.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” — i.e., at some point (or from some point onward) the statement C3 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C3 is the implication p ⇒ p, which is a tautology (always true). So C3 holds immediately (from the start).
- Therefore C3 certainly “eventually holds” (it holds now), so C4 is True.

Minor note on ambiguity: if by “always happens” you meant something different (for example, “occurs at every time instant” vs “occurs infinitely often” vs “occurs at least once”), the truth of C1/C2 may differ, but that does not change the answer about C3 and C4 here because C3 is an implication between two identical statements and so is true regardless; hence C4 remains True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 and C2 are the same proposition, so C3 (C1 ⇒ C2) is the tautology p ⇒ p and holds immediately; therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it occurs first).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the sequence is event2 → event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the sequence ends at event1).

Thus in any allowed run: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is a conjunctive repetition of the same proposition. Interpreted in standard propositional logic, C1 ≡ (event2) — the conjunction of identical literals is equivalent to the single literal.
  (If one insisted C1 meant “event2 happens twice at different times,” that would be a different reading; I address that below.)
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ event2.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally C3 is C1 → C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C3 is of the form P → P.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This asserts that the implication C1 → C2 is true (and invariantly true).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because C1 and C2 are identical propositions, C3 is a tautology (P → P) and therefore true in every possible situation.
- Therefore C3 does indeed always hold, so C4 is True.

Note on the alternative reading (if the repetition in C1/C2 was intended to mean two distinct occurrences of event2): Under the given transition rules, event2 happens only once (it is followed by event1 and then no further events), so a reading meaning “event2 occurs twice” would make C1 and C2 false. Even then C3 (false → false) is true, and so C4 (that C3 always holds) remains true. In all reasonable interpretations C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This implies event1 will eventually occur.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This just says event1 is terminal.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (call this E1)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e. ¬E1
- C3: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1, i.e. E1)
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" i.e. (¬E1) ∨ E1

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", we conclude E1 is true, so C1 = True.
- Therefore C2 = ¬E1 = False.
- C3 = E1 = True.
- C4 = (¬E1) ∨ E1. In classical logic this is the law of excluded middle and is always true; here since C3 is true, C4 is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

Reasoning (concise):
- Let q = ""event2 happens"". Then C1 ≡ q, C2 ≡ G q (q always), C3 ≡ X(C2) (C2 holds in the next state), C4 ≡ G X(C2).
- From the scenario: s0 (initial) has event1 and not q; s1 has q; after s1 no further events occur (so q does not hold forever).
- C1 (q) is false in s0, true in s1, false afterward. Thus C2 (G q) is false (q is not true in all states).

Short answer: C4 is True (under the usual infinite-trace / LTL-style interpretation). I'll show why and also note the alternative finite-trace caveat.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 happened (so at time 0 the proposition event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 no other events can happen: once event1 holds, event2 cannot occur later; event1 persists (or at least nothing else can change it).
- After event2, event1 must happen: if event2 ever occurs then event1 must hold afterwards. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 will not occur given the first rule.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" = F(event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = F(event2) ∨ event1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = X(C2).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" = G(C3).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because event1 holds initially and no other events can happen after event1, event1 holds at every subsequent time and event2 never occurs. So:
  - C1 = F(event2) is false (event2 never happens).
  - C2 = F(event2) ∨ event1 is true (since event1 is true).
  - C3 = X(C2) is true in the initial state because in the next state event1 still holds, so C2 holds there.
  - The same reasoning applies at every state (event1 persists, C2 true in the next state), so C3 holds in every state, hence C4 = G(C3) is true.

Caveat: If you use a finite-trace semantics where the final/terminal state has no ""next"" state and X(·) is considered false (or undefined) at the last state, then C3 would fail at that terminal moment and C4 would be false. Under the standard infinite-trace LTL view (or if the terminal state is modeled by a self-loop so ""next"" exists and event1 continues to hold), C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False (under the usual reading that “next” requires an actual successor state). Below are the steps and reasoning.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.
- Extra facts: “after event1, no other events can happen” and “after event2, no other events can happen.”

Because event1 already occurred initially, no further events can occur from that point onward.

2) Transition rules between events
- If a state has event1, then there are no transitions that produce any later (different) event; similarly for event2.
- Starting from the initial state (which already has event1), there are therefore no transitions that produce any new events after the initial state.

(Depending on model semantics this can be understood as either a dead-end state with no successor, or as a state that persists forever with no further events. The usual intended reading for “no other events can happen” is that no eventful transitions occur after that point.)

3) What each sub-condition means and its truth value
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Given the initial event1 and the rule that no events can happen after event1, event2 never occurs. So C1 is True.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” “Eventually” can be satisfied immediately; since C1 is already true in the initial state, C2 is True.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” This requires there to be a next state and C2 to be true there. Under the standard reading where the initial state with event1 has no successor (no further eventful transition), there is no “next” state, so the “next” formula is not satisfied — C3 is False. (If instead one models the system as eternally stuttering in the same state so a next state exists and looks the same, then C3 would be True; see the caveat below.)
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” Since C3 is never true (no successor where C2 holds in the next state), C4 is False.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- C1 true ⇒ C2 true (immediately).
- But because there is no next state after the initial state, C3 is false, and therefore there is no future state in which C3 becomes true. Thus C4 (eventually C3) is False.

Caveat / alternative semantics
- If you adopt a semantics where the system has an infinite sequence of states (stuttering) and the same state repeats forever after event1, then a “next” state exists and looks identical to the initial one; in that model C3 would be True and thus C4 True. The conclusion above assumes the more common “no successor” reading, which makes C4 False.

Short answer: C4 is True (under the usual assumption that “next” is always defined or that states after the initial one exist). Explanation below.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, later states contain no events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must subsequently occur).

(These rules constrain which event sequences are possible but do not affect the logical form of the formulas below.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” Formally: event2 → event2. This is a propositional tautology (p → p) and is true in every state, whether or not event2 actually occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That is, in the current state we assert X C1 (next C1). C2 is true at a state whenever C1 is true in the immediate successor state.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Equivalently X X C1 (C1 holds two steps ahead).
- C4: “C3 always holds.” Equivalently G (X X C1) — at every state, C1 holds two steps ahead.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C4?
- Since C1 is a tautology (true in every state), C1 is true in every successor and every further successor. Therefore C2 (next C1) is true in every state, and C3 (next next C1) is true in every state.
- Because C3 holds at every state, C4 (always C3) is true.

Caveat about semantics: If your temporal “next” operator is partial (i.e., there are terminal states with no successor and “next φ” is treated as false or undefined there), then whether C2/C3/C4 hold can depend on how you treat next at the end of finite traces. Under the usual LTL semantics on infinite traces (or if you interpret “after event1 no other events can happen” as still having successor states with no events), the argument above applies and C4 is true.

I'll answer step by step, making the natural assumption that ""after X"" means ""in the next state"" (discrete time steps).

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0), event2 happened (so event2 is true in s0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpreted as: if event1 is true in some state, then event2 is true in the next state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — interpreted as: if event2 is true in some state, then event1 is true in the next state.
- With these rules and s0 having event2, the states alternate:
  - s0: event2 true
  - s1: event1 true (because after event2)
  - s2: event2 true
  - s3: event1 true
  - … and so on.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to just ""event1 happens"" (p ∧ p ≡ p).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Written: event1 → C1. Since C1 ≡ event1, this is event1 → event1, which is a tautology (always true in any state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So C3 is true in a state iff C2 is true in the following state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" So C4 is true in a state iff C3 is true in the following state (equivalently, iff C2 is true two states ahead).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C4 true or false?
- C2 is a tautology (true in every state), because it reduces to event1 → event1.
- Therefore C2 is true in every state, including all future states.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true in every state (since C2 is true in the next state).
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state) is therefore also true in every state (since C3 is true in the next state).
- Concretely with the alternating timeline from s0: C2 is true in s1 and s2, so C3 is true in s0 and s1, hence C4 (which asks about C3 in the next state) is true in s0.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. So the sequence will include event2 after event1.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — what each sub-condition means
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the tautological implication p → p, which is always true.
- C2: same as C1 — also the tautology p → p, always true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Since C2 is true regardless, the implication (event1 → C2) is true. (Also event1 did happen, but that is not needed to establish the implication’s truth because C2 is already true.)
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" This is true if at least one of C1 or C3 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 is true (tautology). C2 is true (tautology), hence C3 is true as well. Therefore C4 (C1 or C3) is true. In fact C1 alone already guarantees C4 is true.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happened (so event1 holds initially, event2 does not hold initially).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Interpretation: whenever a state has event1, the next state has event2; whenever a state has event2, the next state has event1. This enforces strict alternation of the two events (possibly with each occurring in successive states).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — a state formula ¬event2 (true exactly in states where event2 is false).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — ◇C1: from the current state there is some future state where ¬event2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — □(◇C1): at every state along the run, there will eventually be a state with ¬event2.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — X(□◇C1): in the immediate next state, it is true that at every state from there on, eventually ¬event2 will occur.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because of alternation, there are infinitely many states with ¬event2 (the states where event1 holds). Thus from any given state there is always some future state with ¬event2, so ◇C1 holds at every state. That means C2 is true at every state, hence C3 (□C2) is true now.
- If C3 is true now, it is certainly true in the next state as well (it is a property holding at every state). Therefore X C3 (C4) is true.

Therefore C4 is True (under the standard reading of ""after"" as next-state or ""eventually"" with guaranteed alternation — either yields the same conclusion that ¬event2 occurs infinitely often).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: The rules force strict alternation, so ¬event2 holds in infinitely many states (whenever event1 holds). Hence from every state ◇¬event2 is true, so □◇¬event2 holds everywhere — in particular it holds in the next state, so X□◇¬event2 (C4) is true."

Short answer: C4 is True (given the usual interpretation of ""next"" in temporal/logical talk).

Step-by-step answer to your four questions

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.
- Extra facts: after event1, no other events can happen (the state reached after event1 is terminal). Also, if event2 happens it would also be terminal, but event2 does not happen initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- From the initial situation event1 occurs and the system moves to a state with no successors (no next state).
- There are no transitions out of a state that has had event1 (and likewise none out of a state that has had event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — read as a global/“always” claim (for every state reached, event1 holds). In our model there is only the initial state and event1 holds there, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the usual next operator X C1. This requires a next state and that C1 is true there. But there is no next state (after event1 no other events can happen), so X C1 is false under the standard semantics that treats ""next"" as false when no successor exists.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" — the implication C3 → event1.

4) How do these conditions relate; is C4 true or false?
- Evaluate the implication in the initial state: antecedent C3 is true (we just saw C2 is false), consequent ""event1 happens"" is also true (event1 did happen initially). A material implication with true antecedent and true consequent is true. So C4 is true in the initial state.
- There are no other reachable states to check, so C4 is true in the model.

Caveat: If you adopt a nonstandard semantics for ""next"" (for example, treating next as undefined rather than false when there is no successor), the truth values may need a different treatment. Under the standard interpretation used above, C4 is True.

Brief statement of assumptions I’ll use (they’re the natural reading of the text):
- Discrete states s0, s1, s2, … with “next state” meaning the immediate successor.
- “Initially, event2 happened” means event2 is true in s0.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” means: whenever event2 holds in some state, event1 holds in the immediately following state.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means: if event1 holds in a state, then no events hold in any later state (in particular the next state has no events).

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in s0 event2 is true (event2 happened initially).

2) Transition rules between events
- If event2 holds in a state, then event1 holds in the very next state.
- If event1 holds in a state, then no events hold in any later state (the next state and onward have no events).

3) What each sub-condition means (evaluated at s0 unless stated)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — i.e. event2 holds in s1.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens” — i.e. (event2 in s1) AND (event1 holds in the same state being considered — here, s0 unless otherwise indicated).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — i.e. C2 is true in s1.
- C4: “Event2 happens or C3 holds” — i.e. (event2 holds in the current state) OR (C3 is true).

4) How the conditions relate and final truth value
- From the rules and s0:
  - s0: event2 is true (by initial condition).
  - By “after event2, event1 must happen”, s1: event1 is true.
  - By “after event1 no other events can happen”, s2 and later: no events.
- Evaluate Cs at s0:
  - C1 (event2 in s1)? No — s1 has event1, not event2. So C1 = false.
  - C2 = C1 AND event1 (at s0). Because C1 is false, C2 = false.
  - C3 = (C2 true in s1)? C2 is false, so C3 = false.
  - C4 = (event2 at s0) OR C3. event2 is true at s0, so C4 = true.

So C4 is True under the natural reading (evaluating the conditions at the initial state). Note: if you instead evaluate all formulas at s1 (or change the intended temporal references), truth values can differ — but with the usual interpretation above, C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: At the initial state s0 event2 holds, so C4 = (event2 at s0) OR C3 is true regardless of C3. Thus C4 is True."

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the current (initial) state s0, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After any state where event1 occurs, the next state must have event2.
- After any state where event2 occurs, the next state must have event1.
- Hence the system produces an infinite alternation: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, …

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — formally: at the current state, the immediate successor state has event2. (X event2 in temporal logic.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state at which C1 is true. (F C1.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — F C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — F C3.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- At s0, C1 is true because s1 has event2 (by the transition rule and the given initial event1).
- If C1 is true at the current state then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true (it already holds now).
- If C2 is true now then C3 = ""eventually C2"" is true (again it already holds now).
- By the same reasoning C4 = ""eventually C3"" is true.

Thus C1 is true at the initial state, and therefore C2, C3, and C4 are all true.

Short answer: C4 is False (under the natural reading that ""after event1 no other events can happen"" makes the run terminal). Below are the step‑by‑step answers.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward.
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (Natural reading: once event1 has occurred the system produces no further events — the run is terminal.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the same as saying event1 holds in the current state (tautologically the same disjunct twice).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event1 holds in the immediate successor state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event1 holds two steps ahead.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state (maybe the same or later) where C3 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C4?
- At the initial state C1 is true because event1 happened initially.
- By Rule B, after event1 no further events occur; the run is terminal. In standard temporal semantics, a ""next"" formula (X φ) evaluated at a state with no successor is false. Therefore:
  - C2 = ""next C1"" is false (no successor state where event1 could hold).
  - C3 = next C2 is also false.
  - C4 = ""eventually C3"" is false because there are no future states in which C3 holds.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

Note on an alternative interpretation: if one instead reads ""after event1 no other events can happen"" to mean ""no events other than event1 can occur afterward"" (so event1 could repeat forever), then the run could have infinite repetitions of event1, making C2, C3 true and thus C4 true. The answer above uses the more common reading that event1 makes the run terminal.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Justification: event1 occurs initially and by the given rule the run is terminal, so there is no successor state where C2 (next C1) can hold; hence C3 never holds and C4 (eventually C3) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (current state s0): event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (if E1 holds in some state, then E2 holds in the next state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if E2 holds in some state, then E1 holds in the next state).
So starting from s0 with E2, the states must alternate: s0: E2, s1: E1, s2: E2, s3: E1, …

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” — i.e. X E1 evaluated at s0.
- C2: “If event1 happens (now), then C1 holds” — i.e. (E1 → X E1) evaluated at s0.
- C3: “Event2 happens (now) or C2 holds” — i.e. E2 ∨ (E1 → X E1) at s0.
- C4: “Event2 happens (now) or C3 holds” — i.e. E2 ∨ C3 at s0.

Note algebraically: C3 = E2 ∨ C2, so C4 = E2 ∨ C3 = E2 ∨ (E2 ∨ C2) = E2 ∨ C2. Hence C4 is logically equivalent to C3.

Step 4 — truth values and relation
- At s0, E2 is true by the initial condition.
- From the transition rules, at s1 E1 holds, so C1 (X E1) is true.
- C2 is the implication (E1 → X E1). At s0 E1 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously). (Also C1 is in fact true, so the implication would be satisfied even if E1 were true in another context.)
- C3 = E2 ∨ C2 is true because E2 is true at s0 (and C2 is true too).
- C4 = E2 ∨ C3 is therefore true (and, as noted, C4 ≡ C3).

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This is the implication event2 ⇒ event1.

- C1 is given by the context, so C1 = True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (this is given as true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).  
Thus the only possible sequence, given the initial condition and rules, is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, and then nothing else.

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3, C4 (and their truth values under the above)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction of the same fact, so C1 ≡ ""event1 happens"". Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is C2 ≡ ¬C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Formally: event2 → C2. But event2 does happen (by the rule after event1), and C2 is false, so the implication event2 → C2 is false (true antecedent, false consequent). Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This asserts that C3 is true (at all relevant times). Since C3 is false in the actual execution (when event2 happens), C4 is false.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event1 happens, C1 is true and hence C2 (its negation) is false.
- Because event2 happens and C2 is false, the implication in C3 fails, so C3 is false.
- C4 claims C3 always holds, but C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the trace has no further events).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, an event1 must follow).

Given the initial condition (event1 happened at the start) and Rule A, no further events can ever occur in the trace. In particular, event2 can never occur.

3) What each sub-condition means (reading them as standard temporal/logical statements):
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as a global property that event2 holds at all times (or at least that event2 occurs in the relevant sense); in any case this is the statement that event2 does occur (persistently).
- C2: C1 does not hold = not C1.
- C3: C2 eventually holds = at some time in the future (possibly now) not C1 is true.
- C4: C3 always holds = at every timepoint, eventually not C1 holds (i.e., ""always eventually not C1"").

4) How they relate given the rules:
- Because event1 occurred initially and Rule A forbids any further events, event2 never occurs. So C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (not C1) is true, and in fact true at the initial time and thereafter.
- C3 (""eventually C2"") holds (it already holds immediately).
- C4 (""always C3"") requires that at every timepoint there is some future time at which C2 holds. Since C2 holds at every timepoint, that requirement is satisfied. Thus C4 is true.

Minor note: if you intended a different reading of ""C1: Event2 always happens"" (for example, meaning ""event2 eventually happens at least once""), make that explicit—then the truth values could change. Under the standard reading above, C4 is True.

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (so event1 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (so there will be a later point where event2 is true).
- After event2 happens no other events can happen (so the sequence is: event1 happens, then event2 happens, then nothing further).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just event1 (the conjunction is redundant). So C1 is true (because event1 happens initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — with C1 ≡ event1, C2 ≡ (event1) OR (event2).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this asserts that at every relevant point C2 is true. Check the timeline: at the initial point event1 is true so C2 is true; later event2 is true so C2 is true there as well. There is no state in which both event1 and event2 are false, so C2 is indeed always true. Therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"" — this is event1 OR C3.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Since C3 is true (from the previous step), the disjunction in C4 (event1 OR C3) is true regardless of event1. Therefore C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 reduces to ""event1 happens"", which is given true initially. C4 is ""event1 happens or C3 holds"", so because event1 happens, the disjunction is true regardless of C3. (Even if there's ambiguity about the meaning of ""always"" for C3, that doesn't affect C4.)"

Short answer: C4 is True (when evaluated at the initial state).

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time/state t0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — if event1 occurs at some state t, then event2 occurs at the next state t+1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs at state t, then event1 occurs at t+1.
- From the initial event2 at t0, the rules force an alternation: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

3) Meaning of C1, C2, C3, C4
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as: at every state, event2 holds (a global/invariant claim).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — i.e. (C1) OR (event2 holds now).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. NOT C2 (at the state where C3 is evaluated).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at the next state t+1, C3 is true.

4) How they relate (evaluate at the initial state t0)
- At t0: event2 is true (given). C1 is false (event2 is not true at every state, e.g. at t1 event2 is false), but C2 = C1 OR event2 = false OR true = true. Hence C3 = NOT C2 = false at t0.
- At t1 (the next state): by the alternation, event1 holds and event2 does not. C1 is still false; event2 is false, so C2 = false OR false = false. Therefore C3 = NOT C2 = true at t1.
- C4 asserts that C3 holds in the next state (i.e. that C3 is true at t1). We found C3 is indeed true at t1.

Therefore C4 is true (when evaluated at the initial state t0).

- Events: Event1 and Event2.
- Initial condition: Event2 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After Event1 occurs, Event2 must occur.
- After Event2 occurs, Event1 must occur.
So the system forces alternation. Starting from the initial Event2, the next event must be Event1, then Event2, etc.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e. Event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" (Event2 occurs AND Event1 never occurs).
- C3: same as C1 (Event1 does not happen).
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" (either C2 is true or C3 is true).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial Event2 and the rule ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"", Event1 does occur. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 = (Event2 happens) AND C1. Event2 does happen initially (true) but C1 is false, so C2 is false (true AND false → false).
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is false.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- These rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (no step with neither event).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (At a given step, at least one of the two events occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true at every step/time.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (Negation of C2.)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (Negation of C3 — i.e., double negation of C2.)

4) How they relate / truth evaluation
- From the alternating rule, at every step one of the two events occurs, so C1 is true at every step.
- Therefore C2 is true.
- C3 is the claim that C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 is the claim that C3 is false; since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Assumptions: events are instantaneous occurrences and the transition rules are strict (no step with neither event). Under those assumptions C4 is True. If you allow a possibility that neither event ever occurs at some step (contradicting the given transitions), the conclusion could change — but with the given rules, C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (we start in a state after event1).

2) Transition rules
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” => once event1 has happened, there are no further transitions that produce any events.
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” => likewise, if event2 happens then nothing happens afterward.
- Because event1 already happened initially, the “after event1” rule applies immediately: there are no future events from the initial state.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” This asserts that in the immediate next state event1 occurs.
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds.” A conjunction: event2 happens in that next state and C1 is true.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” There exists some future state (possibly the next one) where C2 is true.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” The negation of C3.

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the transition rule, after the initial event1 no events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen again in the next state, so C1 is false.
- If C1 is false then C2 (C1 ∧ event2) is false regardless; additionally event2 cannot occur after event1, so event2 is false as well.
- Because C2 is never true in any future state, C3 (“C2 eventually holds”) is false.
- C4 is the negation of C3, so C4 is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True (because C3 is false).

Short answer: C4 is False (under the standard instantaneous-event / state-based reading). Below is the step-by-step reasoning and the alternative interpretation note.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 has happened (i.e. event2 occurs at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur later (if event1 ever happens then event2 must follow).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: once it occurs, the future has no further events).

From these rules and the initial condition: event2 occurs at the initial state, and because event2 is terminal, no events (including event1) can occur at any later state. So event1 never occurs on the timeline.

3) What each condition means and their truth values
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens.” Under the timeline above, event2 happens but event1 never does → C1 is False.
- C2: “Event2 happens or C1 holds.” At the initial state this is True (event2 happens). At any later state, event2 does not occur (no events occur) and C1 is False, so C2 is False at later states. So C2 is not true at all states.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” Because C2 fails at later states, C3 is False.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” C3 is False in the next state (indeed false everywhere), so C4 is False.

4) How they relate
- C2 is initially true only because event2 occurs initially.
- That temporary truth of C2 is not enough to make C2 true “always,” so C3 fails.
- Since C3 fails, it certainly does not hold in the next state, so C4 is False.

Alternative interpretation note
- If “eventX happens” were interpreted as “eventX has happened at some point in the past or present” (a persistent past predicate), then because event2 has already happened, C2 would be true at every state, C3 true, and C4 would be True. But with the usual instantaneous/state-based reading (events are true only in the state where they occur), C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is True (vacuously). Explanation below, step by step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After any event1, event2 must happen next.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next.
So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (standard temporal/read-on-current-time reading)
- Let p mean “event2 happens (at the current time).”
- C1: “event2 happens and event2 happens” ≡ p (the repeated conjunct is redundant).
- C2: “C1 always holds” ≡ G p (p holds at every time).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds” ≡ F (G p) (there is a time after which p holds at all future times).
- C4: “If C3 holds, then event2 happens” ≡ (F (G p)) → p.

4) How they relate, and truth values given the alternating sequence
- p is true at times when event2 occurs and false at times when event1 occurs. So p is true at every other time, not at all times.
- C1 (p) is sometimes true (whenever event2 occurs) and sometimes false (whenever event1 occurs).
- C2 (G p) is false: p is not true at every time.
- C3 (F (G p)) is false: there is no time after which p holds forever (the alternation continues forever), so “eventually p always” never becomes true.
- C4, the implication (F (G p)) → p, has a false antecedent (C3 is false). An implication with false antecedent is true, so C4 is true (vacuous truth). In fact C4 holds at every time in this scenario.

Note/caveat: If you intended different semantics for “happens” (e.g., “event2 happens at some time in the future” rather than “happens now”), the labels map differently, but under the standard current-time temporal interpretation above the conclusion (C4 is True) stands.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Detailed step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state s0, event2 occurred.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event1 occurs sometime after event2; taking the ordinary reading that it happens at the next state is sufficient for the argument).

A possible (and simplest) timeline consistent with these rules:
- s0: event2 happens.
- s1: event1 happens (required after event2).
- s2 and onward: no events (because event1 forbids any further events).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e. event2 holds at every state (G event2). In our timeline this is false because event2 holds at s0 but not at s1 or s2.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — formally (C1 → event2). Since C1 is false in the run, the implication C1 → event2 is vacuously true at every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X(C2): C2 must be true at the next state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X(C3): C3 must be true at the next state (equivalently C2 must be true two steps ahead).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- C1 is false (event2 does not hold in every state because s1, s2,... don't have event2).
- Therefore C2 = (C1 → event2) is true everywhere (implication with false antecedent).
- Because C2 is true at s1 and s2, C3 = X C2 is true at s0, and C4 = X C3 is true at s0 as well.

Thus C4 is True. (This conclusion does not depend on interpreting ""after event2, event1 must happen"" as immediate next or ""eventually"" — in either case C1 is false and C2 is vacuously true, so C3 and C4 hold.)

Step 1 — What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is true that event2 occurred at the start).

Step 2 — What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event2 → event1 (if event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards).
- After event1, no other events can happen. So event1 is terminal; once event1 happens, the sequence ends.

From these rules and the initial condition, the actual sequence is: event2 happens, then event1 happens, then nothing else.

Step 3 — What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the initial condition, C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1) so C2 is also false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" That is ¬C2. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" That is the implication C1 → C3.

Step 4 — How do these conditions relate, and is C4 true or false?
- We have C1 = false, C2 = false, C3 = true.
- The implication C1 → C3 is true whenever the antecedent C1 is false (material implication is vacuously true), and here C3 is actually true as well. Therefore C4 is true.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just redundant wording for ""event1 happens."" So C1 is true iff event1 happens at some relevant time. In our situation event1 did not happen (event2 happened initially and prevents other events), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that C1 is true at all times. Since C1 is already false (now), C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is the implication (event2) → (C2). Since event2 did happen (antecedent true) but C2 is false (consequent false), the implication is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

4) How they relate / conclusion
- Because event2 happened initially and prevents any occurrence of event1, C1 is false, so C2 is false. That makes the implication in C3 false, so C3 does not hold. Therefore C4 is True.

(If you meant C1 to say ""event1 and event2 both happen"" instead of repeating event1, the conclusion is the same: event1 did not happen, so C1 is false and C4 still true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition from the context: event2 happened initially. Because ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 also happens (it follows event2). After event1 no further events occur. So in the actual run: event2 happened, then event1 happened, and then the process stopped.

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen (so event2 ⇒ event1). In this scenario event2 did happen, so event1 did happen as required.
- After event1 no other events occur (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a conditional statement. Given the actual run event1 did happen and event2 had already happened, so the conditional is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is a disjunction. Since event2 does happen (true), the disjunction is true regardless of C1.
- C3: Same as C1 (identical statement). So C3 is true for the same reason as C1.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value of C4
- C4 is ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" = C2 ∧ C3.
- We found C2 = True and C3 = True, so C4 = True ∧ True = True.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (so the system starts with event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so event1 ⇒ next event2).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so event2 ⇒ next event1).
Starting from event2, these rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … (both events occur repeatedly).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — written as (event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — event1 → (event2 ∨ event1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — always[event1 → (event2 ∨ event1)].
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — eventually[ always[event1 → (event2 ∨ event1)] ].

Note: event1 → (event1 ∨ event2) is a propositional tautology (whenever event1 is true, event1 ∨ event2 is automatically true).

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- C2 is a tautology (it holds in any state).
- Therefore C3 (“C2 always holds”) is true (the tautology holds at every time).
- If something is true at every time then it is certainly true at some future time, so C4 (“C3 eventually holds”) is also true.

Hence C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).
- Additional constraints: (a) after event2, no other events can happen (so the execution is terminal once event2 occurs); (b) after event1, event2 must happen (a firing of event1 would force event2 afterward).

Step 2 — transition/temporal rules
- Event2 occurs initially and makes the run terminal (no further events).
- If event1 ever occurs, it requires that event2 occur afterwards (but that does not happen here because event2 already happened initially and nothing happens after that).

Step 3 — meaning of the Ci
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Logically this is just event2 ∧ event2, which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → C1. Substituting C1 ≡ event2 gives event2 → event2, which is a tautology (always true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 is a tautology that holds at every time, then “eventually C2” is true (there is a time — in fact every time — where C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This is eventually(eventually C2). In standard temporal reasoning eventually(eventually p) ≡ eventually p, so this reduces to eventually C2, which we already said is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Under the ordinary propositional/temporal reading above:
  - C1 ≡ event2 (true because event2 happened initially).
  - C2 is a tautology (true at all times).
  - C3 is true.
  - C4 is true.
- Therefore, C4 is True.

Important caveat (ambiguity)
- If instead C1 was intended to mean “event2 happens twice (at two distinct times)”, then C1 is false here (only one event2 occurred and no events happen after it). Then:
  - C2 (event2 → C1) would be false at the time event2 occurs,
  - C3 and C4 would be false as well.
- So the truth of C4 depends on whether the redundant C1 conjuncts are meant as a mere repetition (logical idempotence) or as a requirement of two separate occurrences. Under the usual logical reading (redundant conjunction), C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (i.e., in the current/initial state event1 has already occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreting this as: once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any subsequent state.
- Rule B: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreting this as: whenever event2 occurs, the next state must have event1.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately following the current one.)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" That is, event2 → (event1 happens next).
- C4: C1 ∧ C3 (both C1 and C3 hold).

4) How do these conditions relate and what's the truth value?
- From the initial condition and Rule A: because event1 already happened, no events can happen afterwards, so in the next state there are no events — in particular event1 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false (and so is C2).
- Rule B matches C3: whenever event2 happens event1 must happen next, so C3 is true (or at least the context asserts the implication). Even if event2 never occurs, the implication is true vacuously; the context explicitly gives it, so take C3 = True.
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 = False ∧ True = False.

Therefore C4 is False.

(If you meant a different reading of ""no other events can happen"" — for example, allowing event1 to occur again but forbidding any different events — tell me and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: Since event1 already occurred and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event1 does not occur in the next state (C1 false). The implication C3 (event2 → event1 next) holds (by Rule B or vacuously if event2 doesn't occur), so C4 = C1 ∧ C3 = False."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event1, no other events can happen (the system is in a terminal/no‑more‑events state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also lead to a terminal state).
So once either event happens, the run becomes eventless thereafter. Because event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur after that point.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (in the next moment/state it is still true that event2 does not happen).
- C3: same as C1 (""Event2 does not happen"").
- C4: C2 and C3 together (both the next‑state version and the global statement).

4) How do they relate and final evaluation?
- Since event1 happened initially and that prevents any further events, event2 cannot occur at any time. Thus C1 is true, and so is C3.
- Because no events can occur after the initial state, the property ""event2 does not happen"" remains true in the next state as well, so C2 is true.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is True.

- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus the only possible execution is: event1 occurs (initially), then event2 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (reading: event1 is guaranteed to occur in the system / in every run)
- C2: the same as C1 (the statement is repeated).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (an implication between the two identical statements)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" (there is some point at which C3 is true — in practice this means C3 holds now or will hold later)

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since event1 happens in the initial state (and the system has that as its only possible behavior), C1 is true under the natural reading “event1 is guaranteed to occur.” C2 is the same and therefore true.
- C3 is the implication C1 → C2. Because C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is true (indeed true immediately).
- C4 asks whether C3 eventually holds. C3 already holds immediately, so C4 is true.

Note on alternate reading: if one read “always happens” as the temporal operator “holds at every timepoint,” then C1 and C2 would be false (event1 does not hold at every future time), but C3 (an implication with a false antecedent) would still be true, so C4 (C3 eventually holds) would still be true. Either way, C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 occurs initially, so C1 and C2 hold; therefore C3 (C1 → C2) holds immediately, and hence C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true. (Even under the alternate reading where ""always"" means ""at every timepoint"", C3 would still be true, so C4 remains true.)"

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.
- Consequence of initial condition: because ""after event1, no other events can happen"", once event1 has happened no further events (including event2) can occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: if event1 occurs, nothing else can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is also terminal: if event2 occurs, nothing else can occur afterwards.
- Given the initial occurrence of event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time in this run.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (a material implication: event2 -> event1)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (exactly the same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (C1 -> C2)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (C3 is true in the situation / in all states under consideration)

Notes on truth values:
- A material implication P -> Q is true whenever P is false (vacuously) or Q is true when P is true.
- In this scenario event2 never happens (because event1 happened initially and prevents further events), so the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is false; therefore both C1 and C2 are vacuously true in the given run.
- C1 and C2 are syntactically the same statement, so C1 -> C2 is true in every possible interpretation (if a statement is identical to another, then ""if the first holds then the second holds"" is always true). Thus C3 is a tautology here.
  
4) How do these conditions relate to each other? Is C4 true or false?
- Because C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 (C1 -> C2) is always true.
- Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 = True, event1 = False).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. (If event1 holds now, then event2 holds in the next state.)
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. (If event2 holds now, then event1 holds in the next state.)
Given the initial event2, the states must alternate: initial state has event2, the next state must have event1, the next after that must have event2, etc.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: event2 ∨ event1 — “at least one of the events happens in this state.”
- C2: ¬C1 — “neither event1 nor event2 happens in this state.”
- C3: event2 ∧ C2 — “event2 happens and neither event happens” (i.e., event2 ∧ ¬(event2 ∨ event1)).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (X C3).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Simplify C3: event2 ∧ ¬(event2 ∨ event1) is equivalent to event2 ∧ ¬event2 ∧ ¬event1, which is a contradiction and therefore always False in any state.
- Hence C3 is unsatisfiable (False everywhere).
- C4 = “C3 holds in the next state” is therefore False (since C3 cannot be true in any state).
- This also matches the transition-based view: initial state has event2, next state must have event1, so even concretely C3 is false in the next state.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

False

Reason: C3 = event2 ∧ ¬(event2 ∨ event1) simplifies to event2 ∧ ¬event2 ∧ ¬event1, a contradiction (always False), so X C3 (C4) is also False."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (call it time t0) event1 happens.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at the next step after any event1, event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate indefinitely: event1 → event2 → event1 → ...).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the first transition rule; C1 is true under the given rules.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says the implication in C1 is true at every relevant time (i.e., it is an invariant). Given the stated transition rule is unconditional, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This is one step higher but, under the same interpretation, also true (C2 is an invariant and remains so).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" This is the conjunction of C3 with the occurrence of event2 at some moment.

Step 4 — how they relate and the verdict on C4
- From the rules we get an alternating sequence starting with event1 at t0, so at t1 event2 happens.
- C3 is an invariant (true at all times) by the assumptions above, so in particular it holds at t1.
- At t1 both parts of C4 are true: C3 holds and event2 happens. Therefore C4 is true (true at the time when event2 occurs).

Minor note on semantics: this assumes ""always"" means a global invariant and that C4 is evaluated at a time when event2 occurs (existence of such a time is guaranteed by the transitions). Under those reasonable readings, C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: the rules force an alternating sequence starting with event1, so event2 does occur (at t1, t3, ...), and C3 (that the implication from event1 to event2 always holds) is an invariant; thus C3 holds and event2 happens, making C4 true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (so the system is terminal after event2).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal if it were to occur).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — means at no time does event1 occur.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" — both event2 occurs and event1 does not occur.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" — at some time (including possibly now) C2 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" — event1 occurs and C3 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- Event2 did happen and C1 holds, so C2 is true.
- C2 is already true (initially), so ""C2 eventually holds"" is true; C3 is true.
- C4 requires event1 to happen, but event1 cannot happen (because event2 already occurred and no further events can occur). So C4 is false.

Conclusion
C4 is False.

Summary answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (so at the start event1 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event2 → event1 afterward).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — it prevents any subsequent events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just event1 (redundant conjunct). Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — this is the implication C1 → event1. Since C1 is equivalent to event1, this implication is trivially true (if event1 then event1).
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" — this requires event2 to happen and C2 to be true. We already have C2 true, so C3 is true iff event2 actually happens.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — asserts that C3 holds at all relevant times (i.e., event2 happens and C2 holds always).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event1 happens initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no occurrence of event2 can happen after that initial event1. There is no evidence allowed by the context that event2 happened before the initial event1, so under the given scenario event2 does not occur.
- Therefore C3 is false (it needs event2 to hold).
- Since C3 does not hold, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False (because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, so C3 fails).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 occurs initially and forbids any later events, so event2 cannot occur; hence C3 (which requires event2) fails, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state (so at time 0 event1 is true).

(Assume a standard linear-time reading: events are properties of states; ""after X"" means at some strictly later state.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. Meaning: once a state with event1 has occurred, in every strictly later state no events (neither event1 nor event2) occur.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. Meaning: if event2 occurs in some state, then there must be a later state in which event1 occurs.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — both events occur (in the same state or considered true at that state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the immediately following state satisfies C1.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future state C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — the next state satisfies C3.

(So C4 is true exactly when, in the next state, there will at some later time be a state whose next state satisfies C1.)

4) How these conditions relate given the rules
- Because event1 already happened initially, Rule A forbids any events in all later states. Therefore event2 can never occur in any state after the initial one.
- Since event2 never occurs, C1 (""event2 and event1"") is false in every state.
- If C1 is always false then C2 (""C1 in next state"") is always false.
- Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false (there is no future state where C2 is true).
- Finally, C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because C3 is never true.

Possible caveat
- If you adopt a different semantics (for example: allowing event2 to occur in the same state as the initial event1, or interpreting ""after"" non-strictly), the verdict could change. Under the usual strictly-later interpretation used above, C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 holds initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" forbids event2 in every later state (and event2 can't co-occur at the initial state because then a later event1 would be required, contradicting the first rule). So C1 is never true, hence C2, C3, and therefore C4 are all false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start.
- Additional constraints: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has happened, the system has no further events.

(I'm assuming no simultaneous occurrences unless you tell me otherwise; the usual sequential reading is that exactly event2 happened initially and event1 did not.)

2) Transition rules
- If event1 occurs, the run ends (no further events).
- If event2 occurs, the run ends (no further events).
- Because event2 occurred initially, the system is in a terminal state with no future events.

3) Meaning of the C-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as a global/always property: at every time point (every state along the run) event1 holds. Equivalently, there is no state in which event1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That is, at every time point, the statement C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Same nesting one level further.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" There exists some time (possibly the present) at which C3 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because the initial state has event2 and no further events can happen, event1 does not hold in the initial state. Therefore C1 is false.
- If C1 is false now, then ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false, and likewise C3 is false.
- Nothing can change in the future (terminal state), so C3 will never become true at any future time.
- Therefore ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is false.

If you allow simultaneous initial occurrence of event1 and event2, or you intended a different interpretation of ""always happens"" (e.g., ""occurs at least once""), let me know and I can re-evaluate under that semantics.

Answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0) event1 holds.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen → if event1 holds in a state, then event2 holds in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 holds in a state, then event1 holds in the next state.
These rules force an alternating sequence: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ….

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Formally: at the current state s, event1 holds at s+1.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” = ¬C1 (event1 does not hold in the next state).
- C3: “C2 does not hold” = ¬C2 = ¬(¬C1) = C1. So C3 is logically equivalent to C1.
- C4: “C3 always holds” = globally(C3) = in every state C3 is true. Since C3 ≡ C1, C4 is equivalent to “always C1” (in every state, the next state contains event1).

4) How they relate and truth value of C4
- From the alternating sequence: at state0 (initial) event1 holds and the next state (state1) has event2, so C1 is false at state0. At state1, the next state (state2) has event1, so C1 is true at state1. So C1 (and therefore C3) holds in some states and fails in others.
- Because C3 fails in the initial state, it is not true in every state. Therefore C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false.

(If “after” were intended to mean “eventually” instead of “next state” the conclusion could differ; under the given C1 definition using “next state”, C4 is False.)

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time/state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has happened (and it already has, initially), there are no further events in any future state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That means if event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur later (after that occurrence of event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just the same as ""event2 happens"" (redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 already asserts event2 happens, C2 is again equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This means: at some future time C2 is true — i.e., eventually event2 will happen.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This means: at every time (always), C3 is true — equivalently, from every point in time there will eventually be an occurrence of event2 (a strong recurring/eventually-from-every-state property).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- Because event1 has already happened initially and rule (after event1 no other events can happen) forbids any further events ever occurring, event2 can never occur at any time.
- Therefore C1 and C2 (which both require event2 occurs) are false.
- C3 (""eventually C2 holds"") is false because there is no future time where event2 happens.
- C4 (""always C3 holds"") is therefore false as well (it would require that from every state there is a future event2, which is impossible under the rules).

So C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event1 already occurred and prevents any further events, event2 can never occur, so C3 (""event2 eventually occurs"") is false at the initial state and thus C4 (""always C3 holds"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 holds.

(I'm reading ""after X"" as ""in the next state after X"". If ""after"" meant ""eventually after"" the conclusion can change; I will use the next-state reading because that is the usual reading for these alternating constraints.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: If event2 holds at time t, then event1 holds at time t+1.
- Rule B: If event1 holds at time t, then event2 holds at time t+1.

Given the initial event1 at t=0, these rules force an alternation:
t=0: event1
t=1: event2
t=2: event1
t=3: event2
... and so on.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — i.e. event1 ∨ event2 holds at a given state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some (current or future) state event1 ∨ event2 holds. In this alternating execution, C1 holds immediately and at every state, so C2 is true at every state.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e. (eventually (event1 ∨ event2)) → event1. This is an implication evaluated at a state: if from that state you have that C1 will eventually hold, then event1 must hold in that state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at time 1 the implication of C3 must be true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At time 1 we have event2 (from the alternation).
- At time 1, C2 (eventually event1 ∨ event2) is true (because the alternation guarantees occurrences in the future).
- But at time 1 event1 is false (event2 holds instead).
- Therefore at time 1 the implication in C3, (C2 → event1), is false (true antecedent, false consequent).
- Hence C3 does not hold at time 1, so C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False under the natural next-state interpretation of ""after"". If instead ""after"" was meant as ""eventually after"", re-evaluate with that semantics — but with next-state reading the alternation gives a direct counterexample at the next state.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

With ""after"" as next-state: t0 event1, t1 event2, t2 event1, ... At t1 C2 (eventually event1∨event2) is true but event1 is false, so the implication C3 (C2 → event1) is false at t1. Therefore C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system remains in a state with nothing new occurring after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (same for event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (a tautological repetition).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — the proposition C1 is true at every timepoint (the temporal “always” operator).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — the statement that “C1 always holds” itself is true at every timepoint.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — claims that C3 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since event1 happened initially and there are no transitions that can produce events that would falsify C1, C1 is true in the initial state and remains true for all future states under the given rules. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. If C2 is true and it stays true, then C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true. C4 states that C3 does not hold, but C3 does hold, so C4 is false.

Note on interpretation: this reasoning assumes that ""event1 happened"" is a persistent fact (or at least that no future transition can make C1 false) and that ""always"" quantifies over all future states. Under that natural reading, C4 is False. (If you instead treat ""happened"" as a strictly instantaneous fact that does not persist and time continues with different truth values, the result could differ; but with the given rules the intended conclusion is that C4 is False.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).  
- Also given: after event2 no other events can happen; and after event1 no other events can happen.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Both event1 and event2 are terminating events: once either happens, no further events can occur afterwards.
- Because event2 has already happened initially, no events can occur after that point (so event1 cannot occur after the start).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does not eventually happen).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not the case that event2 does not happen; so C3 ≡ C1).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds.""

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- C1 is true because event2 already happened initially.  
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.  
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is true (equivalent to C1).  
- C4 requires both (a) event1 happens and (b) C3 holds. C3 holds (true), but event1 does not happen (it cannot happen after event2, and event2 already occurred initially). Therefore C4 is false.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event1 happened (event1 is true at S0).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""after"" as ""in the next state"")
- If event2 occurs in a state, then event1 must occur in the next state: event2 ⇒ next(event1).
- If event1 occurs in a state, then no other events can happen afterwards: once event1 occurs, the following states contain no events (so next state has neither event1 nor event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as event2 is true in every state (i.e. globally true).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — at a given state, C2 is true iff (C1 is true globally) OR (event1 is true in that state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — negation of C2 at that state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — next(C3), i.e. C3 is true in the successor state.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At S0: event1 is true, so C2 is true at S0 (because of the ""or event1 happens"" disjunct). Therefore C3 is false at S0.
- Consider the next state S1 after S0. By the rule “after event1, no other events can happen,” S1 has neither event1 nor event2.
  - C1 is false in S1 (event2 is not true there), and event1 is also false in S1, so C2 is false in S1.
  - Therefore C3 is true in S1.
- C4 asserts that C3 holds in the next state (from S0). Since C3 is true in S1, C4 is true.

So C4 = True under the natural reading above. (If you intended different temporal semantics for ""always"" or ""after"", mention that and I can re-evaluate.)

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (a global statement that event2 never occurs)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (both event1 occurs and event2 never occurs)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (at every time/state, C2 is true)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" (there is some future time when C3 becomes true)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C4?
- From the context, event1 happened initially and event2 must happen afterwards, so event2 does occur. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (which requires C1) is false.
- Because C2 is false, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false (it is not true at even the initial time).
- Since C3 is never true, C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred initially.

2) Transition rules:
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur (i.e. event2 follows event1).
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur (i.e. event1 follows event2).
So the system produces the infinite alternating trace: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) What each condition means:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted as a global implication: every time event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterward. Given the transition rule this is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C1.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Means C2 is true at all times (i.e. C1 is always false).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Means there will be some future time from which C2 holds always (i.e. at some point C1 becomes permanently false).

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- From the transition rules C1 is true (every event1 is followed by event2).
- Therefore C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold) is false.
- Because C2 is false now and never becomes true in the alternating trace, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
- Since C3 never becomes true, C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is also false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (so the system is in a state after event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e., if event1 ever happens, then event2 will occur afterwards).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — once event2 has occurred, the system has no further events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There is some future time at which event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (Conjunction of event1 happening and C1; this is redundant — if event1 happens then C1 holds, so C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"".)
- C3: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (Same as C1.)
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" So C4 ≡ C2 ∨ C3. Since C2 ≡ event1 happens and C3 ≡ event1 happens, C4 ≡ event1 eventually happens (i.e., equivalent to C1/C3).

4) How do these conditions relate given the context?
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 is terminal (no further events allowed), event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- Therefore C1 (event1 eventually happens) is false, C2 is false, C3 is false.
- Hence C4 (C2 or C3) is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Because event2 has already occurred and is terminal (no further events can happen), event1 cannot occur, so C1, C2, and C3 are all false, making C4 (C2 ∨ C3) false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1. What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.

2. What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
These rules require the two events to alternate (event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → …).

3. What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the rules and that event1 has happened, this is asserting that at some (next) point event2 will occur.
- C2: same as C1 (identical statement).
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds — i.e., both C1 and C2 are true.
- C4: C3 does not hold — i.e., the negation of C3.

4. How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the rules and initial event1, event2 must happen (so C1 is true). Since C2 is the same statement, C2 is also true.
- Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) is true.
- C4 is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.

Summary answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Given event1 happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) Meaning and truth of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally event1 → event1. This is a logical tautology (always true). So C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as holding in the actual situation (or at all times), C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- Also: event2 does not happen (because event1 happened and prevents further events).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 true ⇒ C2 false ⇒ C3 false.
- C4 is ""event2 happens or C3 holds"" (event2 ∨ C3). Both disjuncts are false (event2 does not happen, C3 is false), so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., event2 will occur at some point after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given event1 has happened and event2 must happen afterward, C1 is true (both events will occur).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" This is the same statement as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This asserts that at some time C2 becomes true. Since event2 is guaranteed to occur after event1, there will be a time when both events have occurred, so C3 is true. (If evaluated before event2 occurs, C2 might not yet hold, but C3 is still true because C2 will hold eventually.)
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" This is the conjunction of two true statements.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the initial condition and transition rules we deduce event2 occurs, so C1 and C2 are true; therefore C3 is true; hence C4 (C1 ∧ C3) is true.

Final answer: C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the system has no further events — terminal state).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there is some future time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — at every point in time, it is true that event2 will eventually happen (i.e., from any state onward, event2 is guaranteed eventually).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future time, C2 becomes true (from that time onward C1 always holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — at every point in time, it is true that eventually C2 will hold.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 has already happened initially and Rule A forbids any events after event1, no further events can ever occur. In particular, event2 cannot happen at any future time. Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- If C1 is false now and there are no future changes, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false, and consequently C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Thus C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From the initial condition plus Rule A, event1 will (indeed must) occur after the initial event2; then by Rule B nothing happens after event1.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since event2 happened and C1 is true, C2 is true. (Note: C2 is logically redundant here because C1 already asserts event2 happens; together they reduce to ""event2 happens"".)
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 holds (and also event1 will happen by the rules), the disjunction is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This asserts the negation of C3.

4) How the conditions relate and final truth value:
- From initial event2 and the transition rules we get event1 will happen. So C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = True. Therefore C4 (which claims C3 does not hold) is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so event1 holds in the initial state).

2) Transition rules (interpreting “after” as the next-state relation)
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — whenever event2 happens in some state, event1 must hold in the next state.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” — whenever event1 happens in some state, the following state has no events (in particular, event2 cannot happen in the next state). This makes any state with event1 a terminal state for events.

3) What the C-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This is redundant; it simply means event2 holds (C1 ≡ event2).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” So C2 means: in the next state event2 holds.
- C3: “If event1 happens, then C2 holds.” So C3 says: whenever event1 happens, the next state must have event2.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” C4 asserts globally (in every state) that (if event1 then next-state has event2).

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- From the context, after event1 no other events can happen. So if event1 happens in a state, the next state cannot have event2.
- C3 requires that whenever event1 happens, the next state does have event2. That contradicts the rule “after event1, no other events can happen.”
- Because the initial state has event1, C3 is already violated in the initial state. Therefore C3 is not true in all states, so C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false.

Hence C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: the initial state has event1, but ""after event1 no other events can happen"" forbids event2 in the next state, so the implication in C3 (if event1 then next-state has event2) is already violated. Hence C3 does not hold everywhere, so C4 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the timeline starts in a state where event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because the initial state already has event2, and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur at any later time in the timeline.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to simply ""event1 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: same as C1, so also equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds — equivalently, ""event1 happens"" AND ""event1 happens"", which reduces to ""event1 happens"".
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — i.e., at every point in time (or globally) C3 is true, so this asserts that event1 holds at all times.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- Given the initial condition (event2 happened) and the rule that after event2 no other events can happen, event1 never occurs in this timeline.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, and C3 (which is equivalent to event1) is false.
- Hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start (time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen after it.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen thereafter.
Given event2 already happened at time 0, that rule implies no events (including event1) can occur at times >0.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (true if event2 occurs now or at some future time)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (logical OR)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (C2 is true now or at some future time)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (negation of C3)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1: True, because event2 has already happened initially.
- C2: True, because C1 is true (so the disjunction holds regardless of event1).
- C3: True, because C2 already holds now, so it ""eventually"" holds.
- C4: False, because it asserts C3 does not hold, but C3 does hold.

Therefore C4 is False. (If you use a different convention where ""eventually"" excludes the present instant, state that and I can re-evaluate; under the standard convention that ""eventually"" includes the current moment, the above conclusion holds.)

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur next/eventually).
- After event2, event1 must happen (they alternate).

3) Meanings of C1–C4
- C1: event2 eventually happens.
- C2: event1 happens OR C1 holds.
- C3: if C2 holds, then event2 happens.
- C4: C3 holds OR event2 happens.

4) How they relate (derivation)
- From the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 does eventually happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- Since event1 already happened (and also C1 holds), C2 is true.
- C3 is the implication (C2 → event2). Because C2 is true and event2 does in fact happen, that implication is true, so C3 holds.
- C4 is the disjunction (C3 ∨ event2). Both C3 and event2 are true, so C4 is true.

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened (so in this scenario event1 occurs).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (sequence ends after event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the scenario as “event1 does happen” (it did initially).
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens (i.e., event1 happens and event2 happens).
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" (Same as C1.)
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds (C4 = C2 ∨ C3).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" we have event1 occurred and therefore event2 occurs. So C1 (event1 happens) is true, and event2 happens, so C2 is true. C3 is the same as C1 and is also true.
- Logically, C4 = C2 ∨ C3 = (C1 ∧ event2) ∨ C1 = C1 ∨ (C1 ∧ event2) = C1. Since C1 is true, C4 is true.

Note on wording: if ""always"" were intended as a stronger universal temporal claim beyond the given scenario, the conclusion could change; the above assumes the natural reading that the context guarantees event1 happens in the scenario.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 occurs initially and forces event2, so C1 is true and C2 (C1 ∧ event2) is true; hence C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 already happened at the start.
- Also given: after event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (as it already has), no further events can occur in the timeline.

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Rule A: If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards (event2 → later event1).
- Rule B: If event1 occurs, no other events can occur after it (event1 is terminal).

Because event1 has already happened initially and is terminal, event2 cannot occur at any later time. (The only way event2 could have been allowed is if it happened before event1; but we are given event1 is initial, so there is no earlier time for event2 to have happened.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — logically equivalent to ""event2 happens."" (The repetition is redundant.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., event2 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., at all relevant times, event2 does not happen (equivalently: event2 never happens).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — implication: (C3) ⇒ (event2 happens).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth-values
- From the initial state and the terminal nature of event1, event2 does not happen. Therefore:
  - C1 is false.
  - C2 is true.
  - C3 is true (C2 holds always, since nothing changes).
- C4 is the implication ""if C3 then event2 happens."" Here the antecedent C3 is true but the consequent (event2 happens) is false. A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.

Conclusion
- C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C3 is true (event2 never happens) while the consequent ""event2 happens"" is false, so the implication C4 is false."

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value?
- Because event2 already occurred initially and event2 is terminal, no further events (including event1) can occur. Therefore event1 does not happen. So C1 is false. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false. C3 asserts that C2 is true, but C2 is false, so C3 is false. C4 requires both C1 and C3 to be true; since both are false, C4 is false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, the system is terminal — no further events are possible.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must also occur — in particular, event1 must occur after event2.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" — i.e. if event2 happens then event2 does not happen (a conditional whose antecedent is event2 and consequent is not event2).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" — both the conditional C2 is true and event2 actually occurs.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" — C3 is true at all relevant times (i.e. it holds universally/at every state).

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition + Rule A: because event1 has already happened and no events can happen after event1, no event (including event2) can ever happen. Therefore event2 does not happen — C1 is true.
- C2 (if event2 then not event2) is true given C1: since event2 does not occur, the implication is vacuously true (and logically C2 implies C1 anyway).
- C3 requires event2 to happen in addition to C2 holding. But event2 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4 says C3 always holds; since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

Reason: event1 already occurred and Rule A forbids any further events, so event2 never happens (C1 true), making C3 (which requires event2 to happen) false; hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (it occurs initially).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs at some point following event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So a valid execution is: event1 (initial) → event2 → nothing else.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (a claim that event1 never occurs)
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (the same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" i.e. C2 is true at all times (equivalently, event1 never happens ever)
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" i.e. (event1 does not happen) OR (event1 never happens at all)

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- Because the context states event1 does happen initially, the statement ""event1 does not happen"" is false. So C1 = false and C2 = false.
- C3 asserts that C2 always holds; since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4 is C1 OR C3 = false OR false = false.

- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Interpreting ""after"" in the usual state-based way (either as ""in the next state"" or at least ""eventually after""): these rules force alternation between event1 and event2. The simplest and strongest reading is ""in the next state"", which gives the deterministic sequence:
s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ... .
Even if ""after"" only means ""eventually"", the second rule prevents two event2s in a row (a subsequent event1 must occur before the next event2), so two consecutive event2 states cannot happen.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Evaluated at a state t, C1(t) means event2 occurs at the immediate successor of t.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Evaluated at t this means: event2 happens at t AND C1(t) is true (so event2 at t and event2 at the next state).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This is just C2(t) AND event2 at t (redundant — it requires event2 at t and event2 at the next state).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" There exists some future state where C3 is true.

4) Relations and final evaluation
- From the alternation forced by the rules, no two consecutive states can both have event2. Therefore there is no state t where event2 holds at t and also at the next state. Hence:
  - C1 is true at s0 (because s1 has event2) but false at any state that is followed by event1.
  - C2 requires event2 now and event2 next; no state satisfies that, so C2 is false everywhere.
  - C3 is false everywhere (it requires C2).
  - Therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false — there is no future state where C3 holds.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the rules force strict alternation between event1 and event2, so no state can have event2 both now and in the next state. Hence C2 and C3 are impossible anywhere, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false."

Reasoning (brief):

- C1 (event2 → event1) holds (by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen”).
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is true at state0 because in state1 C1 is vacuously true (event2 does not occur there).
- C3 (if C2 holds then event1 happens) would require event1 to happen at state0 whenever C2 holds. But at state0 event1 does not happen (it happens only at state1), so C3 is false at state0.
- Therefore C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.
- Additional rules: if event2 has happened, then no other events can happen afterwards; likewise, if event1 happens, no other events can happen afterwards.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After a state where event2 occurred, any later state has no events occurring.
- After a state where event1 occurred, any later state has no events occurring.
(So from the initial state where event2 happened, there is a next state with no events at all.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true in every state: when event1 does not happen the implication is true (antecedent false), and when event1 does happen the consequent is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally C2 = (C1 → event2). Whether C2 is true in a state depends on whether event2 holds there (since C1 holds everywhere).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" I.e., in the state immediately after the current one, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" I.e., C3 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- In the initial state:
  - C1 holds (tautology).
  - event2 happened (given).
  - Therefore C2 is true in the initial state (C1 true and event2 true).
- In the next state:
  - By the problem statement, after event2 no events happen, so event2 does not happen in the next state.
  - C1 still holds (it's a tautology).
  - Hence C2 = (C1 → event2) is false in the next state (antecedent true, consequent false).
  - Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C4 says ""C3 does not hold"". Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

So with the usual interpretation that events are instantaneous and the implications are evaluated per state, C4 is True. (If you use a different semantics — e.g., events persist across states — the outcome could change, but under the standard reading above, C4 is True.)

Reasoning (brief):

- Timeline: state0: event1 occurs. state1: event2 occurs. state2 onward: neither event occurs.
- C1 (""if event1 happens then event2 happens"") is true at any state where event1 does not occur (vacuously true); at state0 it is also satisfied because event2 occurs next as required. Thus C1 holds at state0 and at every future state.
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1). Since C1 holds at every state, X C1 is true at every state, so C2 is always true.
- C3 = not C2 is therefore always false; it never becomes true.

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event1.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (They alternate: event2 → event1 → event2 → …)

3) Meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (An implication that matches the first transition rule.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (Exactly the same statement as C1.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (C2 is true globally / at all times.)
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" (Conjunction of C1 and C3.)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition. C3 asserts that that proposition holds always.
- The context explicitly gives the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" which is exactly C2 and intended as a global rule, so C2 always holds (C3 is true).
- Since C3 (C2 always holds) is true, C1 (the same implication) also holds. Therefore C4 (C1 and C3) is true.

(Equivalently: C3 implies C1, so C4 is true whenever C3 is true; given the stated transition rule, C3 is true.)

Short answer: C4 is False. All Ci (C1–C4) are false. Reasoning below.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen.
Given rule A and the initial condition (event1 already happened), no further events can ever occur in any future state. (Rule B is redundant here.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” — in temporal logic: F(event2).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — X C1 (i.e. in the immediate successor state, event2 will eventually happen).
- C3: X C2 = X^2 C1 (two steps ahead: event2 eventually happens from that state).
- C4: X C3 = X^3 C1 (three steps ahead: event2 eventually happens from that state).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event1 has already happened and rule A forbids any further events, event2 can never occur in any future state. Therefore:
  - C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false.
  - If C1 is false in the current state, it is false in the next state as well, so C2 is false.
  - Similarly C3 and C4 are false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.
- Extra constraints: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So both event1 and event2 are terminal: if either has happened, there is no successor state with further events.

2) What are the transition rules?
- If event1 occurs, the system reaches a state with no successors (no further events possible).
- If event2 occurs, likewise the system reaches a terminal state.
- Since event1 has already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state and no event2 can occur at any future step.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and simplify)?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 ≡ (event2 happens). (i.e., C1 is true exactly when event2 happens.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — substituting C1 gives C2 ≡ (event2 happens or event2 happens) ≡ (event2 happens). So C2 ≡ event2.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this requires that the immediate successor state satisfies C2 (i.e., that event2 happens in the next state).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state (including possibly the next) where C3 is true.

4) How do these relate and evaluation under the given initial conditions?
- Initially event1 has happened, so event2 has not happened, and no successor states exist (because after event1 no other events can happen).
- Therefore C1 (event2) is false now; C2 is false now.
- C3 asks whether C2 holds in the next state: there is no next state, so C3 is false (no successor makes ""next"" true).
- C4 asks whether C3 will hold at some future point: because there are no future states and C3 is already false, C3 will never hold, so C4 is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False (given the stated semantics that ""happens"" refers to occurrence in the current/next state and that event1 makes the run terminal).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event1 has already happened and both events are terminal (no successor states), event2 can never occur. C2 reduces to ""event2 happens"", so C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false (there is no next state), and therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the initial moment).
- Additional condition: after event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: whenever event1 occurs, there must be a (later) occurrence of event2.
- Combined with the terminality of event2: since event2 already occurred initially and no events can happen after it, no event can occur after that initial event2. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any later time. There is no indication event1 occurred before the initial state, so we take event1 as not occurring.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the given rule and is true as a rule.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event1 to actually happen (and C1 true). Since event1 does not occur, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false (not even true at the initial moment), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is also false.

4) How they relate
- C1 is true (it restates the given transition).
- C2 is false because event1 does not occur.
- That makes C3 false (C2 does not hold always) and therefore C4 false.

- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (not used here because event2 never happens given the initial state).

Step 3 — meaning of each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (logical implication: C1 is false exactly when event1 happens and event2 does not.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 must be true in the actual state(s) considered — here: C1 must hold in every relevant state; if it fails anywhere, C2 is false.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (same nesting: C2 must hold in all states)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (further nesting)

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- event1 did happen initially, and because of the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 does not happen. So the antecedent of C1 is true and the consequent is false ⇒ C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false in the actual state, ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
- If C2 is false, then ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.
- If C3 is false, then ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Conclusion
- C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 occurs and prevents event2, so C1 (""if event1 then event2"") is false; hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false, making C3 false, and therefore C4 false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened (so event2 is true there, event1 is false).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen in any later state (so once event2 has happened, all future states have neither event1 nor event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen in any later state (same for event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — this is evaluated in the current state: C1 = event2 ∨ event1.
- C2: ""event1 happens and C1 holds"" — in the current state: C2 = event1 ∧ C1. (Note: since C1 = event1 ∨ event2, if event1 is true then C1 is automatically true, so C2 is equivalent to simply event1 in the same state.)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — C3 is true in the current state exactly when, in the next state, event1 (and thus C1) holds.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" — evaluated in the current state: C4 = C3 ∧ event2 (current state).

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- Initial state S0: event2 = true, event1 = false.
  - C1 in S0 = true (because event2 is true).
  - C2 in S0 = event1 ∧ C1 = false (event1 is false).
- Next state S1 (after S0): by the rules, no events can happen after event2, so in S1: event1 = false, event2 = false.
  - C2 in S1 = false (event1 is false), so C3 (which asserts C2 in the next state) is false in S0.
- C4 in S0 = C3 ∧ event2 = false ∧ true = false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it happened initially).

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur later (and likewise if event1 occurs, nothing else can occur afterward).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — logically identical to ""event2 happens"" (conjunction of the same fact).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 is just event2, C2 is equivalent to event2.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — since C2 is event2, C3 is equivalent to event2 (because event2 is already true).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e. C3 → event1. Given the equivalences above this is equivalent to event2 → event1.

4) How these relate and evaluation
- We know event2 is true (given) and, because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 is false (it did not and cannot happen after the initial event2).
- Therefore the antecedent of C4 (C3, i.e. event2) is true while the consequent (event1) is false, so the implication C3 → event1 is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C3 reduces to ""event2"" which is true, while event1 cannot occur after event2, so the implication C3 → event1 has a true antecedent and false consequent, making C4 false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the start (time 0) event1 has occurred.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must occur.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
So the system is forced into an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, … (event2 occurs infinitely often, but only at those alternating steps).

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (standard temporal readings: ""happens"" = holds at the current point; ""always"" = holds at every future point; ""eventually"" = holds at some future point)
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just event2 holds at the current point (the conjunction is redundant). So C1 is true exactly at the points in the trace where event2 occurs, false elsewhere.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means event2 holds at every time step (a global invariant: event2 is true everywhere). Given the alternation, that is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts that the invariant C2 itself holds at every time — an even stronger claim; since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether there is some future point after which C3 holds. Because C3 is false at every point (there is never a time from which event2 is true at all future times), C4 is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- C1 holds at the event2 steps only.
- C2 requires event2 at every step — does not hold.
- C3 and C4 therefore do not hold.
Therefore C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because the system forces infinite alternation (event1, event2, event1, ...), there is never a future point from which event2 holds at every time. Hence C2 (G event2) is false at all times, so C3 (G C2) is false at all times, and therefore C4 (F C3) is false."

Answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start (i.e., at the initial moment/event).

2) Transition rules
- Immediately (or next) after event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

A representative timeline consistent with the context: time 0: event1; time 1: event2; then nothing else.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” (read as the usual temporal “always”/“globally”: event1 holds at every moment or across the whole run)
- C2: “Event1 always happens.” (identical to C1)
- C3: “C1 holds and C2 holds.” Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is equivalent to that statement (i.e., event1 always happens).
- C4: “C3 always holds.” (i.e., the property C3 is true at all times / globally)

4) How they relate and verdict
- The context only guarantees that event1 occurs initially (at time 0), not that event1 occurs at every later time. In the concrete timeline above, event1 occurs at time 0 but not at time 1 (event2 occurs then), so the statement “event1 always happens” is false.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, C3 (their conjunction) is false, and so C4 (that C3 always holds) is also false.

(If one used a different reading of “always” — e.g., “in every possible run at least once” — the meanings shift, but under the standard temporal reading “always = globally,” C4 is false.)

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen immediately afterward (i.e., the next state after an event2 must be an event1).
- Rule B: If event1 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (event1 is terminal — after it occurs the system produces no further events).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (true iff in the immediate next state after now, event2 occurs).
- C2: the same as C1 (they are identical statements).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds” — there exists some future time at which C2 is true (i.e., at some future time there is a state whose immediate successor contains event2).
- C4: C1 and C3 both hold now.

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- Because event1 already happened initially and Rule B says no events can occur after event1, no future state can contain any event, in particular event2 can never occur in any future state.
- Therefore C1 is false (the next state does not have event2), C2 is false (same), and C3 is false (there is no future time when C2 is true).
- Hence C4 = C1 ∧ C3 is false ∧ false = False.

So C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already occurred and is terminal (no further events can occur), so C1 and C3 are both false, making C4 = C1 ∧ C3 false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (so at time 0 event1 holds).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreted in the normal temporal sense: once event1 has occurred at some time, no further events (neither event1 nor event2) can occur at any strictly later time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards (or at least eventually). (This rule will turn out irrelevant given the other rule and the initial condition.)

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — written F(event2).
- C2: the same as C1 (redundant).
- C3: C1 and C2, so C3 ≡ F(event2) ∧ F(event2) ≡ F(event2).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ F(C3) ≡ F(F(event2)). In standard linear-time temporal logic F(F P) ≡ F P, so C4 ≡ F(event2). So C1, C3 and C4 are all equivalent to the same property: ""event2 eventually happens.""

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because event1 happened initially and no events may occur after event1, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any later time. Therefore F(event2) is false.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" does not rescue event2 because event2 cannot occur at all given the initial event1 + no-further-events rule.
- Hence C1 is false, C2 false, C3 false, and C4 false.

(If you meant a different semantics for ""after"" — e.g., allowing simultaneous events at the initial instant or allowing event2 to have occurred before the initial event1 — the answer could change. Under the usual reading above, C4 is False.)

Short answer: C4 is False (under the natural reading that ""Event2 does not happen"" means ""Event2 never happens in the run"").

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e. at the start of the run, event2 has occurred).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So any state where event2 has occurred is terminal (no further events).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Similarly, any state where event1 has occurred is terminal.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (Interpretation used below: event2 never occurs in the entire run.)
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: C1 or C2 — i.e. ""Event2 does not happen"" (still the same statement).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some time in the run, C3 becomes true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 already happened initially, the statement ""Event2 does not happen (ever)"" is false. So C1 = false and C2 = false, hence C3 = false.
- The run is already in a terminal state after event2, so no future change can make ""event2 never occurs"" true (the fact that event2 occurred is fixed). Therefore C3 will never become true at any future time.
- Thus C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false.

Note on ambiguity: If you instead read ""Event2 does not happen"" as ""Event2 does not happen in the future from now"" (i.e. it will not occur again), then that statement would be true because event2 already occurred and no further events can happen. But the usual reading of ""does not happen"" in such problems is ""never happens in the run""; under that reading C4 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Under the natural reading ""Event2 does not happen"" = ""Event2 never occurs in the run"", that statement is already false (event2 happened initially) and cannot become true later, so C3 never holds and C4 is false."

Short answer: C4 is True (under the usual reading that “eventX happens” is an instantaneous occurrence at a time). Below is the step‑by‑step reasoning you requested.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened. So at the initial moment event1 occurs.
- Also: after event1 no other events can happen; and after event2 no other events can happen. So each event is terminal.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both events are terminal: once event1 occurs, the system stops and no further events (including event2) can occur; likewise if event2 occurs first, nothing happens afterwards.
- Given the initial occurrence of event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: “event2 happens” (the disjunction is redundant — it just says event2 happens).
- C2: “event1 happens or C1 holds” — equivalently “event1 happens or event2 happens.” So C2 is true at a time if at that time one of those events happens.
- C3: “C2 always holds” — C2 must be true at every time point.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” — the negation of C3.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Timeline: at time 0 event1 happens, so C2 is true at time 0. After time 0 no events occur, so at any later time neither event1 nor event2 “happens” then; therefore C2 is false at those later times.
- Since C2 is not true at all times, C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false.
- Hence C4, which asserts “C3 does not hold,” is true.

Note on an alternate reading: if “eventX happens” is interpreted as a persistent fact meaning “X has happened at some time in the past” (i.e., once true it stays true), then C2 would be permanently true (because event1 did occur initially), making C3 true and C4 false. To resolve that ambiguity you should clarify whether “happens” means “occurs at the current instant” (instantaneous) or “has occurred (ever)” (persistent). Under the typical instantaneous-event reading, C4 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred initially (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards.
- If event2 occurs, then no other events can occur afterwards (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: C1 and C2 hold (so C3 is ""event2 eventually happens"" and ""event2 eventually happens"", equivalently just event2 happens).
- C4: If C3 holds, then event1 happens (a logical implication: C3 ⇒ event1).

(Assumption: ""eventually"" means “at some time in the execution, including the current/initial time.”)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- Because event2 already happened initially, C1 is true and C2 is true. Therefore C3 is true.
- Does event1 happen? Given the initial state is that event2 already occurred and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after that initial point. There is no information that event1 occurred before the initial point, and the phrasing ""initially, event2 happened"" implies event1 did not occur earlier. So event1 does not hold in this scenario.
- C4 is the implication (C3 ⇒ event1). An implication is false exactly when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Here antecedent C3 is true and consequent (event1) is false, so C4 is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False. (If you use a different convention where ""eventually"" means strictly in the future and excludes the initial moment, the truth of C1/C2/C3 could change; with the given usual interpretation, C4 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial fact: event2 happened.

2) Transition rules:
- After event2, event1 must happen. Logically: event2 → event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen (not needed for this question but rules out further events after event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (C1 is the statement event2 → event1.)
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds. (C2 = event1 ∨ (event2 → event1).)
- C3: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (C3 is the same as C1.)
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds. (C4 = C2 ∨ C3.)

4) How they relate and truth values:
- From the context we have event2 is true and the rule event2 → event1 is given, so event1 is true.
- Therefore C1 (event2 → event1) is true (it’s given), and C3 (same as C1) is true.
- Since event1 is true, C2 = (event1 ∨ …) is true.
- C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is therefore true (both disjuncts are true).

Thus C4 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event1 happens.

(Assumption: “after X, Y must happen” means “in the immediate next state/time step”.)

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 happens at time t then event2 must happen at time t+1.
- If event2 happens at time t then event1 must happen at time t+1.
Thus the system alternates: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, …

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “event1 or event2” — true whenever at least one of the events happens in the current state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — at time t this asserts that at t+1 either event1 or event2 holds.
- C3: “event1 happens and C2 holds” — at time t this requires event1 at t and C1 true at t+1.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” — at time t this asserts that at t+1 C3 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Given the alternation, every state has at least one of the two events, so C1 is true at every time.
- Therefore C2 is true at every time (because the next state also has event1 or event2).
- C3 is true exactly in states where event1 occurs (because event1 ∧ C2, and C2 is always true). So C3 holds at t0, t2, t4, …
- C4 asks whether C3 holds in the next state. But whenever event1 holds at some time t (so C3 holds at t), the next state t+1 has event2 (by the rule), so C3 is false at t+1. Thus C3 never holds in the state immediately following any state where it holds, so C4 is false at all times.

Therefore C4 is False.

(If you meant a different interpretation of “after” — for example “event Y must occur sometime later” rather than “immediately next state”, or if both events can co-occur in one state — the answer could change. Tell me if you want the analysis under those alternative readings.)

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event1 happened.

(I'm assuming ""after X"" means ""in the next state"". If you meant ""eventually after X"", see the note at the end.)

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens in a state, then event2 must happen in the next state.
- If event2 happens in a state, then event1 must happen in the next state.
- Starting from s0 with event1, the states alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 this asserts that event2 holds at s1.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e., at every state, C2 is true — equivalently, globally not C1).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (i.e., globally C3 holds — which is the same as globally(always(not C1)); note always(always P) ≡ always P).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the transition rules and s0 = event1, we get s1 = event2, so C1 is true (at s0).
- Therefore C2 is false (at s0).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") requires C2 to be true at every state, but it already fails at s0, so C3 is false.
- C4 is ""always C3"" but since C3 is false at s0, C4 is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

(If instead ""after"" was intended as ""eventually after"", C1 might be false at s0 while event2 occurs later; the alternating rule still forces event2 at some next step so C1 as ""next-state"" would be true under the usual next-state reading. The above assumes the usual next-state interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: At s0 event1 holds, so C1 (""event2 in the next state"") is true at s0, hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false at s0. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false and so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false."

Step 0 — assumption I will use
- I take the claims C1..C4 to be evaluated at the initial state (the state where ""Initially, event1 happened""). ""Next state"" means the immediate successor of that initial state. If you meant a different reference point, say evaluating at some later state, say so and I can re-evaluate.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it t0) event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After an event1 at time t, event2 must occur at time t+1.
- After an event2 at time t, event1 must occur at time t+1.
- So starting from event1 at t0, the sequence is: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … (alternating).

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (under the assumed reference)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e. event1 at t1.
- C2: same as C1 (the statement duplicates C1).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — interpreted consistently as ""C2 holds or event1 happens in the next state"". (If you instead intended the second disjunct to mean ""event1 happens now"", see the alternative interpretation below.)
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"".

Evaluate them under the transition rules:
- At t1 we have event2 (not event1). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 = (C2) or (event1 at t1) = false or false = false.
- C4 = C1 and C3 = false and false = false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and final answer?
- Because the system forces event2 at the next state, any claim that event1 happens in the next state is false. That makes C1 and C2 false, which makes C3 false and therefore C4 false.

Alternative reading (if the ""event1 happens"" disjunct in C3 meant ""event1 happens now at t0""):
- C1 = false, C2 = false, ""(event1 happens now)"" = true (because event1 occurred at t0), so C3 = false or true = true.
- Then C4 = C1 and C3 = false and true = false.

Conclusion: Under the natural reading (and under the alternative reading as well) C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event1 at t0 the system forces event2 at t1, so ""event1 happens in the next state"" (C1 and C2) is false. Hence C3 is false (false or false) and C4 = C1 and C3 is false. Under the alternate reading of C3 (taking the disjunct as ""event1 happens now"") C3 would be true but C1 remains false, so C4 is still false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the trace starts with event2 having occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 will occur after it).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: once event2 has happened, the trace ends).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just the proposition ""event1 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 holds at all times (i.e., event1 happens at all relevant points / in all states).
- C3: same as C1 (identical to C1).
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" — C2 ∨ C3.

4) How do these conditions relate given the context?
- The initial event2 has occurred and event2 is terminal, so no further events (including event1) can ever occur after the initial state. Therefore ""event1 happens"" is false in this run.
- Hence C1 is false and C3 is false. C2 (""always C1"") is also false because C1 is not true.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∨ C3 = False ∨ False = False.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (it already happened).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward (event2 ⇒ event1).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to saying event1 happens (redundant conjunction). So C1 is true because event1 happened initially.
- C2: Same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. C2 is false. But since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" — a logical implication C1 ⇒ C3.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- We have C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = False.
- An implication C1 ⇒ C3 is false exactly when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.
- Therefore C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus once event1 has occurred the system has reached a state where no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) What does each condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e. in the run/trace, event2 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some time in the future (possibly now) C1 becomes true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — at every time point, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — the negation of C3.

(If you prefer temporal-logic reading: ""eventually"" = F, ""always"" = G. C2 = F(C1), C3 = G(F(C1)), C4 = ¬G(F(C1)).)

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 has already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 can never happen. So C1 is true immediately.
- If C1 is true now then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is true (it holds already).
- If C2 holds now and the system never changes (no further events), C2 holds at every time, so C3 is true.
- C4 is the negation of C3, therefore C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 happens, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs, then event2 will occur afterwards).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly Rule B.
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate): ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" So C3 asserts both that Rule B is true and that event1 actually occurs.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" (i.e., C1 ⇒ C3).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is true/false?
- From the context, C1 (and C2) are true because Rule B is stated in the context.
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2 (Rule A), there is no possibility for event1 to occur after the initial event2. There is no information that event1 occurred before the initial state, so on the usual reading event1 does not happen. Therefore the conjunct ""event1 happens"" in C3 is false, so C3 is false (even though C2 is true, the conjunction is false).
- C4 is the implication ""C1 ⇒ C3"". Since C1 is true and C3 is false, the implication is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

(Clarification: If you allowed a reading in which event1 had already occurred before the stated initial event2, then C3 could become true and C4 would become true; but with the standard reading that ""initially event2 happened"" is the current/earliest fact and no evidence event1 occurred, the correct conclusion is that C4 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 is true (rule B), but C3 is false because event1 does not occur (event2 already happened and prevents further events). A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication C4 false."

Answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred the system has no further event changes).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 will occur sometime afterward).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 is false / did not occur)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 ≡ not(C1). That is equivalent to ""Event2 does happen.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 ≡ not(C2). Because C2 ≡ not(C1), C3 is equivalent to C1 (double negation): C3 ≡ C1 ≡ ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the successor (next) state, C3 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- At the initial state we know event2 did happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 = not(C1) is true.
- Since C2 is true, C3 = not(C2) is false.
- C4 asserts that C3 is true in the next state.

Now consider the next state given the transition rules:
- Because event2 already happened and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" there is no change that could make event2 un-happen in any successor. Either (a) there is no successor state at all, in which case a ""next"" assertion is false by standard interpretation, or (b) any successor state exists but no events change, so event2 still holds there. In both readings, C3 (which asserts event2 does not happen) is false in the next state.

Therefore C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 holds initially, so C1 is false, C2 true, C3 false; because no successor can make event2 false (and if no successor exists, ""next"" formulas are false), C3 cannot be true in the next state, so C4 is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at time 0, event1 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" = if event2 occurs, then nothing can occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" = if event1 occurs, then nothing can occur afterward.
Because event1 occurs initially, no other events can occur after that point (so event2 does not and cannot occur later).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a redundant disjunction).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ Event1 happens.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds ≡ (Event1) and (Event1) ≡ Event1 — so C3 is true exactly when event1 happened.
- C4: C3 does not hold — the negation of C3.

4) How they relate and final truth value:
- From the initial condition, event1 did happen, so C1 is true and C2 is true, hence C3 is true.
- C4 is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 happens (at the initial time).
- After event2 no other events can happen (so the system reaches a quiescent/terminal state).
- Also: after event1 no other events can happen (same kind of terminal behaviour if event1 ever happens).

2) Transition rules
- If event2 occurs, the system moves to a state in which no further events occur.
- If event1 occurs, the system moves to a state in which no further events occur.
- Given the initial condition, event2 has already occurred, so we are at (or immediately reach) the terminal state with no further events.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
I will use the natural readings; both reasonable interpretations below lead to the same final verdict.

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
  - Reading A (instantaneous): at a given time point, event2 is not occurring.
  - Reading B (global/ever): event2 never occurs at any time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — there exists a future time where C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" — logical OR between C2 and the proposition ""event2 happens (at some relevant time).""
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — the negation of C3.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- We know event2 did happen initially.
- Under Reading B (C1 = ""event2 never happens""): C1 is false (because event2 already happened) and cannot become true later, so C2 is false. However ""event2 happens"" is true, so C3 = (false or true) = true. Therefore C4 = not C3 = false.
- Under Reading A (C1 = ""event2 not occurring at a time""): C1 is false at the initial instant (because event2 occurs there), but once the system moves to the subsequent terminal state no events occur, so C1 is true at that later time; hence C2 (""eventually C1"") is true. Also ""event2 happens"" is true (it happened initially), so C3 = (true or true) = true. Therefore C4 = not C3 = false.

In every reasonable interpretation, C3 holds, so C4 (which asserts C3 does not hold) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs initially, so C3 (""C2 or event2 happens"") is true; therefore C4 (the negation of C3) is false."

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (time 0): event1 is true.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → if event2 is true at time t then event1 is true at time t+1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → if event1 is true at time t then event2 is true at time t+1.
These two rules force an alternation: starting with event1 at t=0, the sequence is
t=0: event1
t=1: event2
t=2: event1
t=3: event2
… (event1 at even times, event2 at odd times).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the formula event1 → event1 evaluated in the current state. That is a tautology (always true) in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 holds in the current state."" So C2 is true exactly at the states where event2 is true (the odd times).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So C3 at time t means ""event2 holds at time t+1.""
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" So C4 at time t means ""C3 holds at time t+1"", i.e. ""event2 holds at time t+2.""

4) How they relate and final answer
- With the alternating sequence above (e2 at odd times), C4(t) is true exactly when event2(t+2) is true, i.e. when t+2 is odd, which is when t is odd. So:
  - At the initial state t=0: C1 = true, C2 = false (no event2 at t=0), C3 = true (event2 at t=1), C4 = false (event2 at t=2 is false).
  - In general: C4 is true at odd times and false at even times.

Therefore, evaluated at the initial state (t=0), C4 is False. If you meant a different evaluation time, C4 is true exactly at the odd time steps.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: starting from t=0 with event1, the sequence is event1 (t=0), event2 (t=1), event1 (t=2), ...; C4 at t=0 asserts event2 at t=2, which is false."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so event2 ⇒ event1 at a later time).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so event1 ⇒ event2 at a later time).
These imply that once one occurs, the other must occur afterwards (they force each other).

3) Meaning / logical form of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" = event2 ∨ event1.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬(event2 ∨ event1) = ¬event2 ∧ ¬event1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 = ¬(¬event2 ∧ ¬event1) = event2 ∨ event1. (So C3 ≡ C1.)
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" = event2 ∧ (event2 ∨ event1) = event2. (So C4 is equivalent to event2.)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" applies, event2 will happen (at some later time). Thus event2 is true.
- Therefore C4 (which simplifies to event2) is True.

Short answer: C4 is False (given the usual reading that there is a next state in which no events occur). Below is the step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and the initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e. once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (not used here, since event2 does not occur after the initial event1).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — interpreted as “in the considered state, event1 does not hold.”
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds” — a disjunction: either event1 holds in that state, or it does not.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — the formula C2 is true in the successor state.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” — negation of C3.

4) How these relate and evaluation
- At the initial state: event1 happened. So C1 is false there, and C2 is true (because event1 happens).
- In the next state: by the rule “after event1, no other events can happen,” the next state (if we consider it) has no events, so event1 does not happen there. Thus C1 is true in the next state, and therefore C2 is true in the next state. Hence C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true.
- C4 says “C3 does not hold”; since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Note on semantics: if your logic treats “next” as undefined when there is no successor state (i.e. there is no next state after event1), then C3 would be considered false and C4 true. Under the standard assumption that there is a next state (with no events), C4 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 occurs initially, so in the next state (which exists but has no events) C2 holds (since event1 does not hold there but C1 does), so C3 is true and therefore C4 (¬C3) is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 already happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” (If event1 occurs, the system is terminal.)
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” (If event2 occurs, the system is terminal.)
Because event2 happened initially, the system is already in a terminal situation: no events can occur after the initial state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (i.e. at the immediate successor of the initial state.)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (i.e. not(C1).)
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens.” (C2 ∨ event2 happens.)
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” (not(C3).)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1 is false: since event2 already happened initially and “after event2 no other events can happen,” event2 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C2 = not(C1) = True.
- Then C3 = C2 ∨ (event2 happens) = True ∨ (whatever) = True.
- Finally C4 = not(C3) = False.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 has happened and after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no next state and event2 does not occur.
- C1 (""if event1 then event2"") is false in the initial state (antecedent true, consequent false).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state (so a next-operator formula is not satisfied).
- Hence C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at least once) at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must happen (so any time event2 occurs, a later event1 will occur).
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must happen (so any time event1 occurs, a later event2 will occur).
- Together these rules force an alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 …; in particular both events do happen (in fact infinitely often under the rules).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” Interpreted as “both events occur (at least once).” Given the initial event2 and the transition rules, C1 is true.
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” Read as a material implication (or universally: whenever event2 occurs, C1 holds). Since event2 does happen and C1 is true, C2 is true. Under the transition rules, every occurrence of event2 is followed by an event1, so the implication holds.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” This asserts that C2 is false. But we just found C2 to be true, so C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” This asserts that C3 is false. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 is true.
- C2 is true.
- C3 is false.
- C4 is true.

Therefore, C4 is True. (This reasoning assumes the usual readings: “happens” = occurs at least once, and “if … then …” = material/implicational form or universal implication tied to the given transition rules.)

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1. What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2. What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So once either event occurs, no further events occur afterward.

3. What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — a disjunction; true if at least one of the two events happens.
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — both C1 and C2 true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — the negation of C3.

4. How do these conditions relate to each other (apply the facts)?
- Because event2 happened initially, the disjunction ""event1 or event2"" is true. So C1 is true. Likewise C2 is true.
- Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) is true.
- C4 asserts that C3 does not hold; since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happens.

2) Transition rules
- Immediately after a state where event1 happened, the next state must have event2.
- After a state where event2 happened, no other events can happen in any later states (i.e. all subsequent states are event-free).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is a statement about the next state relative to the current state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as a global (always/global) claim: in every state, event2 occurs in the next state.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" The negation of C2 (i.e. it is not true that C1 holds in every state).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" At some state now or in the future, C3 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At the initial state: event1 happened, so by the rule event2 must happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2 (C1 always holds) is false: after the state where event2 occurs there are no further events, so there is a state after which event2 does not occur in the next state. Thus C1 does not hold in every state, so C2 is false.
- C3 (C2 does not hold) is therefore true (it already holds).
- C4 (C3 eventually holds) asks whether C3 holds at some point in the future. Since C3 holds already (from the start), C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

(If one used a different formal interpretation of ""always"" or ""next,"" the same conclusion follows from the given rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"": that prevents C1 from holding at every state, so C2 fails and C3/C4 hold.)

Step 1 — what events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.
- Additional global rule: once event1 has happened, no other events can happen afterwards (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — transition / temporal rules
- Rule: If event2 happens (at some time), then event1 must happen after that. (In practice this means event2 implies a later occurrence of event1.)
- But because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. So either event2 never occurs, or if it had to occur prior to the initial event1 it would have to be before the initial moment — in the usual reading here event2 simply never occurs in the timeline that follows the initial event1.
- The implication “after event2, event1 must happen” is therefore vacuously satisfied (there is no time at which event2 occurs so there is no counterexample).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” This is a global claim that event1 never occurs.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” That is ¬C1 — equivalently “event1 does happen.”
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” That is ¬C2 — equivalently “event1 does not happen” (same content as C1).
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” I.e., at some time in the future C3 becomes true (there exists a time where C3 is true).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- From the initial condition, event1 did happen, so the proposition “event1 does not happen” (C1) is false.
- Therefore C2 = ¬C1 is true (event1 does happen).
- C3 = ¬C2 is false (it is the same as C1).
- Because event1 has happened and prevents any further events, nothing changes later: C1 stays false, C2 stays true, and C3 stays false for all future times.
- Hence “C3 eventually holds” (C4) is false — there is no future time at which C3 becomes true.

Summary (truth values)
- C1: False
- C2: True
- C3: False
- C4: False

So C4 is False.

- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward).
- Together these rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … (each occurrence guarantees the next).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (interpreted as: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will eventually occur). Given the transition rules, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is also false.

4) How they relate
- C1 and C2 are logical opposites; only one can be true. The transition rules make C1 true, so C2 is false.
- C3 asserts the persistent truth of C2; that fails because C2 is false.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial (current) state, event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so event1 → event2 next).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (relative to the current/initial state)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This means: in the next state, the statement C1 is true — i.e., from the next state’s perspective, event1 happens in the following state (two steps ahead from the original state).
- C3: same as C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds.""

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Because the initial state already has event2 and rule B says no events can occur after event2, no events (including event1) can occur in the next state or any later state.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., event1 would happen two steps ahead); since no events can occur after event2, C2 is false.
- C4 = C2 OR C3 = False OR False = False.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 happened (so E2 is true at the start, and by the transition rules the two events will alternate thereafter).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After E2, E1 must happen.
- After E1, E2 must happen.
So starting from E2, E1 will happen next, then E2 again, and so on. Thus both E1 and E2 do happen (at least at some times).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — logical form: C1 = E1 ∨ E2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — logical form: C2 = C1 ∨ E1. But C1 ∨ E1 simplifies to E1 ∨ E2 (since adding E1 again does nothing), so C2 is logically equivalent to C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — logical form: C3 = ¬C2.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" — C4 = E1 ∧ C3.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the initial condition E2 is true, so C1 = E1 ∨ E2 is true (because E2 is true).
- Since C2 ≡ C1, C2 is also true.
- C3 = ¬C2 is therefore false.
- C4 = E1 ∧ C3 requires C3 to be true, but C3 is false, so C4 is false (even though E1 will be true at some point, the conjunction with false is false).

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This asserts that C1 is false. Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is false.

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is a global claim that at all times at least one of the events happens; under the intended alternating interpretation this is true at every event occurrence time, so C2 holds.
- C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true at times when event1 happens (since C2 is global and holds).

Short answer: C4 is True (assuming standard temporal semantics where ""eventually"" may include the current state and there is a next state).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen in any later state (so at all states s1, s2, ... after s0, neither event1 nor event2 will occur).
- If event1 happens at some state, then event2 must happen afterwards (i.e. event1 ⇒ eventually event2). This is moot here because event2 already happened initially.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — a state formula true exactly in states where event2 or event1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some current or future state where C1 is true (standard F operator).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — ¬(eventually C1).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — X C3 (C3 is true in the immediate successor state).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At s0: event2 is true, so C1 is true at s0.
- Therefore C2 (""eventually C1"") is true at s0 (it already holds now).
- Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false at s0.
- Consider the next state s1: because no events can happen after event2, neither event1 nor event2 holds at s1, so C1 is false in s1 and in all later states. Thus at s1, C2 is false (there is no future state with C1), so C3 is true at s1.
- Therefore X C3 (C4) is true at s0.

Notes / corner cases
- If you assume there is no next state at all (the trace terminates at s0), then X C3 is undefined or false under many semantics. Under the usual infinite-trace assumption (or if time continues with no events), the conclusion above holds.
- Whether ""eventually"" counts the current state or only strict future does not change the final answer here: in both interpretations C4 comes out true under the usual assumption that a successor state exists.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: at s0 event2 holds so C1 and thus C2 hold at s0, making C3 false at s0. In the immediate successor s1 no events occur, so C1 is false everywhere from s1 onward, hence C2 is false at s1 and C3 true at s1. Therefore X C3 (C4) is true at s0. (If there is no successor state, X C3 would be undefined/false under many semantics.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So the rules force alternation: starting from the initial event2, event1 will happen next, then event2, then event1, and so on. Therefore both event1 and event2 do occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the Ci
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e. at least one of the two events occurs.
- C2: same as C1 (identical statement).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" — i.e. event1 occurs, and at least one of the events occurs (C2).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" — an implication from the disjunction to the conjunction.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial event2 and the transition rules, both events will occur (event2 already has, event1 must occur next). So C1 is true (disjunction satisfied), and C2 is true (same).
- Since event1 does occur and C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4 is the implication ""if C1 then C3."" With C1 true and C3 true, the implication is true. Moreover, under the given rules there is no reachable situation where C1 holds but event1 never happens (the rules force event1 after event2), so there is no counterexample to the implication.

Conclusion
- C4 is True (given the stated initial condition and transition rules). 

Note: This assumes ""happens"" is interpreted in the usual temporal sense (events that actually occur under the given rules). If you intended a different temporal reading (e.g., ""happens right now"" vs. ""happens eventually""), let me know and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C3 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (since C2 is the disjunction). Given the initial event2 and the transition rules, event1 does occur, so C1 and C3 are true. Hence the implication C4 (""if C1 then C3"") is true. If you meant a different temporal reading (e.g., ""happens now"" vs. ""happens eventually"") the answer could change; under the usual eventual-occurrence reading it is True."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So from the context we know event2 indeed happens.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the statement P → P (with P = ""event2 happens""). P → P is a tautology (always true under material implication).
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 holds, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This is C1 → C3.

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- C1 is true; C3 is false. An implication true → false is false.
- Therefore C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 is true (P → P is a tautology). C2 is the same so true, hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false. C4 is C1 → C3, i.e. true → false, which is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
Therefore, once event1 or event2 has occurred, the system produces no further events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — means in the state immediately after the current one, event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — both that event2 happens next and event1 happens now.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 is true in every state (globally).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 is true in every state (i.e., it is always the case that C2 always holds).

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluate here?
- Timeline: initial state s0: event1 has happened. Because ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" the next state s1 has no events; in particular event2 does not happen in s1.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen next).
- C2 = (C1 and event1) is false because C1 is false (even though event1 is true initially).
- C3 = ""always C2"" is false because C2 does not hold in the initial state (so it is not true in every state).
- C4 = ""always C3"" is false because C3 itself is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Initially event1 has occurred and both event1 and event2 are terminal, so in the next state event2 does not happen. Thus C1 is false, so C2 (C1 and event1) is false, so C3 (""always C2"") is false, and therefore C4 (""always C3"") is false."

- C1 = (event2 and event2) is just event2; at t0 C1 is false.

Step 1 — What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it occurred initially).

Step 2 — Transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the sequence stops after event1).

Step 3 — What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., ¬event2)
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬event2).
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Symbolically: event2 → C3.

Step 4 — How do these conditions relate and is C4 true or false?
- From the initial condition we know event2 did happen, so the antecedent of C4 (event2) is true.
- C3 is equivalent to ""event2 does not happen,"" which is false given the initial condition.
- An implication A → B is false exactly when A is true and B is false. Here A is true and B is false, so the implication is false.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the Cs
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — both events must occur at some point.
- C2: ""event1 happens and C1 holds"" — requires event1 and C1.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future time C2 becomes true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — at every time point, C3 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur after that. Thus event1 does not (and cannot) happen later.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not happen).
- C2 is false because it requires C1 (and event1).
- C3 is false because C2 will never become true.
- C4 is false because C3 is not true (so it cannot be true at all times).

Note: if you allowed both events to occur simultaneously at the initial moment (i.e., event1 and event2 happened at the same instant), a different evaluation would be possible (C1–C4 could all be true).

Summary answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must (later) happen.
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterwards).

Given the initial condition that event1 already happened, Rule B prevents any further events, so event2 cannot occur at any time.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because it already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This requires event2 to occur. But event2 cannot occur (see above), so C2 is False.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is true: either because C2 is false (making the implication vacuously true) or because C2 explicitly includes C1 (event1 happens), so C2 would itself guarantee event1. In either reading, C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is False.

4) Relationship / final conclusion
- C1 = True
- C2 = False
- C3 = True
- C4 = False

Therefore C4 is False. (Assumes standard propositional/temporal semantics and the given rules.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already happened, so C1 is true and rule B prevents event2, making C2 false. The implication C3 (""if C2 then event1"") is therefore true (vacuously, since C2 is false), so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any state where event2 has just happened must be followed by a state where event1 happens).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 leads to a terminal state with no further events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — evaluated in the current state.
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen"" — same as C1 (the hypothesis repeats it).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event1 does not happen.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" — if event1 does not happen now, then event1 does not happen in the next state.

4) How do these conditions relate and final evaluation?
- In the initial state event2 has happened, so event1 has not yet happened there. Thus C1 (and C2) are true in the initial state.
- But the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to have event1. That makes C3 (event1 does not happen in the next state) false.
- Therefore the implication C4 (true antecedent, false consequent) is false in this scenario.

So C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so ""event1 happened"" is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen → since event1 happened, event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen → nothing occurs after event2.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the initial condition, C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is a conditional statement about C1.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1) so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Another conditional relating C2 to C3.

4) How they relate / truth values
- C1: false (contradicted by the context).
- C3: false (same as C1).
- C2: true. In standard logic the conditional ""if C1 then event2"" is true when its antecedent C1 is false (vacuously true). (Also, independent of vacuity, event2 does in fact occur in the scenario.)
- C4: false. Its antecedent (C2) is true while its consequent (C3) is false, so the implication ""if C2 then C3"" is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur next.
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur next.
- Together these force an alternating sequence starting from t0:
  t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … (forever alternating).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; logically C1 ⇔ event1 happens (true at times t1, t3, t5, …).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is equivalent to event1, C2 is the implication (event1 → event1), which is always true wherever evaluated (a tautology).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts ¬C2. But C2 holds everywhere, so C3 is false everywhere.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asserts that at some future time C3 becomes true.

4) How they relate → final conclusion
- Because the system enforces alternating events, event1 does occur repeatedly (so C1 is true at the event1 times).
- C2 is always true (tautological), so C3 (¬C2) is never true.
- Therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false: C3 never holds, so it never becomes true in the future.

Hence C4 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 (event1 → event1) is always true, so C3 (¬C2) is never true; therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is True (given the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time t0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur at the next step.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur at the next step.
So from t0 onward the events alternate: event1 at t0, event2 at t1, event1 at t2, event2 at t3, etc.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (read as a global property: event2 occurs at the relevant times required by the claim — under the usual reading this means “event2 holds at every time point” or, at least, “event2 holds whenever the claim is evaluated.”)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (the negation of C1)
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” (i.e. at t1, C2 is true)
- C4: “If C3 holds, then event2 happens.” (an implication from C3 to event2)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- C1 is false: event2 does not hold at t0 (t0 had event1), so “event2 always happens” is false.
- Therefore C2 is true (it asserts C1 is false).
- Since C1 is false in the whole timeline, C2 is also true at the next state (t1). Thus C3 is true at t0.
- Given the transition rules, event2 does occur at t1. Interpreting C4 as the implication “if C3 holds (i.e. C2 true at t1) then event2 happens (at that next step)”, the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, so the implication C4 is true.

Note on ambiguity: if you interpret “always” or the timing of the consequent in a different formal way, the truth value could be read differently; under the natural temporal reading above C4 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: t0 has event1 so C1 (""event2 always"") is false and C2 true. C2 is also true at t1, so C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true at t0. By the rules, event2 occurs at t1, so the implication ""if C3 then event2"" is true."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so an occurrence of event1 forces an occurrence of event2 later — at least at the next step or eventually, depending on exact semantics).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so occurrences alternate: event1 → event2 → event1 → ...).

Because event1 holds initially and each occurrence forces the other event, event2 will definitely occur at some point after the initial event1.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., event2 eventually happens (there exists a future time when event2 holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e., it is not the case that event2 eventually happens (so event2 never happens).
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"" — i.e., event1 ⇒ (event2 never happens).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From (1) and (2), event1 initially true and the rules force event2 to occur afterwards, so C2 is true (event2 does eventually happen).
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.
- C4 is the implication: if event1 then C3. The antecedent (event1) is true initially, but the consequent (C3) is false, so the implication is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False. (This remains true whether ""after"" means the immediate next step or eventually — in either interpretation the mutual forcing plus initial event1 guarantees event2 occurs.)

Short answer: C4 is False (under the natural reading below). Now the step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- There are two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start of the timeline (i.e. initially event2 happened).

(Implicit assumption used below: the timeline starts with that initial event2 and we do not assume there were earlier events unless explicitly allowed.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e. any occurrence of event1 must be followed by an occurrence of event2).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — nothing can follow it).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant disjunction; it is equivalent to the single proposition ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: same as C1 (also equivalent to ""Event1 happens"").
- C3: C1 and C2, so C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (conjoining two identical claims gives the same claim).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — interpreted as “C3 is true in the system (at all times / in all reachable states).” Concretely this requires that event1 happens (and keep holding as required by the intended reading of “always”).

4) How these relate and conclusion
- Because event2 has already happened initially and rule B says nothing can happen after event2, no further events can occur after the initial moment. That blocks any occurrence of event1 at any later time.
- Under the natural assumption that the timeline begins with that initial event2 (so event1 cannot have occurred before the initial point), event1 never happens. Therefore C1 and C2 are false, C3 is false, and C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Notes on alternative readings:
- If you allow arbitrary past events (i.e. event1 could have happened strictly before the “initial” event2), then C1/C2 could be true and C4 might be true depending on the precise temporal semantics you intend. 
- If you allow event2 to occur multiple times (so the initial event2 doesn’t forbid a later event2), the conclusions can change; you must then specify whether ""initially event2 happened"" means “some event2 already occurred” versus “event2 is forever terminal from the start.”

With the usual interpretation (initial event2 occurs at the start and is terminal), C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because event2 has already happened and is terminal (no events can occur after it), event1 cannot occur, so C3 (which requires event1) is false and therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false."

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Given that event2 happened initially, no other events can occur afterward.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts C2 is false. Since C2 is indeed false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This asserts C3 is false. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

4) How they relate
- The statements form a simple chain of negations about the previous one: C2 = ¬C1, C3 = ¬C2, C4 = ¬C3.

Short answer: C4 is True (under the usual interpretation of “after” = eventually later and “eventually” = at some time ≥ now). Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the initial time.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur later (i.e. whenever event2 happens, event1 will eventually happen).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur later (i.e. whenever event1 happens, event2 will eventually happen).

Together these force an alternation: because event1 has occurred initially, event2 must occur later; after that event1 must occur later; and so on.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens” (F event1).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” (F C1, i.e. F(F event1)).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds” (F C2, i.e. F(F(F event1)))).
- C4: “C3 holds and event2 happens” (C3 ∧ event2).

Note: in standard temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 and C3 reduce back to F event1.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- C1 is true because event1 already occurred initially.
- Therefore C2 = F(C1) is true (F(F event1) = F event1 and C1 is true now).
- Similarly C3 is true.
- From the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” and the initial occurrence of event1, event2 will indeed occur at some later time, so “event2 happens” is true.
- Hence C4 = C3 ∧ event2 is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True (assuming the usual meanings of “after” and “eventually”).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 has already occurred, so ""event1 eventually happens"" holds now; by F(F p) ≡ F p the nested ""eventually"" conditions (C2, C3) also hold, and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees event2 will occur later—so C3 ∧ (event2 happens) is true."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen after it (event1 is terminal).

Because event1 already happened initially, the system is already in the post-event1 situation and no further events can occur (so event2 cannot occur later).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the natural way given the context, event1 has happened already and nothing can undo it, so in every reachable state the fact ""event1 has happened"" holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is just the conjunction of C1 with the factual occurrence of event1; given C1 and the initial event1, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true in the initial (and only) reachable states and no transitions can invalidate it, C2 holds at all times — so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This asserts the negation of C3.

4) How they relate and final truth value
- From the initial event1 and the ""no further events"" rule, C1 is true → C2 is true → C3 (that C2 always holds) is true. Therefore C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.

Note on ambiguity: if you intended a different formal meaning of ""always"" (e.g., something else about occurrences at every instant), the conclusion could change; with the standard interpretation above, C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0), event2 has happened (event2 holds at state0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: Immediately after a state where event2 holds, the next state must have event1 (i.e., if event2 holds at some state s, then event1 holds at the next state s+1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can occur in later states (i.e., once event1 holds at a state, subsequent states have no events).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — at the current state s this asserts event2 holds at s+1.
- C2: same as C1 (given text says C2 is the same).
- C3: C1 and C2 — logically equivalent to C1 (since C1 and C1 is just C1).
- C4: “C3 always holds” — C3 must hold at every state (globally).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Examine the initial state (state0): event2 holds at state0 by the initial condition.
- By Rule A, the next state (state1) must have event1. Therefore event2 does not hold at state1 (unless simultaneous events were allowed, but the rules imply event1 is the required next event and after event1 no other events happen).
- So at state0, C1 (“event2 holds at the next state”) is false. Hence C3 is false at state0.
- Because C3 fails at state0, C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false.

Therefore C4 is False. (Counterexample: the initial state is a state where C3 does not hold.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: at the initial state s0 event2 holds, but by the rules s1 must have event1 (and no further events), so event2 does not hold at s1. Thus C1 (and hence C3) is false at s0, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so event1 follows).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so event2 follows).
Thus, from the initial event2 you get an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (event2 happens infinitely often).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Logically this is p → p, which is a tautology — it is true in all cases (whether event2 happens or not).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is true (regardless of whether event2 actually occurs at a given moment).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 holds, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asserts that at some future time C3 becomes true.

4) How they relate and the conclusion
- C1 is always true, so C2 is always true.
- Therefore C3 (¬C2) is always false — it never becomes true at any time.
- Consequently, ""eventually C3"" (C4) is false.

So C4 is False. (If you intended a different formal reading of C1/C2 — e.g., a temporal ""after event2, event2 must happen again"" rather than the propositional p→p — say so and I will re-evaluate.)

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean

- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is logically true: if event2 holds at some state, then “event2 eventually happens” is true at that state (the occurrence can be at that same state). So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 does hold, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the immediate next state C3 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation

- Consequently, C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state after event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the state after event1 is terminal).
So whichever event occurs, the system reaches a terminal state with no further transitions. In our run, event2 has already occurred so we are in a terminal state with no successor.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting with standard temporal operators)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — read as globally/eventually? The natural reading is the temporal ""always"" (G): event1 holds at every state of the run. (Either way, in this model it fails; I use G.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — G(C1): at every state C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — F(C2): at some state now or in the future C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — X(C3): in the immediate successor state, C3 is true.

(If you prefer other operator conventions, let me know; the conclusion below uses the usual LTL meanings: G = always, F = eventually (now or later), X = next.)

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Since the initial state has event2 (not event1) and is terminal, C1 (G event1) is false immediately.
- C2 = G(C1) is therefore false.
- C3 = F(C2) asks whether C2 will be true now or at some future state. C2 is false now and there are no future states (terminal), so C3 is false.
- C4 = X(C3) asks whether C3 holds in the next state. There is no next state (because we are in a terminal state after event2), and under the standard semantics X φ is false when there is no successor. Therefore C4 is false.

True.

Reasoning (discrete-time trace):

- t0: event2 happens.
- Because ""after event2, event1 must happen"", t1: event1 happens.
- Because ""after event1 no other events can happen"", for t ≥ 2 no events happen.

Now evaluate formulas (interpreting C1 as the state formula event1 → event2, and Cn as temporal combinations):

- C1 (event1 → event2) is true at t0 (antecedent false), false at t1 (event1 true, event2 false), and true for all t ≥ 2 (antecedent false).
- C2 = F C1 (eventually C1): true at every time (at t0 it already holds, at t1 it holds at t2, at t2 it holds immediately).
- C3 = X C2 (C2 holds in the next state): at t0 this asks whether C2 holds at t1 — yes, so C3 is true at t0.
- C4 = X X C2 (C3 holds in the next state): at t0 this asks whether C2 holds at t2 — yes, so C4 is true at t0.

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur next).
- After event2, no further events occur (the run terminates).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (a universal claim about runs)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., it is not the case that event1 always happens)
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" (antecedent: event1 occurs; consequent: C1 is false)
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" (antecedent: C3 is true; consequent: event2 occurs)

4) How they relate — truth evaluation
- From the context we know event1 does occur in this run. The context does not establish that event1 ""always"" happens in every possible run, so C1 is not supported (treat C1 as false or at least not provable). Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) holds.
- Since event1 happens and C2 holds, the implication in C3 is true (its antecedent and consequent are both true), so C3 holds.
- Given C3 holds and the transition rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (and event1 did happen), event2 does happen. Thus the implication in C4 has a true antecedent and a true consequent, so C4 is true.

(Also note: even under the alternative that C1 somehow were true, C3 would be false and then C4 would be vacuously true. So under the given context C4 is true in any case.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Brief justification: In the given run event1 occurs and by the transition rule event2 must follow, so event2 does occur. C2 (¬C1) holds because C1 (""event1 always happens"") is not established; thus C3 (""if event1 then C2"") is true (antecedent and consequent true). With C3 true and event2 true, the implication C4 (""if C3 then event2"") has a true antecedent and true consequent, so C4 is true. (If C3 were false, C4 would be vacuously true.)"

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially (at the start of observation).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.

Given event2 already happened initially and is terminal, no events can occur after that, so event1 cannot occur at or after the initial moment.

(If you allowed events before the “initial” moment, there is a caveat: event1 could have happened in the past before the initial event2. But under the usual reading that the initial state is the start of the timeline, event1 does not happen.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 happens OR event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds OR event2 happens (redundant given C1 includes event2).
- C3: C2 eventually holds (there exists some time now or in the future when C2 is true).
- C4: event1 happens AND C3 holds.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- event2 is true (it happened initially); event1 is false (it cannot happen after the terminal event2, under the usual interpretation).
- C1 is true (because event2 is true).
- C2 is true (C1 is true, and/or event2).
- C3 is true because C2 already holds now, so “eventually” is satisfied.
- C4 requires event1 to be true AND C3 true. C3 is true but event1 is false, so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Answers, step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is given that initially event1 happened).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- Because event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just event1 (a redundant disjunction). Since event1 did happen, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — an implication. With C1 true and C2 true, the implication C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — the negation of C3.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C4?
- C1 is true, C2 is true → C3 (C1 → C2) is true.
- C4 is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.

Final answer: C4 is False.

False

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (system is terminal).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).
- Because event2 already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state and no further states/events are possible.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant statement of event2; C1 is true in the initial state because event2 happened.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false in the initial (and all future) situation.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That asks whether there is some state now or in the future where C2 is true. Since C2 is false now and no further states can occur (because we are terminal), C2 will never become true, so C3 is false.
  (If you use the usual temporal logic notion of ""eventually"" that allows the current state, the conclusion is the same: C2 is false now and never becomes true; so C3 is false.)
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" This requires a successor state where C3 is true. There is no next state (the system is terminal), so C4 is false. (Under standard temporal semantics, X φ is false at a state with no successor.)

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- C1 true ⇒ C2 false ⇒ C3 false ⇒ C4 false.
- Therefore C4 is False.

Answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events — including event2 — can occur afterwards).
- Rule B: After event2 happens, event1 must happen (i.e. if event2 occurs then event1 must occur as required by the specification).

(If you wonder about ambiguity: whether ""after event2, event1 must happen"" means event1 must occur later than event2 or simply must occur at some time — either reading gives the same outcome here, because event1 already happened initially, and rule A prevents any later events.)

3) What each condition means?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires that event2 occurs and event1 eventually happens. C1 does hold, but event2 cannot occur (because event1 already happened and Rule A forbids any further events), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" This is an implication. Since event1 does happen (true antecedent), C3 is true only if C2 is true. But C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" This is a conjunction of (event1 happened) and (C3). Event1 happened (true) but C3 is false, so the conjunction is false.

4) How they relate / final evaluation:
- From initial event1 and Rule A, event2 is impossible.
- Therefore: C1 = True, C2 = False, C3 = False, and C4 = False.

So C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 is true initially, and Rule A forbids any further events so event2 cannot occur. Hence C2 is false, C3 (""if event1 then C2"") is false (true antecedent, false consequent), so C4 (event1 and C3) is false."

Short answer: C4 is False, under the natural reading below.

Now step-by-step.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial state: event1 happened (and event2 did not happen at that same initial state).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
So the system alternates: time0: event1; time1: event2; time2: event1; etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpretation used)
- C1: (event1 → event2) evaluated in the current state (a state-level implication).
- C2: same as C1 (the statement is identical).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — i.e., next-state satisfies (event1 → event2).
- C4: C1 ∧ C3.

(If instead C1/C2 were intended as temporal “if event1 happens then eventually event2 happens”, the evaluation changes; I cover that at the end.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- At the initial state: event1 is true and event2 is false. So the implication event1 → event2 is false (true antecedent, false consequent). Therefore C1 is False. C2 is the same, so C2 is False in the initial state.
- In the next state: event2 is true and event1 is false. There the implication event1 → event2 is true (antecedent false → implication true). So C2 holds in the next state, hence C3 is True.
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 = False ∧ True = False.

Conclusion: C4 is False under the usual state-implication reading.

Note on the alternative reading: if C1 and C2 were meant as temporal obligations “whenever event1 occurs, event2 will (eventually) occur afterwards,” then those would be true given the alternating rule, C3 would then also be true in the next state, and C4 would be True. The result depends on whether the implication is a same-state implication (as assumed above) or a temporal/eventual implication.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event2 has happened.
- Additional global rule: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred (and it already has in s0), no future state can have any event occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Because event2 has already happened in s0 and no events can happen after event2, there are no transitions that produce event1 at any time. In other words, event1 never occurs in any state of the execution starting from the given initial state.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here except that it is vacuously satisfied: it places a requirement only if event1 occurs, but event1 does not occur in this trace.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Logically this is the same as ""event1 happens"" (the repetition is redundant). C1 is true in a state exactly when event1 occurs in that state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as the temporal (globally) operator, C2 means: in every state of the trace, C1 holds. So C2 would require event1 to hold in every state.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" So C3 is true in a state only if event1 happens in that state and, in addition, C1 holds in all states (i.e., event1 holds everywhere).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C4 is true iff in the immediate successor state of the current state, C3 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values here?
- Because event2 already occurred in the initial state and no events can happen afterward, event1 never occurs in any state of the trace.
- Therefore:
  - C1 is false in every state (event1 never happens).
  - C2 (""always C1"") is false (C1 is not true in every state).
  - C3 (C1 and C2) is false (both conjuncts are false).
  - C4 (next C3) is false because the next state does not satisfy C3.

So C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Since event2 already occurred and prevents any further events, event1 never occurs in any state. Therefore C1 is false everywhere, C2 (always C1) is false, C3 (C1 and C2) is false, and so C4 (next C3) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (initially event1 happened).

Step 2 — transition/temporal rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This says that if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur (at some point after event2). Either way, it requires event1 to occur in any trace that contains event2.

Given that event1 already happened initially and that no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to just ""event1 happens."" So C1 is true (because event1 did happen initially).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true exactly when event2 happens.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens and (event2 happens and event1 happens)"" — logically equivalent to ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" So C4 is true exactly when both event1 and event2 happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value of C4
- We know event1 happened, so C1 and C2 are true.
- But because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot happen. Therefore C3 is false (event2 does not happen).
- Consequently C4 (which requires event2 as well) is false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the start) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, the run has no further events.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" => event2 is also terminal.
- Since the initial state is already after event1, the system is in a terminal state and no further events can occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (from the initial state forward).
- C2: same as C1 (redundant).
- C3: C1 and C2 hold — i.e. both claims that event2 eventually happens (still just one claim, repeated).
- C4: ""Eventually C3 holds"" — there will be some future point where C3 is true.

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because we start after event1 and no further events can occur, event2 cannot occur in the future. So C1 is false (and thus C2 is false).
- C3 (C1 and C2) is false.
- C4 (""eventually C3"") is false because there is no future point where C3 becomes true.

Note on ambiguity: If one instead allowed event2 to have already occurred prior to the ""initial"" moment, semantics might change; but under the natural reading given (initially event1 happened and thereafter no events can happen), C4 is definitely false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial time). No other events have happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, it must be followed by event2).

Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time (it cannot occur before the initial time because the statement gives the initial history as “event2 happened”; and it cannot occur after because nothing can happen after event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens” (same as C2 below; the repetition is redundant).
- C2: “Event1 happens” (identical to C1).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds” — i.e. eventually event1 will hold (event1 occurs at some future time).
- C4: “C1 holds or C3 holds” — i.e. either event1 holds now (C1) or event1 will hold eventually (C3).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since event2 already happened and no further events can occur, event1 does not hold now and will never hold.
- Therefore C1 = false, C2 = false, C3 = false.
- C4 = C1 or C3 = false or false = false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (it occurs at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal (nothing occurs after it).

So the actual run contains event2 and then event1, then stops.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the run above both events occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally this is event1 → (event1 ∨ event2). This implication is always true whenever event1 happens (indeed it is a logical tautology: p → (p ∨ q)). In the given scenario event1 does happen, and that implies C1 holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 does hold, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" That asserts that (at all times) C2 does not hold — equivalently C2 never holds. But we have already that C2 does hold, so C3 does not hold, hence C4 is false.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C2 is true (indeed tautologically true), so C3 is false, and therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

Answer up front: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event2 has happened (we start in/after an event2 state).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, then a subsequent state must include event2.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (event2 is terminal; once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: event1 happens in the next state. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 and C2 (so C3 holds iff event1 happens in the next state).
- C4: C3 always holds (C3 is true in every state, i.e. globally).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- We start after an occurrence of event2. By Rule B, after event2 no other events can happen, so in the next state event1 cannot occur. Therefore C1 is false (and so is C2), hence C3 is false.
- Since C3 is already false at this (next) state, it is not true “always.” Thus C4 is false.

Concise conclusion: C4 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: we start after event2 and Rule B forbids any further events, so event1 cannot occur in the next state (C1 and C2 false), making C3 false and therefore C4 (that C3 always holds) false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 has occurred initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
So both events are terminal: if either occurs, it prevents any further events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (¬event1)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Formally: event1 ∨ C1. Since C1 is ¬event1, C2 is event1 ∨ ¬event1, which is a tautology (always true).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Formally: event1 ∧ C2. Because C2 is always true, C3 is equivalent to event1.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" I.e., C3 is true at all times / in the given situation.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows from the initial scenario?
- From the initial condition (event2 happened) and ""after event2 no other events can happen"", event1 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2 is a tautology, so C2 is true.
- C3 requires event1 to happen; but event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4 claims C3 always holds; since C3 is false in the actual situation, C4 is false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent occurrences of any events.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event2 requires that event1 occurs afterwards).

Combining A and the initial condition: because event1 has already happened initially, Rule A blocks any further events from happening at any later time. So event2 can never occur after the initial state. There is no earlier time before the initial state for event2 to have happened, given the initial-state description.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — both events occur somewhere on the timeline.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — in all states (everywhere along the timeline) the conjunction C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — at some future state, C3 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event2 cannot occur (initial event1 forbids any further events), C1 is false (the ""event2 happens"" part fails).
- If C1 is false, C2 (""always C1"") is false.
- If C2 is false in every state, then C3 (C2 true in the next state) is false.
- If C3 is never true, then C4 (""eventually C3"") is false.

Therefore C4 is False. (Edge case note: even if you consider absence of a next state, that does not make C4 become true; the timeline does not allow event2, so the chain C1→C2→C3→C4 cannot be satisfied.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step‑by‑step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (so the proposition ""event1 happens"" is true at the start).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""must happen"" as logical implication)
- After event2, event1 must happen → event2 implies event1 (event2 → event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen → event1 implies event2 (event1 → event2).
Together these mean event1 and event2 imply each other; since event1 holds initially, event2 must occur (and then event1 again, etc.).

3) Meaning of C1–C4 and their truth values
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened and event1 → event2, event2 does happen, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is ¬C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 does happen, so the implication C2 → event1 is true; thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is ¬C3; since C3 is true, C4 is false.

4) Relation among the conditions
- C2 = ¬C1.
- C3 = (C2 → event1).
- C4 = ¬C3.
- Evaluating with event1 true yields: C1 = False → C2 = True → C3 = True → C4 = False.

Therefore C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the initial moment. (We assume there is no earlier moment when event1 could have happened.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so it simplifies to ""event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., at every point in time C1 is true (equivalently: event1 holds at every time).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — nesting of ""always""; if C2 fails at any time then C3 fails.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — further nesting; truth propagates upward.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 does not occur at any time in the timeline (under the natural reading).
- Therefore C1 (""event1 happens"") is false.
- If C1 is false, then ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false, hence C3 and C4 are also false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

(If you intended a different reading — for example C1 was meant to be ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" instead of repeating event1, or if ""always"" is intended in a different state-based way — the answer could change. Tell me if you want me to evaluate those alternative readings.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 does happen.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal.)

From these, event2 does occur (following event1).

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" This is true only if both C2 and C3 are true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 and C3 are identical and both false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (we are in the state after event2).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- So from the initial state (after event2) there are no successors — no further events can occur.

(Assumption used: a claim ""happens in the next state"" is false if there is no next state, as in standard linear-time semantics.)

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (This asks whether there is a successor state where event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (This asks whether, at the successor state, C1 would be true — which effectively refers to event1 happening two steps ahead.)
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" (Both must be true in the current state.)
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" (Logical OR of C3 and the proposition ""event1 happens"" in the current state.)

4) How these conditions relate and truth values given the context
- Since we start in the state after event2 and event2 is terminal, there is no next state. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (no next state in which event1 could happen).
  - C2 is false (it refers to C1 holding in the next state; there is no next state).
  - C3 is false (requires event1 and C2; event1 does not happen and C2 is false).
  - C4 = (C3) or (event1 happens) = false or false = False.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state S0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens in a state, then event2 must happen in the next state.
- If event2 happens in a state, then event1 must happen in the next state.

So the system forces alternation: after event2 comes event1, after event1 comes event2, etc.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (interpreting “next state” relative to the initial state S0)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (i.e. in S1).
- C2: “Event2 happens (now, in S0) and C1 holds.”
- C3: same as C1: “Event2 happens in the next state (S1).”
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At S0: event2 holds (given).
- By the transition rule “after event2 → event1”, at S1 event1 holds, so event2 does NOT hold in S1.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C2 = (event2 at S0) AND C1 = True AND False = False.
- C3 = same as C1 = False.
- C4 = C2 AND C3 = False AND False = False.

Conclusion: C4 is False. (If you instead evaluated these conditions at a different starting state—e.g. a state where event1 just happened—C1/C3 could be true, but given the stated initial condition they are false.)

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 occurs, event2 will occur at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Given the initial event1, the run is: event1 occurs, then at some later time event2 occurs, and then nothing else happens.

3) Meaning of each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (Implication: any occurrence of event2 is accompanied by an occurrence of event1.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (At some time in the future (or already) the statement C1 is true.)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" (Either C1 becomes true at some point, or event1 occurs.)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (Negation of C3.)

4) How they relate and truth values
- C1 is true in this scenario: event2 does occur but only after event1, so there is no occurrence of event2 without event1; hence the implication holds.
- C2 is true because C1 already holds (so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied immediately).
- C3 is true because event1 already happened (and also because C2 is true) — the disjunction is true.
- C4 says C3 does not hold, but since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 = False.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial moment).
- Additional facts: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So each event, if it occurs, leads to a terminal situation with no further events.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs, the system becomes terminal: no further events (so event2 cannot occur later).
- If event2 occurs, likewise the system becomes terminal: no further events.
- Since event1 already happened initially, we are already in a terminal situation and no further events can occur.

3) What each sub-condition means (interpreting “happens” as “occurs at the current moment”)
- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” At the initial moment event1 does happen, so C1 is True now.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” The next state has no events occurring (because event1 made the system terminal), so neither event1 nor event2 “happens” in that next state. Therefore C1 is False in the next state, so C2 is False.
- C3: “Event1 happens or C2 holds.” At the initial moment event1 happens, so C3 is True (true regardless of C2).
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 is True, C4 is False.

4) How the conditions relate
- Evaluated at the initial moment: C1 = True, C2 = False, C3 = True, C4 = False.
- Thus C4 is False.

(If instead “happened” were read as a persistent past-tense proposition that remains true after the moment it occurred, the truth values could change for C2; under the usual reading of “happens” as “occurs at the state,” the answer above applies.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: At the initial moment event1 happens, so C1 is true. Because event1 makes the system terminal, in the next state no events happen, so C2 is false. Therefore C3 (event1 happens or C2) is true (due to event1 at the initial moment), and C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false."

Short answer: C4 is False (under the natural interpretation that ""after"" means ""in the next state"").

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happened (event1 is true at the initial state). Nothing says event2 is true initially.

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — interpret as: if event2 is true now, then event1 is true in the next state (Next(event1)).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpret as: if event1 is true now, then event2 is true in the next state (Next(event2)).
So the rules make the two events alternate: event1 at time t implies event2 at time t+1, which implies event1 at t+2, and so on.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — trivial duplication; C1 ≡ event2 (i.e., event2 is true in the current state).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 ≡ event2, C2 ≡ event2 as well (still: event2 is true now).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this is Next(event2): event2 will be true in the next state.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — this is Next(event2) → event2 (if event2 will be true next, then event2 is true now).

4) How they relate; evaluation of C4
- From the transition rules and the initial condition:
  - Time 0: event1 = true, event2 = false.
  - By ""after event1, event2 must happen"": Time 1: event2 = true.
  - So at time 0, Next(event2) is true (C3 holds at time 0), but event2 is false at time 0.
- Therefore Next(event2) → event2 is false at time 0, so C4 is false.

Note: If you had a different semantics for ""after"" (e.g., ""after"" could allow the two events to be true simultaneously), conclusions could differ. Under the standard ""next-state"" reading used above, C4 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Interpreting ""after"" as next-state, C4 is Next(event2) → event2. At time 0 event1 is true and event2 false, and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" gives Next(event2) true at time 0. So Next(event2) is true while event2 is false, making the implication false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (the system is terminal after event1).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (terminal after event2).
Given the initial condition (event1 already happened), the system is already in a terminal situation and no further events can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Next-state occurrence of event2.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (At some future time, C1 is true.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (In every state from now on, C2 is true.)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" (At some future time, C3 becomes true.)

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluate here?
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 can never occur in any future state. Therefore C1 is false now and will remain false.
- If C1 never becomes true, then ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also false.
- Since C2 is false now and will remain false, ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is false.
- If C3 never becomes true, then ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is false.

Therefore C4 is False. (Same conclusion under the usual temporal semantics; if you used an alternate semantics where ""next"" is undefined rather than false, the result still supports that event2 cannot occur and so C4 does not hold.)

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event1 happened.
- Additional rules: both event1 and event2 are terminal — after event1 happens no further events can happen, and likewise after event2 happens no further events can happen.
(Assumption: “happens” is evaluated relative to a particular state — e.g. “event1 happens in this state.”)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Because event1 has happened in the initial state and event1 is terminal, no events can occur in any subsequent state reachable from that initial state. (Similarly if event2 had happened it would also be terminal, but here event2 has not happened initially.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “event1 happens or event2 happens.” — true in the initial state, because event1 happened there.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” — since C1 is true and event1 happens in the initial state, C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” — this asks whether C2 is true in the state immediately after the initial state.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” — the negation of C3.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Evaluate C3: In the next state no events can happen (because event1 was terminal). Therefore event1 does not happen in the next state, so C2 is false in the next state. Hence C3 is false.
- Therefore C4 (“C3 does not hold”) is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

(If instead “happens” were interpreted as “has happened at any time up to now” rather than “happens in the current state,” the evaluation might differ; the above uses the standard state-wise reading.)

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 occurs initially (at time t0).

2) Transition rules
- After any occurrence of E2, E1 must occur (so next step must be E1).
- After any occurrence of E1, E2 must occur.
- Together with the initial E2 this forces an infinite alternation: E2, E1, E2, E1, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally E2 → E2. In classical logic this is a tautology (always true): an implication p→p is true for every valuation.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it holds at every time; therefore C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 holds, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether there exists some future time at which C3 is true. Since C3 is false at all times (it contradicts the true C2), there is no such time; so C4 is false.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- C1 is always true, so C2 is true. C3 asserts the opposite of C2 and is therefore always false. C4 claims C3 becomes true sometime, which does not happen. Therefore C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Global rules: after event2, no other events can happen; after event1, event2 must happen.

(Implicit assumption used below: the timeline starts at the initial moment, so the only event that has happened at or after the start is the initial event2. No unspecified “earlier” events are assumed.)

2) Transition rules between events
- event2 is terminal: once event2 has happened, nothing else can happen afterwards.
- event1 implies event2 afterward: if event1 occurs, then event2 must occur after it.

Given the initial event2, the terminal rule means no event1 can occur after that initial event2. Under our assumption there are no earlier events, so event1 does not occur at all.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: “event2 happens or event1 happens.” This is true if at least one of event2 or event1 happens.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” Negation of C1.
- C3: “event1 happens or C2 holds.” True if event1 happens, or if C1 is false.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” Means C3 is true (at the relevant times) in all situations/times considered.

4) How they relate and truth values
- Since initially event2 happened, the disjunction in C1 is true (event2 happens). So C1 = True.
- Therefore C2 = (C1 does not hold) = False.
- C3 = (event1 happens or C2 holds). We have event1 does not happen (no events after event2) and C2 is False, so C3 = False.
- C4 asserts C3 always holds. But C3 is already false in the scenario above, so C4 is False.

Conclusion: C4 is False (given the stated initial condition and rules).

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step answers to your four questions

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event1 happened.
- Additional facts: after event1, no other events can happen; after event2, no other events can happen.

2) Transition rules between events
- The rules mean: once event1 occurs the execution reaches a state where no further events occur; similarly, once event2 occurs there are no further events. So at most one of these events can ever occur in a run, and in this scenario event1 has already occurred initially. Therefore event2 never occurs in this run.

3) What each sub-condition means (using standard temporal operators)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — read as G(event2): event2 is true at every time instant (or equivalently “event2 occurs in every state”).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — G(C1) (which is equivalent to G(G(event2)) and thus equivalent to G(event2) under standard linear-time semantics).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — X(C2): at the next state C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — G(C3): in every state, X(C2) holds.

4) How the conditions relate and the final truth value
- Because event1 already happened at the initial state and that prevents any further events, event2 is false in the initial state and at all future states. So C1 (G(event2)) is false.
- If C1 is false, then C2 = G(C1) is false, C3 = X(C2) is false, and C4 = G(C3) is false.
- Therefore C4 is False.

(If you use a different reading of ""always happens"" — for example, “event2 eventually happens in every run” — the same conclusion holds here because the initial event1 blocks any occurrence of event2. )

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has occurred initially and prevents any further events, so event2 never holds. Thus C1 (event2 always) is false, hence C2, C3 and therefore C4 are all false."

Short answer: C4 is False (under the usual reading that ""Event2 always happens"" means ""Event2 holds at every state"").

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Two atomic events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initially (at time 0) event1 happened (E1 true at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After E1, E2 must hold in the next state.
- After E2, E1 must hold in the next state.
Hence the system alternates: t0: E1, t1: E2, t2: E1, t3: E2, … forever.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions (formalized)
Interpreting the natural-language Ci in temporal logic:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" ≡ G E2 (E2 holds at every state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ X C1.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ F C2.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" ≡ G C3.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- C1 (G E2) is false at time 0 because E1 holds at t0 (so E2 is not true at every state).
- C2 (X C1) is false at time 0 because at t1 the trace does not have E2 at every later time (t2 is E1, etc.). More generally, there is never a state after which E2 holds at every future state, so C2 is false at every time.
- Since C2 is never true, C3 (F C2) is false (there is no time when C2 becomes true).
- Therefore C4 (G C3) is false.

(If instead the intended meaning of C1 was ""E2 occurs infinitely often"" — i.e. GF E2 — then the answers change and C4 would be true. But under the usual reading of ""always happens"" = ""always (globally) holds"", C4 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event2 has happened. From that, event1 must occur next.
- So C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true in the initial state.
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is true because in that next state event1 holds (so ""eventually event1"" is satisfied there).
- After event1 no further events can happen, so the state after that has no successor; any ""next"" formula evaluated there is false. Thus C2 does not hold in the next state of the next state, so C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is false.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"", hence C4 is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. at the start of the timeline, event1 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from the state where event1 has happened, event2 will eventually occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (i.e. in any execution where event2 occurs, event1 occurs as well — here we can take this to mean event1 has occurred at some point in that execution.)
- C2: identical to C1.
- C3: C1 or C2 (a disjunction of two identical statements, so C3 is equivalent to C1).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" (i.e. ¬C3).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Because the initial condition says event1 happened, every execution already contains event1. Therefore any occurrence of event2 in that execution is an execution that contains event1. So C1 is true (and hence C2 true).
- Since C1 is true, C3 (C1 or C2) is true.
- C4 is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Two event types: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 happened (i.e. the trace starts with event2 already occurring).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, no event1 can occur anywhere on the trace.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (there exists some future point where event1 occurs)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (a material implication: if event1 eventually happens, then event1 happens — interpreted as an implication from the proposition C1 to the proposition ‘event1 happens’)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (negation of C2)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (C3 is true at all times; here effectively: C3 is true)

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because event2 already happened and prevents any further events, event1 never happens → C1 is false.
- A material implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 (C1 → event1) is true.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.
- Hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

So C4 is False.

(If you intended a different reading of the implication in C2 — e.g. a temporal/non‑material implication — say so and I can re-evaluate under that semantics.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (e1) and event2 (e2).
- Initial condition: event2 happens (e2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. In propositional form: if e2 then e1 (c1: e2 → e1).
- After event1, no other events can happen — this restricts what can occur after e1 but does not contradict that e2 already happened before e1.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (c1 = e2 → e1.)
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens. (c2 = c1 ∧ e2.)
- C3: If event1 happens, then C2 holds. (c3 = e1 → c2.)
- C4: C3 does not hold. (c4 = ¬c3.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- We know e2 is true and the rule c1 (e2 → e1) is given, so c1 is true.
- Therefore c2 = c1 ∧ e2 is true (true ∧ true).
- c2 is true regardless of whether e1 actually happens; a conditional whose consequent is already true is itself true. Thus c3 = e1 → c2 is true because its consequent (c2) is true.
- Since c3 is true, c4 = ¬c3 is false.

Summary answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (at the initial state).

(Assumption: events are discrete and not simultaneous — i.e., “happens” means an event occurs at some state/time, and “after X” refers to later states. If you allow simultaneous occurrence the result can change; I’ll proceed with the usual sequential interpretation.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen in the next step (if event2 occurs, the next state must have event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens” — i.e., both events occur (in the relevant/global/current run).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — the conjunction in C1 is true in the state following the current one.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — C2 is false.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” — C3 is false (double negation of C2).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the initial condition and Rule A: because event1 happened initially, no other events can happen afterwards. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any later state. Hence C1 (both event1 and event2 happen) is false.
- If C1 is false now, then C1 cannot suddenly become true in the next state either (there are no allowed further events after event1), so C2 is false.
- C3 says “C2 does not hold”; since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4 says “C3 does not hold”; since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False (under the stated sequential/non-simultaneous event assumption).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (initially).
- Additional facts: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So each event, if it occurs, is terminal (no further events can occur afterward).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur after that. There is no information that event1 happened before or simultaneously with event2; given the statement ""Initially, event2 happened,"" the natural reading is that only event2 has occurred. Thus event1 did not occur.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — requires both events to have happened.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — logically (A or (A and B)) = A, so C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C3: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — same as C1.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" — conjunct of C2 and C3. Substituting, C4 is equivalent to ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (same as C1/C3).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth values
- From the initial conditions: event2 is true, event1 is false.
- Therefore:
  - C1 = (event2 ∧ event1) = false.
  - C2 = event2 = true.
  - C3 = (event2 ∧ event1) = false.
  - C4 = C2 ∧ C3 = true ∧ false = false.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.
- Also: after event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen — both events are terminal: once either has happened, no further events occur.

2) Transition rules
- If event2 has happened, the system does not allow any subsequent event in later states.
- If event1 has happened, likewise no subsequent event can occur.
- So from the initial state (where event2 happened) there is no state in which event1 will occur later.

3) What each sub-condition means (evaluated at the initial state unless otherwise noted)
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" In the initial state this is True because event2 happened.
- C2: ""event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is True in the initial state, C2 is True in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must look at the next state after the initial one. Because event2 was terminal, in the next state neither event1 nor event2 occurs, so C1 is False in that next state, hence C2 is False in that next state. Therefore C3 is False (it is not the case that C2 holds in the next state).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" Both conjuncts fail in the initial state: C3 is False, and event1 does not happen (only event2 did). So C4 is False.

4) Relation and conclusion
- The chain C1 → C2 holds in the initial state, but C3 requires that C2 hold in the successor state, which fails because no further events occur after the initial terminal event2. Therefore C4 (which needs C3 and event1) is False. 

(If one instead interpreted ""event2 happened"" as a persistent proposition that remains true in all later states, the evaluation of C3 could change. With the usual interpretation that events are instantaneous and do not persist, the conclusion above stands.)

- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 would be terminal).

Because event1 has already happened and it forbids any further events, event2 cannot happen.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false, because event1 did happen initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event1 never happens at any time). This is false because event1 did happen.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Since event1 happens, C3 is true (true ∨ anything = true).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C3 is true, but event2 does not (and cannot) happen. An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false. So C4 is false.

4) How the conditions relate:
- The actual occurrence of event1 makes C1 and C2 false, makes C3 true, and because event2 cannot occur after event1, the implication in C4 fails. Therefore C4 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 did happen, so C3 is true; but event2 cannot occur after event1, so the implication ""if C3 then event2"" is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so at the start event1 is true/occurs).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen: that is, event1 ⇒ event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen: event2 ⇒ event1.
So both implications hold; the system alternates (event1 ↔ event2, in effect).

Step 3 — meaning and truth of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This restates the given rule event1 ⇒ event2, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and whether C4 holds
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" (i.e., C2 ⇒ C3).
- In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Here C2 is false and C3 is true, so C2 ⇒ C3 is true.
- Therefore C4 is True.

Summary of truth values: C1 = True, C2 = False, C3 = True, C4 = True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false. In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 ⇒ C3 is true."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).
Because event2 already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state and no further events (including event1) can occur.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬E2).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" (E1 ∧ ¬E2).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F(C2) — C2 is true at some time now or in the future).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F(C3)).

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- Since event2 happened initially, E2 is true. Therefore C1 (¬E2) is false.
- C2 requires both E1 and ¬E2. ¬E2 is false, and additionally event1 cannot occur after event2 (terminal), so C2 is false and can never become true.
- C3 asserts that C2 will be true at some time. But C2 can never become true, so C3 is false.
- C4 asserts that C3 will be true at some time. Since C3 is never true, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False"
