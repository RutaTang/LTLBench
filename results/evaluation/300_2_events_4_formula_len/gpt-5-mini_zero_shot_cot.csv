Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false.

2. Examine the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
   - C2: ""Event2 always happens."" (identical to C1)
   - C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" So C3 is of the form P -> P where P is ""Event2 always happens.""

3. A statement of the form P -> P is a tautology in classical logic: it is true in every case (true->true is true; false->false is true; false->true is true). Therefore C3 always holds.

4. Since C3 always holds, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True."

Step 2 — facts from the context

- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore there is no next state after the initial state (no further events/transitions).
- (After event2 no other events can happen is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.)

C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because there is no next state after the initial state, C3 is false (the ""next"" condition cannot be satisfied).

- C4 is the formula ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" (i.e., C1 → C3). We must decide whether this implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event2 occurred; whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen afterward; whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterward. So event1 and event2 force each other to occur indefinitely after they first appear.
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: same as C1 (also ""event2 happens in the next state"").
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some (current or future) state where C2 is true.
- Thus C4 is ""If event2 happens in the next state (now), then eventually there is a state where event2 happens in the next state.""

Step 3 — reason through it
- If C1 holds in the current state, then C2 holds in the current state (they are identical).
- ""Eventually"" includes the present (standard temporal logic semantics), so if C2 holds now, then C2 holds eventually. Hence C3 holds.
- Even under a stricter reading of ""eventually"" as strictly future: if C1 holds now then event2 occurs in the next state; from the context, after that event2 there will be event1 and then event2 again, so there will be a future state whose immediate successor has event2 — so C2 holds at some future state, so C3 still holds.

Conclusion
- The implication C1 → C3 (C4) is True.

- C3 says ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds now, it certainly holds at some time (immediately), so ""eventually C2"" is true. (In standard temporal semantics, ""eventually"" allows the current moment.)

- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened; ""After event2, event1 must happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So event2 → eventually event1, and event1 → eventually event2, giving an alternating sequence starting from the initial event2.
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Equivalent to ""after event2, event1 must happen"".)
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Same as C1.)
- C3: C1 and C2 both hold. (Redundant conjunction of the same fact.)
- C4: C3 eventually holds.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- The context directly enforces C1 (and hence C2). They are true from the start because after any event2 an event1 will follow.
- Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) holds immediately.
- If C3 holds immediately, then ""C3 eventually holds"" is also true.

Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given (1) and (3), event2 has already happened at the initial point and no events can occur after event2. There is no information that event1 occurred before that initial state, so event1 cannot occur in any continuation. Therefore C1 is false.

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 asks whether ""C3 always holds"", i.e. at every timepoint the proposition C3 is true.

Step 2 — understand conditions and semantics
Interpret ""eventually"" as the temporal F (some future time) and ""always"" as G (for all future times). The context gives:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- G(event1 -> F event2) : after any event1, event2 must eventually occur.
- G(event2 -> F event1) : after any event2, event1 must eventually occur.
These imply an infinite alternation of event1 and event2 (no infinite stalling where the required future event never happens).

Step 3 — examine each hypothesis condition
C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True from the initial event1 by G(event1 -> F event2).
C2: ""C1 always holds"" = G(F event2). From the alternation rules, from any point in time you will see an event2 eventually (if the next event is event1 then F event2 follows immediately; if the next event is event2 then after that event1 and then event2 will occur). So G(F event2) holds — C2 is true.
C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 holds globally, the disjunction is true at every time.
C4: ""C3 always holds"" = G(C3). Because C2 holds globally, C3 is true at every time, so C4 holds.

- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds""): event2 did happen (initially), but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 is false.

- After event1, no other events can happen (not needed here).

Evaluate the conditions step by step:

- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Event2 does happen, but C1 is false, so this implication is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does happen.
- C1 (“Event1 happens and event1 happens”) is just a redundant conjunction and so is true (event1 happens).
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 is “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 is false (and never becomes true given event1 does occur), C3 is false.
- C4 is “C3 holds or event1 happens.” Event1 does happen, so C4 is true regardless of C3.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context:
  - Initially (call this state S0) event1 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen — so in the next state S1, event2 occurs.
  - After event2, no other events can happen — S1 is terminal (no further eventful successor).
- Conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (a property of a given state)

  - C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" (in any state with event1, C3 must be true)

Step 3 — trace and reason
- At S0: event1 happened. By context, at S1 event2 happens. So C1 is true at S0 (event2 does happen in the next state of S0).
- At S1: event2 happens, but by context no other events can happen after S1, so in S1 the next state does not have event2. Thus C1 is false at S1.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (because C1 fails at S1).
- C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is evaluated at S1: event2 does happen at S1, but C2 is false, so the implication is false at S1. Hence C3 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The hypothesis C4 is ""C3 eventually holds.""
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event1 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" → ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" → ""In every state, Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" → ""There is some point from which, in every state thereafter, Event1 happens in the next state.""

Now use the context timeline:
- Initially event2 happened (call that state s0).
- After event2, event1 must happen, so event1 happens at the next state s1.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so from s2 onward no events occur.

Evaluate the formulas on this trace:
- At s0: C2 is true because event1 occurs at s1.
- At s1: C2 is false because at s2 no events occur, so ""Event1 happens in the next state"" is false.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false at s1 (and thus cannot be true globally).
- There is no later state from which C2 holds in every subsequent state (event1 occurs only once at s1), so there is no point from which C3 becomes true forever.

Thus C3 never becomes true eventually, so C4 is false."

Examine the context:

- After event2, no other events can happen. (So event1 cannot occur after event2.)

Examine the conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. Because event2 has already happened and prevents any further events, event1 indeed does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens. This requires event1 to both not happen (C1) and happen, which is impossible. Also event1 cannot happen after event2. So C2 is false.

- C3: C1 and C2 (so equivalently, event1 happens in the next state).
- C4: if C3 holds, then event2 happens.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- Since initially event2 happened, the requirement ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur in the next state. Therefore C1 and C2 are satisfied, so C3 holds.
- Given event1 occurs, the requirement ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur (in the following state).

Reasoning step by step

1) Identify the question
- We must evaluate C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"" given the context and the other conditions.

2) Understand the context and rules
- Initially event2 has happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen -> from the initial event2, event1 will (eventually) happen.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen -> once event1 occurs, event2 will occur again, and so on. The rules force at least one occurrence of event1 (and thereafter an alternation), so event1 will happen at some time.

3) Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True: event2 already happened initially and event1 will happen, so both occur at some times.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False: at times before event1 has occurred, C1 is false (so it is not true at all times).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True, because C2 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" True because C3 holds (and independently event1 also happens).

2) Interpret the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur after it.

3) Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, and there is no indication event2 happened before the initial event1, so event2 does not happen. Thus C1 is false.
   - C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — requires event2 to happen and event1 to happen. Event1 did happen initially, but event2 did not, so C2 is false.
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication whose antecedent (C2) is false, hence the implication is vacuously true. Therefore C3 already holds (at the initial point).

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Model the execution:
   - s0: initial state, event2 has just happened.
   - s1: after s0, event1 happens (it must).
   - There is no further state after s1 (after event1 no other events can happen).

2. Evaluate C1 (""event1 eventually happens""):
   - At s0: true, because event1 happens at s1.
   - At s1: true as well, because ""eventually"" includes the current state (event1 holds at s1).

3. Evaluate C2 (""C1 always holds""):
   - C1 is true at every state (s0 and s1), so C2 is true.

4. Evaluate C3 (""C2 always holds""):
   - C2 is true at every state, so C3 is true.

5. Evaluate C4 (""C3 holds in the next state""):
   - From s0 the next state is s1, and C3 holds at s1, so C4 is true.

Therefore the hypothesis C4 is True."

- Because event2 happened initially, event2 indeed happens (right away). Thus C1 is true.
- C2 is the same statement as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3 says that C2 eventually holds. Since C2 already holds (it is true from the start), C2 holds at some time (immediately), so ""C2 eventually holds"" is true. Therefore C3 is true.
- Given C1 is true and C3 is true, the implication ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" is true.

1. Initial facts: in the initial state event2 has happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (so the state after event2 is terminal). After event1 no other events can happen as well (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur initially).

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the initial state event1 does not happen, so this implication is vacuously true there. Thus C1 holds in the initial state.

3. C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Both conjuncts are true in the initial state (C1 true; event2 happened), so C2 is true in the initial state.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state: after event2 no other events can happen, so the state with event2 is terminal and has no successor. Therefore the ""next"" condition is false (there is no successor state where C2 could hold). So C3 is false in the initial state and cannot become true later because there are no later states.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. We must decide whether ""C4: C3 eventually holds"" is true given the context.
2. C1 says ""event1 happens in the next state."" But the context says event1 happened initially and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore no event (including event1) can happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
3. C2 is ""always C1"" — since C1 is already false (at the next state), C2 is false.
4. C3 is ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false: C2 is false, and event2 never happens because after event1 no events can occur. So C3 is false (everywhere).
5. C4 is ""eventually C3."" Since C3 never becomes true, C4 is false.

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. (Interpretation: immediately after an occurrence of event2, event1 must occur in the next state.)
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., globally, event1 never happens).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state it is still true that event1 never happens).
- C4: C3 does not hold.

Step 3 — Reasoning with the context:
Since initially event2 happened and ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" in the next state event1 must occur. That directly contradicts C2 (which says event1 never happens). Therefore C2 is false in the next state, so C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.

C3 is false, so ""C3 does not hold"" (C4) is true.

2. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is logically trivial: event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2) is always true. In any state where event1 holds this implication is true, and in states where event1 does not hold it is vacuously true. So C2 holds in every state.

- C4: C2 → C3, i.e. (¬C1) → C1.

- The context says: event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. Therefore event1 will eventually happen, so C1 is true.
- If C1 is true, then C2 (¬C1) is false and C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. event1 does not happen in the next state)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" (C2 ∨ event2)
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" (event2 → C3)

Step 3 — evaluate
- In any state where event2 holds, C3 = (C2 ∨ event2) is automatically true because event2 ⇒ (event2 ∨ C2). In propositional logic A → (A ∨ B) is a tautology.
- Therefore whenever event2 happens the consequent C3 is true, so the implication in C4 is true in every state where event2 holds; and vacuously true in states where event2 does not hold.

C4 is True."

- Start state: event2 happened.
- From the context: after event2, event1 must happen next; after event1, no further events occur. So the next state (after the initial one) is a state where event1 happens.
- C1 is the formula ""event1 -> event1"", which is a tautology and holds in any state.
- C2 asserts ""always C1""; since C1 is true at every state, C2 is true.
- C3 is ""event1 or C2"". Because C2 is true, C3 holds in every state (and certainly in the next state).
- C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state"". As argued, C3 does hold in the next state (both because C2 is global and because event1 holds in the next state).

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initially event2 happened, and the context says ""after event2, no other events can happen."" That makes event2 a terminal event: once it has happened, event1 can never occur at any later point. Therefore ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is true.

2. Since no events occur after event2, the same fact (event1 does not happen) is true in the next state as well. So C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is true.

3. C3 asserts that C2 eventually holds. Because C2 already holds (immediately), C3 is true.

4. C4 asserts that C3 eventually holds. Because C3 already holds, C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True."

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Model the system: initial state S0 where event2 has happened; because “after event2 no other events can happen” S0 has no successor states.
- C1 (""if event1 happens then event2 happens"") is true at S0 (the antecedent is false, so the implication holds vacuously).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, since the only reachable state is S0 where C1 holds.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false at S0 because there is no next state, so a “next” requirement is not satisfied.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is therefore false, because C3 does not hold at the initial state.

So C4 is False."

C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" So we must decide whether at some future state there is a state where C3 is true. C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"", and C1/C2 both assert ""event2 happens in the next state"". So C4 asks: at some future state, will the very next state contain event2?

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially (time t0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at some later state after t0 there will be event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so after that event1 there will be event2).
Hence the system forces an alternating sequence: event2 (t0), then event1 (t1), then event2 (t2), then event1 (t3), etc.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and check C3:
At t1 we have event1, and at the next state t2 we have event2. Thus at t1, ""event2 happens in the next state"" is true, so C1 (and C2) are true at t1, hence C3 is true at t1.

Step 4 — conclude about C4:
Because there exists a future state (t1) where C3 is true, ""eventually C3"" holds.

Step 2 — consequences of the context

C4 says “C3 always holds.” We must decide whether C4 is true given the described behaviour of events.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” This is a material implication p → p, which is a tautology; it is true in any state (whether event2 holds or not).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Since C1 is true in every state, C1 certainly holds in the next state of any state; so C2 is true in every state (assuming the next state exists).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Because C2 is true immediately (in the next state) for every state, there certainly exists a future state where C2 holds; thus C3 is true in every state.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” Since C3 is true at every state, C4 is true.

Step 3 — trace event sequence (to check assumptions)
The system alternates: initial state S0 has event2, then S1 has event1, then S2 has event2, etc. There are next states at each step, so the “next state” modality is well-defined. The tautologous nature of C1 makes the alternation irrelevant to truth of C1–C4.

- C4 says: ""C3 always holds."" So we must decide whether, given the context, the statement C3 is true in every relevant situation (i.e., whether C3 holds, and does so always).

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (and it has, initially), no further events can occur anywhere thereafter.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This just says event2 would be terminal if it occurred.)
- Combining these: since event1 occurs initially and after event1 nothing else can happen, event2 cannot occur at any point in any trace consistent with the context.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 never happens in any allowed trace, C1 is true (vacuously true). Also, event1 did happen initially, so even if one imagined event2, event1 would already have happened.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true as well.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" C1 does hold and C2 holds, so the implication C3 is true. (More generally, because C2 is true, C3 is true regardless of C1.)

The question asks whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the initial facts and rules.

Step 2 — given facts / rules
- Initially, event1 happened (so ""event1 happens"" is true right now).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 guarantees a later event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 guarantees a later event1).
These rules produce an alternating sequence: event1 (already happened), then event2, then event1, etc.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because the initial event1 forces event2 to occur later.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" True, since C1 is true and event1 already happened initially.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True — C2 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some time (immediately).

- C4 is the formula: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds.""
- So we must decide whether (C1 → C3) is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
- Propositions:
  - C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
  - C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" i.e. ""event2 does not happen at some (future or current) time.""

Step 3 — reason about the system
- From the context, event2 does happen initially, so C1 is false in the actual trace.
- Also, because after event2 no other events can happen, all subsequent times have no events, so at those times ""event2 does not happen"" is true; therefore C3 is actually true in the real trace (C2 holds at the next moment, so C3 holds).
- More generally, even if you ignore the actual context: if C1 were true (i.e. event2 does not happen), then C2 is true immediately (they are the same), hence C3 (""event2 does not happen eventually"") would certainly hold. So the implication C1 → C3 holds in any case.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is being asked
- We must determine whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C3.

2. Interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (event1 is true at the start).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event2 will occur at some later point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3. Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" The context only guarantees event1 at the initial time, not at all times. Moreover, since event2 must occur later and is terminal (no events after it), event1 cannot hold at all times (it cannot occur after event2). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false, even though event2 does happen.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is never true at any time, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

4. Conclusion
- C4 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The question asks whether C4 (C2 and C3) is true given the context.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and so is true in any state where it is evaluated. C3 is identical to C1, so C3 is true in the current (initial) state.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" For C2 to be true there must be a next state in which C1 holds. But the context says: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. That means there is no successor/next state after the initial state. Under the standard semantics of the next operator (which requires a successor state), Xφ (or ""φ in the next state"") is false when there is no next state. Therefore C2 is false.

- C4 is C2 and C3. Since C2 is false and C3 is true, C4 is false.

Thus the final answer is False."

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once the initial event1 has occurred, nothing else (including event2) can happen.
- Therefore event2 never happens at any point.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just event2 happens. Since event2 never happens, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is false at the initial state (and forever), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — this is ¬C2. Because C2 is false, C3 is true (already true at the initial state).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 is true now, it holds eventually (eventually including the present). So C4 is true.

We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context. Evaluate everything starting from the initial state.

Step 2 — formalize the context and timeline
- At time t0 (initial): event1 happened (given).
- The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force the events to alternate. So the timeline is:
  - t0: event1
  - t1: event2
  - t2: event1
  - t3: event2
  - ... and so on.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state t0
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" At t0, event1 is true but event2 is not, so C1 is false at t0.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" At t0 this implication is true because C1 is false (false → anything is true).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Check t1: at t1 event2 is true, event1 is false, so C1 is false at t1, so C2 (C1 → event2) is true at t1. Therefore C3 is true at t0.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" At t0 we have event1 true, and we also established C3 true. So the disjunction is true.

Examine the conditions:
- Context: state0 (initial) has event1. Also, once event1 occurs, no other events can happen in any later state. And if event2 happens at some point then event1 must happen afterward (this will not be relevant if event2 never occurs).
- C1: (event1 → event1). This is a propositional tautology, so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: (C1 → event1). Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is equivalent to event1 (i.e., C2 holds exactly in states where event1 holds).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — so C3 at a given state means event1 holds in the next state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — means at every state the next state must have event1.

Trace the timeline:
- state0: event1 holds (given). So C1 true, C2 true at state0. But after event1, no other events can happen, so in state1 and all later states event1 does not hold.
- state1: event1 is false, so C2 is false in state1. Therefore C3 is false in state0 (because C3 at state0 requires C2 in state1), and C3 is also false in state1 (requires C2 in state2, which is false), etc.

1) Context summary
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus the only actual execution is the initial occurrence of event2 and then termination; event1 never occurs.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 holds (indeed it holds in every state).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds, C2 entails that event2 happens. In the given context event2 did happen (initially), so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" There is only the initial state (where event2 happened) and then no further states; C2 holds in that state, so C2 holds in all reachable states. Therefore C3 holds.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate events
- The context says: initially event2 happened. So event2 is true at the start.
- The context also says: after event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 already happened initially, no later events (including event1) can occur after that.
- Therefore event1 does not happen at any time (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and there is no earlier time to place it).
- Hence C1 and C2 are false (they require event1). C3 is false (C2 never eventually holds).

You are asked whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context and the conditions
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after the initial one contains event2). After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: event1 happens in the next state (same as C1).
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens (i.e., event1-next or event2).
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition in light of the context
- Given the context, the next state after the initial event1 contains event2 (event2 must happen). So event1 does not happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false, and C2 is false.
- Event2 does happen in the next state, so C3 (""C2 or event2"") is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is the implication C1 → C3. In the actual situation C1 is false and C3 is true, so the implication is true.
- More generally, even if C1 were somehow true, C2 would then be true and thus C3 (C2 or event2) would be true, so the implication would still hold.

Step 1 — restate the conditions

C1 and C2 are syntactically identical, so C1 → C2 is a tautology (p → p). A tautology is true immediately, so C3 holds now (and therefore “eventually”).

We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the scenario:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there is no next state after the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (A → A), so C1 is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asserts the next-state operator X(C1). For X(C1) to be true in the current state there must be a next state and C1 must hold there.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This is X(X(C1)) and therefore requires two successive next states.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This asserts G(C3) — C3 must hold in every state along the trace (including the initial state).

Step 3 — use the event/trace information
Because after event1 no other events can happen, the initial state (where event1 has happened) has no next state. Under the usual semantics where Xϕ is false when there is no next state, X(C1) (i.e. C2) is false in the initial state. Hence:

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context, at the initial state (state 0) event2 happened.
- The constraints only force that after any event2 there will be some later event1, and that once event1 happens no further events occur. They do not force an event2 in the next state.
- C1 (event2 in the next state) is therefore not guaranteed. C2 and C3, which depend on C1, are not guaranteed either.
- C4 is the disjunction “Event2 happens or C3 holds.” Evaluated at the initial state, the left disjunct “Event2 happens” is true (because event2 happened initially), so the whole disjunction is true.

- We must decide whether C4 holds given the system description. C4 is ""eventually (eventually (eventually (eventually (next event2))))"" (i.e. four nested ""eventually"" around ""event2 happens in the next state"").

Step 2 — understand the system
- Initially event1 happened (call this state s0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the state s1 immediately after s0, event2 holds).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so s2 has event1), and then s3 has event2, etc.
- Thus the states alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate each condition at the initial state
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state""): at s0 the next state s1 has event2, so C1 is true at s0.
- C2 (""eventually C1""): since C1 already holds at s0, C2 is true at s0.
- C3 (""eventually C2""): C2 holds now, so C3 is true.
- C4 (""eventually C3""): C3 holds now, so C4 is true.

(Also note: nested ""eventually"" operators collapse — F F … F φ is equivalent to F φ — and here C1 already holds immediately, so all nested eventualities are satisfied.)

- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, a later state must have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences afterwards).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this just means event1 happens (C1 is true exactly when event1 happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — requires that event1 happens in the immediate next state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — requires that C1 holds two steps ahead, i.e. event1 happens two steps ahead.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state from which two steps later event1 happens.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- event1 has already happened initially. By ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no further events (including any subsequent occurrence of event1 or any event2) can occur in any later state.
- Therefore there is no next state in which event1 happens. So C2 is false in the initial state.
- If C2 is false in every state, then C3 is false in every state, so there is no future state where C3 holds.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context facts:
   - Initially, event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 will occur afterwards).

2. Evaluate C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
   - Given the context statement ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" C1 is true (whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur).

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 eventually holds.""
   - Since C1 is already true from the start, C1 holds now, so ""eventually C1"" is true. Thus C2 holds.

4. Evaluate C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds.""
   - Event1 happened initially, and C2 holds, so C3 is true in the initial state.

5. Evaluate C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
   - After event1 occurred, no other events can happen. In the next state there is no new occurrence of event1 (the occurrence was at the initial state and cannot repeat), so the conjunct ""Event1 happens"" is false in the next state. C2 (that C1 eventually holds) remains true, but because the ""Event1 happens"" part fails, C3 is false in the next state.
   - Therefore C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So there is no state after the initial state in which any event occurs (in particular there is no meaningful next state where events happen).

- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is therefore false (there is no next state where event1 can happen).

- C2 (""if C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is an implication with a false antecedent, so C2 is true (vacuously true).

- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") requires a next state where C2 is true. Since there is no next state, C3 is false.

- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") asserts that C3 holds now or at some future state. C3 does not hold now and there are no future states where it could hold, so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The context forces an alternating sequence starting with event2: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false — event2 does not hold in the event1 states.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"". Since C1 is false, C2 is true exactly in states where event2 holds (i.e., every other state).
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"", so C3 holds exactly in the states where event2 does not hold (the event1 states).
- C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state"". From the initial state (event2), the next state is an event1 state, so C3 does hold there.

C4 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context rules.

Step 2 — restate the context rules
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds = (event2 happens) AND (event1 does not happen).
- C3: Event1 does not happen (same as C1).
- C4: C2 OR C3 = (event2 happens AND event1 does not happen) OR (event1 does not happen).

Logical simplification: C4 is equivalent to (event1 does not happen). (Because (A and B) OR B = B.)

Step 4 — trace the sequence
Event2 happened initially. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (at least at some point after that initial event2). Therefore ""event1 does not happen"" is false.

Step 5 — conclusion
Since C4 is equivalent to ""event1 does not happen"", and that is false given the rules, C4 is False.

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because the system enforces the alternating sequence indefinitely, at every step either event1 or event2 occurs, so C1 holds at every step — thus C2 is true.

- Initially event2 happened (event2 is true at the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen — irrelevant unless event1 actually occurs (no occurrence of event1 is given).

- C3 requires event2 to hold at all times; but event2 is only guaranteed at the initial state, so C3 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: event2 happens initially, and both “after event1, no other events can happen” and “after event2, no other events can happen.” So occurrence of event2 prevents any other events from occurring afterward (and since it happens initially there is no opportunity for event1 to occur later).

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" Given event2 happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is true, but the consequent (C2) is false, so the implication C3 is false.

Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 says: eventually C3 holds. C3 says: C2 always holds. C2 is: if event1 happens, then C1 holds. C1 is: event2 happens or event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1 is the disjunction (event1 or event2).
- C2 is the implication: event1 -> (event1 or event2). But for any proposition A and B, A -> (A or B) is a logical tautology. So C2 is true at every time it is evaluated.
- C3 says C2 always holds. Since C2 is a tautology, C3 is true (C2 does indeed hold at every time).
- C4 says C3 eventually holds. If a property holds at all times (C3 true now and forever), then in particular it holds at some future time — so C4 is true.

Step 3 — role of the context
- The given temporal constraints (initially event2, each event forces the other later) are consistent with the above and do not invalidate the tautological inference that C2 always holds.

- We must decide truth of C4 given the scenario. C4 is “C3 eventually holds.”

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially (at time 0) event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event2 occurs at time 0 and nothing happens later.
- The “after event1, event2 must happen” constraint is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is equivalent to “event2 happens.” Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true (holds at time 0).
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” C1 is equivalent to event2, so C2 is the implication event2 → event2, which is true (it holds at time 0, in fact it’s tautologically true whenever evaluated).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” C2 already holds now (time 0), so there is some time (namely now) at which C2 holds; therefore “eventually C2” is true — C3 holds.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” C3 holds now, so “eventually C3” is true (holds at time 0).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C4 is true.

Step 1 — what is given about events
- Initially, event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus the only possible event sequence is: event1 happens (initially), then event2 happens, then nothing else.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3 under that sequence
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Both occur in the sequence, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, and C1 is true, so the implication holds; C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 holds (true), and event1 does happen, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds (from the start), so it certainly holds at some time (hence ""eventually"" true).

Examine the context and conditions:

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as at all times (i.e., in every state), this is false: after event2 occurs, no further events (including event1) can happen, so event1 does not hold at all times.
- C2: same as C1, so also false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is the implication P -> P (same proposition on both sides). An implication of the form P -> P is a tautology: it is true regardless of whether P (here C1) is true or false. So C3 is true (it holds immediately).

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given that event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is true.

3. C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since event2 did happen initially and C1 is true, C2 is true (and it holds immediately).

1) What is being asked
- We must decide if C4 (that C3 holds at all times) can be true given the context.

2) Understand the context and the Ci
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, it must be followed by event1.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 occurs, no further events—including event2—can occur afterward.)
- Hypothesis pieces:
  - C1: event1 happens and event1 happens. (Equivalent to: event1 happens.) Given the context, C1 is true (initial event1).
  - C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens. With C1 true, this is just restating event1 — true.
  - C3: event2 happens and C2 holds. This requires event2 to happen (and C2, which is true).
  - C4: C3 always holds. Means C3 is true at all times.

3) Trace the event sequence / apply the rules
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore event2 does not happen.
- Thus C3 (which requires event2) is false.

4) Conclusion about C4
- C3 is false, so it cannot ""always hold."" Therefore C4 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: C4 asserts ""C3 holds in the next state"", where C3 = ""eventually C2"", C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"", and C1 = ""event2 happens and event1 happens"". So we must check whether, given the context, C4 can be true.

2. Use the context constraints:
   - Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
   - After event1, no other events can happen — therefore in every successor state after the state where event1 has happened no events (in particular no event2) can occur.
   - After event2, event1 must happen — this only adds constraint if event2 actually occurs.

3. Consequences for C1–C4:
   - Because event1 already happened initially and that forbids any later events, event2 cannot occur at any later state. Even if one allows simultaneous occurrence at the initial state, the next state (after the initial one) cannot have event2 (or any other event).
   - C1 requires a state where both event2 and event1 hold. That can at best be true only at the initial state if simultaneity were allowed; but C2 requires C1 to hold in the next state. The next state cannot have event2 (by ""after event1 no other events can happen""), so C2 is false.
   - If C2 is false then ""eventually C2"" (C3) is false (there is no future state where C2 becomes true).
   - If C3 is false, then C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is also false.

Therefore C4 is False."

You are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the initial time event2 occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (If event1 ever happens, the system stops afterward.)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Since event2 happened initially, the system stops afterward.)
- Read ""Event1 always happens"" as the temporal formula G(event1) — i.e., event1 holds at every point in the execution.
- Read ""always holds"" as the outer G operator, and ""eventually holds"" as F.

Step 3 — reason through the trace(s)
Because event2 happens initially and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" there are no further events at any later time. In particular, event1 does not occur at the initial time and cannot occur later. So event1 never happens in the execution.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (G(event1)) — false (event1 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G(C1)) — false because C1 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — false for the same reason.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F(C3)) — false because C3 is never true at any time.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen (so the immediate next state after an event1 contains event2). After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after an event2 contains event1). Thus the events alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. not(C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" i.e. not(not(C1)) which is equivalent to C1 (so C3 ≡ C1).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" i.e. C1 holds in every state.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate the conditions
- At the initial state s0: event1 happened. By rule, the next state s1 must have event2, so C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false at s0. Hence C3 (equivalent to C1) is false at s0.
- At s1: the next state s2 must have event1, so C1 (and thus C3) is true at s1.
- So C3 is true at s1, false at s0, and alternates thereafter.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""event2 or event1"" — in every state of this trace one of the two holds, so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 already holds at s0, C2 is true at s0 (and in every state).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — this is an implication evaluated at a state: (C2) → (event1 at that same state). Because C2 is true at a state, C3 requires event1 to be true at that same state to make the implication true.

- Initially (state S0) event1 happened (so event1 is true in S0).
- “After event2, event1 must happen” has no effect here because event2 does not occur in S0.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means in the next state (S1) no events occur (so neither event1 nor event2 hold in S1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in S0 and S1
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” In S0 event2 does not hold, so C1 is false in S0 (and also false in S1).
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens. In S0 this is false ∨ true = true, so C2 is true in S0.
- C3: C2 does not hold. In S0 this is ¬true = false, so C3 is false in S0.
- Now look at the next state S1: after event1 no events occur, so event1 is false in S1 and event2 is false in S1.
  - C1 is false in S1.
  - C2 = C1 ∨ event1 = false ∨ false = false in S1.

Examine conditions:

  Together these mean once we start (event2 has happened), no further events can occur at any later time.
- Context 2: After event1, event2 must happen. (This is irrelevant if event1 never occurs, and it cannot force event1 to occur.)

Interpret the Cs:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C3: Event1 eventually happens. (C3 is identical to C1.)
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds. This requires event1 to happen (C1 is then redundant).

Trace possible event sequences:
- At the initial moment event2 has already happened.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen at any future time.
- Therefore event1 never happens, so C1 and C3 are false, and C2 (which requires event1) is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event1 happened. The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred (and it has, initially), no further events can occur at any later time.  
- Therefore event2 can never occur at any time (there is no moment after the initial event1 at which event2 could happen). So C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"" / F event2) is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"" / G F event2) requires C1 to hold at every time; since C1 is already false initially, C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"" / F G F event2) is false because C2 never becomes true.

- C2: same, simplifies to: Event1 happens.
- C3: C1 and C2 → Event1 happens (since both are the same).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" → it asserts that Event1 happens (holds) at all times.

Step 2 — what the context says about events
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus, once the initial event2 has occurred, no occurrence of event1 can occur afterward. Since event2 already happened initially, event1 does not happen anywhere in the timeline.

Step 3 — combine them
- C3 (Event1 happens) is false in the given scenario.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Interpret ""eventually"" in the usual sense (true if it holds now or at some later time).
2. From the context: event2 happened initially. Therefore C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true.
3. C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is true, C2 is true (disjunction).
4. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". Because C2 already holds now, C3 is true.
5. C4 is ""C3 does not hold"", i.e. the negation of C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Step 1 — identify the target
- We must decide if C4 is true given the context and the conditions C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- C1: Event2 does not happen. (¬E2)
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. Formally E2 → C1. Since C1 is ¬E2, C2 is E2 → ¬E2, which is logically equivalent to ¬E2. So C2 asserts ¬E2.
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens. Formally C2 ∧ E2. But since C2 is ¬E2, C3 is ¬E2 ∧ E2, a contradiction (always false).
- C4: C3 always holds. That claims the contradictory C3 is true at all times.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context says: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. That makes E2 impossible after the initial event1, supporting ¬E2 (C1/C2).
- Either way, C3 requires E2 to be true while C2 implies ¬E2, so C3 is inconsistent with itself and with the context.

Conclusion
- C3 is false (contradictory), so it cannot ""always hold."" Therefore C4 is False.

Reasoning step by step:

- Let S0 be the initial state (where event2 happened). The rules say: after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So the states go S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, ...

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Evaluated at S0 this asserts event1 at S1. That is true.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Evaluated at S0 this asserts that at S1, C1 is true (i.e., event1 will happen at S2). But at S2 we have event2 (because after event1 at S1 comes event2), so C1 does not hold at S1. Thus C2 is false at S0.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" As a conditional evaluated at S0 this is true, because its antecedent C2 is false (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Interpreting ""Event1 happens"" as the same temporal claim as C1 (event1 in the next state), we have C1 true and C3 true at S0, so their conjunction C4 is true.

- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds"" (there is some future state where C3 is true). We must decide whether C4 is true given the event rules.

Step 2 — the event rules and the timeline
- Initially (state s0): event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → so s1 has event2.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → so s2 has event1.
- Thus the system alternates: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ... (event2 occurs at s1, s3, s5, …).

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C3 at states (interpret ""happens"" as ""happens in the current state"")
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - At s0, C1 is true (s1 has event2).
  - At any state with event2 now (s1, s3, …), the next state has event1, so C1 is false there.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (both evaluated at the same state)
  - For C2 to be true at a state, that state must have event2 now AND that state's C1 must hold (i.e., next state has event2).
  - At states with event2 now (s1, s3, …), the next state is event1, so C1 is false → C2 is false everywhere.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens.""
  - Since C2 never holds at any state, C3 never holds.

- We must decide whether C4 (which is “C2 holds and C3 holds”) is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After any event2, an event1 must happen.
- After any event1, an event2 must happen.
- Starting from the initial event2, these rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … continuing indefinitely.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1 / C3: “Event1 always happens.” Given the forced alternating sequence, event1 occurs after each event2 and thus occurs repeatedly (infinitely often). Therefore the claim that event1 always happens is satisfied. (C1 and C3 are the same, so C3 holds.)
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” Whenever event2 happens, the rules force event1 to follow and continue alternating thereafter, so the global property “event1 always happens” is true whenever event2 occurs. Thus C2 holds.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Both C2 and C3 hold, so C4 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step, with the usual next/always temporal reading):

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is true given the scenario (""after event2, event1 must happen"").

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At the initial state, the next state is the one where event1 will occur, so C1 does hold in that next state — C2 is true at the initial state.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Interpreting this as a conditional evaluated at the same state (i.e. if C1 holds in the next state, then event1 must happen now), at the initial state C2 is true but event1 does not happen in the initial state (it happens in the next state). So C3 is false at the initial state.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 fails already at the initial state, C4 is false."

Step-by-step reasoning
1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (always true in any state where the implication is evaluated). So C1 holds.

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds, C2 reduces to the claim ""event2 happens."" So C2 holds exactly in states where event2 happens.

3. Context: initially event2 happened. Thus C2 holds in the initial state.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must check the next state after the initial one.
   - The context says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means there is no subsequent state with further events, or at least event2 cannot occur in any successor.
   - Either there is no next state at all (so a ""next"" claim is false), or there is a next state but event2 does not happen there (so C2 is false there because it asserts event2 happens).
   - In either interpretation, C2 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C3 is false.

5. C4 states ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

- C1: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” This is true in s0 (event1 happened and event2 follows) and also holds vacuously in any state where event1 does not hold.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” We need to check C1 in s1. In s1 event1 is false and event2 is true, so the implication of C1 is true in s1. Therefore C2 is true in s0.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since we just found C2 is true, C3 is false in s0.

- In particular, event2 never happens in any reachable state (there are no subsequent states where it could happen).

- C1 and C2 require event2 to happen; since event2 never happens, C1 and C2 are false in all reachable states.
- C3 requires a next state in which event2 holds. But there is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so C3 is false.

- From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 cannot occur).
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". True (given).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — true because C1 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — true because C2 holds.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" The antecedent C3 does hold (true). The consequent ""event1 happens"" is false because event2 happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, so event1 cannot happen.

Since the implication has a true antecedent and a false consequent, C4 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context timeline:
- Initially event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, no further events, and event2 is not true there).

2. Evaluate the conditions at states:
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". At the initial state this is true (event2 did happen), so C1 holds there.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — at the initial state this is false (because C1 holds). But after event1 occurs, event2 is no longer true, so C1 is false there and C2 becomes true in that later state.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — this implication is true in any state where C2 is false (vacuously true). At the initial state C3 is true (since C2 is false). But at the state after event1, C2 is true while event2 is false, so C3 is false there.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — this requires C3 to be true in all states. Because we found a reachable state (after event1) where C3 is false, C4 is not always true.

Therefore C4 is False."

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpret the system:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After any event1, event2 must happen.
- After any event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the system enforces an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

2. Unpack the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — redundant; effectively C1 is true exactly at those times when event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1) — asserts event2 holds at every time point.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G C2) — equivalent to G C1 (G G φ = G φ), so same meaning as C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3) — there is some time after which C1 holds at every subsequent time (i.e., from some point on event2 holds at every time).

3. Evaluate possibility:
Because events alternate, there will always be times when event1 occurs (and thus event2 does not hold at those times). Therefore it is impossible that from some time onward event2 holds at every time. So C2/C3 are false, and C3 will never become true at any future time, so C4 is false.

- Interpreting ""Event1 always happens"" as a statement that Event1 holds at all times (i.e., in every state/time point of the execution) — the usual reading of “always”/“globally.”

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, Event1 happened (so Event1 holds at the initial time).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so the next step contains Event2).
- After Event2, no other events can happen (so once Event2 has happened, Event1 does not happen again later).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1 (Event1 always happens): false — Event1 holds initially but does not hold after Event2, so it is not true at all times.
- C2 is the same as C1, so false.
- C3 (C1 and C2): false (conjunction of two false statements).

- C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Understand the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event1 occurs (call that state s0). Rules force alternation: after any event1 the next state must have event2, and after any event2 the next state must have event1. So the states go s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … (alternating forever).
- Evaluate the Ci as state formulas (their truth depends on which state we evaluate them in):
  - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is true in states where the current state is event1 (because next is event2), and false in states where the current state is event2.
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is the negation of C1; it is true in states where the current state is event2, false where the current state is event1.
  - C3: ""C2 always holds."" This claims C2 is true in every state. But C2 is false in the event1 states, so C3 is false.
  - C4: ""C3 always holds."" This claims C3 is true in every state. Since C3 is already false (e.g., at s0), C4 is false.

Step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 happened. The rules force alternation: after event1, event2 must happen next; after event2, event1 must happen next. So starting from the initial state (where event1 happened), the next state must have event2 (not event1).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the rule above, this is false (the next state has event2).

3. C2: same as C1, so C2 is also false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Interpreting this at the initial point, the disjunction is (C2 is true) OR (event1 happened now). C2 is false, but event1 did happen initially, so C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" = false AND true = false.

- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 never happens.)

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true already at the initial time, it certainly holds at some (indeed every) future time. So C2 is true.

Reasoning:
- Let s0 be the initial state. In s0, event1 is true and, by ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" s0 is terminal (no successor states). Event2 never occurs in any state.
- C1 (event1 -> event2) is false in s0 because event1 is true and event2 is false.
- C2 (always C1) is false because C1 does not hold at s0.
- C3 (next C2) is false in s0 because there is no next state; under standard temporal semantics, X φ is false in a terminal state.

C4 says ""C3 does not hold."" We must determine whether that statement is true.

Step 2 — Understand the events
Initially event2 happens. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So the system produces at least: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → … — in particular, both event2 and event1 do occur.

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the sequence above, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is a global statement that both events happen at some point; since the situation ensures both events occur, C2 is true.

Step 1 — interpret the scenario
- Initial state: event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so in the next state event2 occurs.
- After event2, no other events can happen → there is no future event after the state where event2 happened.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
  True in the initial state because event2 must happen immediately after event1.

- C2: ""C1 always holds.""  
  This says that in every state, C1 holds (i.e., in every state the next state contains event2). That is false: in the state after event2 there is no next-event = event2 does not happen in the next state there, so C1 fails there. Therefore C2 is false.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""  
  Since C2 is false, C3 is true (C2 indeed does not hold).

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds.""  
  C3 already holds (it is true immediately), so it certainly holds eventually. Therefore C4 is true.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = NOT(C2) = ""Event1 does not happen."" (so C3 is equivalent to C1)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = ""Eventually (event1 does not happen).""

2) Use the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 does not happen"" (C1/C3) is false at the start; its negation (C2) is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That prevents any change that could make C1/C3 true later (for example, event1 already happened, so a statement ""event1 does not happen ever"" is permanently false). The rule about event2 is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1.

3) Therefore C3 is false now and will remain false; it never eventually becomes true. Hence C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false.

- C4 asserts: (Event1 happens now) AND (C3 holds).
- C3 asserts: C2 holds in the next state.
- C2 asserts: C1 does not hold (i.e. ¬C1).
- C1 asserts: Event2 happens (the duplicate ""and event2 happens"" is just Event2).

So C4 is equivalent to: Event1 now AND (in the next state ¬Event2).

Step 2 — the context constraints
- Initially Event1 happened (so Event1 holds now).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so in the next state after any Event1 state, Event2 holds).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (so states alternate Event1, Event2, Event1, ...).

Step 3 — combine them
- From the rules, since Event1 holds now, the next state must have Event2.
- But C4 requires the next state to satisfy ¬Event2.
- Therefore C4 requires Event2 and ¬Event2 to both hold in the next state, which is impossible.

C4 is the formula ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context rules:
  - Initially event1 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen (so from any occurrence of event1, some later event2 is required).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (so from any occurrence of event2, some later event1 is required).
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to simply ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — states that eventually event2 will happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. it is not true that eventually event2 happens.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"" — whenever event1 happens, it must be the case that C2 does not hold.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C1–C3
- From the context: event1 happened initially. From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we conclude event2 will happen at some later time. Thus event2 happens, so C1 is satisfied. Therefore C1 eventually holds, so C2 is true. Consequently C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 requires that whenever event1 happens, C3 holds. But event1 did happen initially (antecedent true) while C3 is false (consequent false). An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false. Therefore C4 is False.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 and C2 both assert ""Event1 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant), so C3 asserts that Event1 happens.
- Context says Event2 happened initially, and after Event2 no other events can happen. Therefore Event1 cannot occur at any time.
- Since Event1 does not happen, C3 is false, so it cannot ""always hold."" Hence C4 is false."

C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide if C3 is false (making C4 true) or C3 is true (making C4 false) given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs the trace ends.

Now the hypothesis conditions:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. True, because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds. Since event1 does happen (by the ""after event2"" rule) and C1 also holds, C2 is true.
- C3: Event1 happens or C2 holds. Event1 does happen, and C2 holds, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — conclusion about C4
C3 is true, therefore ""C3 does not hold"" is false.

- Initially event1 happened (so the system starts in a state where event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — there are no future events).
- The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur after the initial event1 (no events occur after event1), and event2 did not happen before the initial state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" On the actual (finite) trace we have — a single initial state where event1 happened and then nothing — event1 holds at every state of the trace. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is true and event1 does happen initially, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" On the single-state trace C2 holds at that state, so C2 holds at every state of the trace; therefore C3 is true.

  - State s0 (initial): event1 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen → s1: event2 happens.
  - After event2, no other events can happen → for all s2, s3, ... no events (so event1 is false at and after s2).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition along the timeline
- At s0: event1 is true, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2 at s0 asks whether C1 holds at s1. At s1 event2 happens and event1 does not, so C1 is true at s1 ⇒ C2 is true at s0.
- For s1: C2 at s1 asks whether C1 holds at s2. After event2 no events occur, so event1 is false at s2 ⇒ C2 true at s1.
- For every later state sx (x ≥ 0): the next state does not contain event1 (either because event2 already occurred and no further events occur, or because event1 was only at s0), so C2 is true at every state.
- Therefore C3 (that C2 always holds) is true.

- Whether C3 holds or not, the consequent of C4 (event2 happens) is already guaranteed by the context. Hence the implication ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" is true.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened, so event2 is true at the start.
- C1 = (event1 or event2) is therefore true (because event2 is true).
- C2 = (C1 or event2) is true as well (redundantly true because event2 is true).
- C3 = “C2 eventually holds” is true (it already holds at the initial time).
- C4 requires both “event1 happens” and C3.

C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether this is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event1 did not happen.)
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just ""event2 happens"" (a tautological repetition).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ""event2 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e. ""event2 does not happen"" holds at some future state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at the immediate next state, C3 is true.

Step 3 — reason about the timeline
- event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the system stays in a state where event2 has happened and there are no further states reachable by events.
- Therefore C1 (event2 happened) is true now and remains true; C2 (event2 does not happen) is false now and can never become true in any future state because there are no further events/states that would make it true.
- Consequently C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- C4 requires C3 to hold in the next state. There is no next state (no events can occur), and in any case C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Now examine the system and each condition:

- System behavior: Initially event2 happened (call that state 0). Rules force strict alternation: after event2 comes event1, after event1 comes event2. So event1 occurs exactly at states 1, 3, 5, ...; event2 at states 0, 2, 4, ...

- C1 (at a state n): ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — true iff state n+1 has event1. That holds exactly at even n (because event1 occurs at odd-numbered states).

- C2 (at state n): ""C1 holds in the next state"" — true iff C1 is true at n+1, i.e. iff n+1 is even, so C2 holds exactly at odd n.

- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this requires C2 to be true at every future state. But C2 is true only at odd states and false at even states, so there is no state from which C2 holds at every future state. Therefore C3 is false in every state.

- After event2, no other events can happen (so the state reached after event2 has no outgoing transitions where new events can occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, it is followed by event2).

Step 4 — trace and reason
- The initial state has event2 and, by ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" there are no subsequent states in which events occur. Thus event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no opportunity after the initial event2), so ""Event1 happens"" is false.

- C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Logically this is p → (p ∨ q), which is a tautology and thus true in any case; here both p (event1) and the disjunction are true, so C2 holds.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold,"" i.e. ¬C2. Since C2 holds, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer: False."

1) Identify the hypothesis: C4 asserts that C3 always holds, where C3 = (C1 and C2), and C1 and C2 both assert ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

2) Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has happened, no subsequent events—including event1—can occur.)
- Also: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (This is irrelevant because event1 can never occur if event2 already happened and prevents further events.)

3) Trace the sequence:
- Since initially event2 has happened and event2 prevents any further events, event1 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not happen next), and likewise C2 is false.
- Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is false in the current/next state.
- Because C3 is already false at (at least) the next state, C3 does not hold always.

- Initially event1 happened (so event1 has occurred at the start).

- After event2, event1 must happen — if event2 ever occurs, then a later occurrence of event1 is required.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, event1 already happened initially, but because no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is no opportunity for event2 to occur (and if event2 did occur, rule would require a later event1, which is impossible because no events can occur after event1).

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; once it occurs, the run ends).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens, so C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true at the initial state.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true at the initial state because C1 is true and event1 happens there.
- C3 (""event1 happens and C2 holds"") is also true at the initial state for the same reasons.
- C4 asserts that C3 holds in the next state.

- C3 is (event1 or C2). Since event1 holds initially, C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold"", which contradicts the established truth of C3; therefore C4 is false.

The question asks whether C4 (the formula ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""event2 or event2"" is just event2 (redundant).
- C2: ""C1 or event2"" is event2 (since C1 already is event2).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" is X event2 (i.e., event2 holds in the next state).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" is (X event2) -> event2 (if event2 will hold next, then event2 holds now).

Step 3 — trace the context
From the context: initially event1 happens (time 0). The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating trace:
time 0: event1
time 1: event2
time 2: event1
time 3: event2
... and so on.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 on that trace
At time 0, X event2 (C3) is true because event2 occurs at time 1. But event2 is not true at time 0. So (X event2) -> event2 is false at time 0. Thus C4 is not satisfied.

- C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens): true in the initial state (C1 true and event1 happened).

Step 3 — evaluate C3 (C2 holds in the next state)
C3 requires that there is a next state where C2 holds. But after event1 no other events can happen, so in the next state no event occurrence of event1 or event2 can happen. Therefore C2 (which requires event1 to happen) cannot hold in any next state. So C3 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Context facts:
   - Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true in every allowed scenario.
   - After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur (at least once) after the initial event1.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant for the implication evaluation here).

2. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event1 happened initially in every allowed scenario, any occurrence of event2 is preceded by (or at least accompanied by) event1. Thus C1 is true in the context.
   - C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.

3. Evaluate C3 and C4:
   - C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 (and C2) hold, C3 is true.
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts the fact that C3 is true, so C4 is false.

- We must decide whether C4 is true or false.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the immediately following state both events happen).
- C3: C2 does not hold (¬C2).
- C4: C3 does not hold (¬C3). Note ¬(¬C2) ≡ C2, so C4 is equivalent to C2.

Step 3 — use the context constraints
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur in any later state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 4 — evaluate the Cs
- C1 cannot hold in any later state because no events can occur after event1; in particular, C1 does not hold in the next state.
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is false.
- C3 = ¬C2 is true.
- C4 = ¬C3 is false (and as noted, C4 ≡ C2, which is false).

False"

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Since event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur after event2. It also cannot have occurred before (the statement says event2 happened initially), so event1 does not happen at any time. Therefore C1 and C3 (which claim event1 happens) are false. C2 is true because event2 does happen. C4 requires both C2 and C3 to be true, but C3 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Initially event2 happened. Therefore at the initial state C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true (because event2 happened).
2. From C1 being true, C2 (""event1 or C1"") is also true at the initial state.
3. C3 requires that C2 hold in the next state. But the context says that after event2 no other events can happen — there is no next state in which new events occur, and in any successor state neither event1 nor event2 can happen. Hence C2 does not hold in a next state (either there is no next state, in which case ""next"" formulas fail, or the next state has neither event and C2 is false).
4. Since C3 is false, C4 (""C3 holds and event1 happens"") is false (and in fact event1 never happens at any point).

Therefore C4 is False."

Step 1 — restate context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event2 cannot happen after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 does not occur).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False, because event1 did happen initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False, since C1 is false (it does not hold).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is false but event1 happens, so C3 is true (disjunction true).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 is true, but event2 does not happen (it is forbidden after event1), so the implication fails — C4 is false.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and after event1 no other events can happen).
- C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false and event1 cannot happen after event2, C2 is false (and cannot become true later).
- C3 asserts ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 can never hold (no further events can occur after the initial event2), C3 is false at all times.
- C4 asserts ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 never becomes true, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False."
