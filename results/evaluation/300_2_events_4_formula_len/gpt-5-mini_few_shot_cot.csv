4. C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" (C1 -> C2). Since C1 and C2 are syntactically the same formula, C1 -> C2 is a tautology (P -> P), which is true in every state regardless of whether P itself holds. Thus C3 is true.

3. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false at the initial state. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there is a future state (the very next state s1 = event1) where C2 is true (because from an event1 state the next state is event2). Thus C3 is true.

4. The implication C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This is true at the initial state (antecedent false, consequent true).

1. Initial state (state0): event1 is true, event2 is false.
2. From ""after event1, event2 must happen"", the next state (state1) has event2 true.
3. From ""after event2, no other events can happen"", all states from state1 onward have event2 true.

Now the formulas:

4. C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — as a state formula this is ¬event2. So
   - C1 is false at state0 (since event2 is false there, wait: careful — at state0 event2 is false, so ¬event2 is true). Actually correct this: at state0 event2 is false, so C1 holds at state0. But we must follow the chain below; better to evaluate consistently:

Let me re-evaluate cleanly:
- At state0: event2 is false → C1 (¬event2) is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1 = event2. So C2 is true exactly when event2 is true. At state0 C2 is false; at state1 C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = eventually(event2). From state0, event2 holds at state1, so C3 is true at state0. From state1, event2 already holds, so C3 is true at state1 as well.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = next(C3). We check C3 at state1: as just noted, C3 is true at state1. So C4 is true at the initial state.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 holds.
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
So the system alternates: event2 (time 0), event1 (time 1), event2 (time 2), event1 (time 3), ...

Hypotheses:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (same as a state implication event2 → event1)
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (duplicate of C1)
- C3: C1 and C2 (so equivalent to C1)
- C4: C3 eventually holds (there exists some state now or in the future where C3 is true)

Evaluate:
1. At time 0 (initial) event2 is true and event1 is false, so the state implication event2 → event1 is false there. Thus C1 (and C2, and C3) do not hold at time 0.
2. At time 1 the state is event1 (event2 is false). The implication event2 → event1 is true (antecedent false), so C1 and C2 both hold at time 1; hence C3 holds at time 1.
3. Therefore there exists a future state (time 1) where C3 holds, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

1. Context behavior: initially event1. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates forever: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" From the initial state (event1) the next state is event2, so C1 is true at the initial state. More generally, in the alternating run, event2 occurs infinitely often.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means at every state, event2 will occur at some future time. Consider any state:
   - If the current state is event1, event2 occurs next.
   - If the current state is event2, event1 occurs next and then event2 again.
So from every state event2 does occur later. Therefore C1 holds at every state, and C2 is true.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen → the system stays at event2 in the next and all future states (event2 holds forever).
- Event1 never occurs in any state.

Evaluate the formulas:

C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — false at the initial state (next state is event2, not event1), and false in every state.

C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., event2 -> X event1).
- In every state event2 is true, but X event1 is false, so the implication is false in every state. Thus C2 never holds.

C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" (i.e., C2 -> event1).
- Because C2 is false in every state, the implication C2 -> event1 is vacuously true in every state. So C3 already holds at the initial state (and in all states).

3. C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true in the initial state and in all subsequent states.

4. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at every state because C1 already holds (so it is satisfied immediately, hence eventually).

5. C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true because C2 holds at every state.

6. C4 (""C3 always holds"") is also true for the same reason (C3 holds at every state).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens."" So C1 is true exactly in states where event1 holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true (event1 occurs at state1).
3. C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is equivalent to ""event1 holds now"" (if event1 holds now then C1 is trivially true). So C2 is false at state0 and true at state1 and thereafter.

1. C1 is the state formula ""Event1 and Event2"" — both events true in the same state.

Therefore C1 is always false.

2. C2 is ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is always false, C2 is false.

3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 forever).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant since event2 never occurs here).

Evaluate the hypothesis:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just event2. In the initial (and all reachable) states event2 is false because we start at event1 and cannot leave it.

2. C2: C1 holds and event1 happens = (event2) AND (event1). There is no state where both event1 and event2 are true simultaneously, so C2 is false in every state.

3. C3: If C2 holds, then event1 happens = (C2 → event1). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true in every state (vacuously true since C2 never holds). In particular C3 holds in the initial state.

4. C4: C3 eventually holds. Because C3 already holds now, it certainly holds eventually.

Therefore C4 is True."

- From the context: s0 has event2. After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the (infinite) trace is:
  s0: event2
  s1: event1
  s2: event1
  ...

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True at s0 (event1 occurs at s1) and true at every s≥1 (event1 already holds). So C1 holds at every state.

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. at every state C1 is true). Since C1 is true at every state, C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is already a global property that holds at every state, so C3 is also true.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). The next state s1 satisfies C3 (as argued), so C4 is true at the initial state.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays in states where event2 holds forever).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Interpret the claims:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 eventually happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 eventually holds (i.e., at some future point, ""event2 eventually happens"" is true).
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds.

Reasoning:
1. At the initial state event2 already happened, so C1 is true now.
2. Because after event2 no other events can happen, event2 holds at all future states as well.
3. Therefore C2 (event2 eventually happens) is true at the initial state and at every future state.
4. C3 requires that at some future state C2 holds; since C2 holds immediately (and always), C3 is true.
5. C4 is the implication ""if C1 then C3"". C1 is true and C3 is true, so the implication is true.

1. From the context: initial state is event2, and the rules force an alternation: after event2 comes event1, after event1 comes event2, so the trace is event2, event1, event2, event1, ... . Thus event1 does occur (in the second and every odd state thereafter).

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false in any state where event1 occurs (in particular, it's false in the next state after the initial one).

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state event1 does not happen). This is false, because event1 does occur in some states.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this asserts that from the next state onward, C1 always holds. But the next state is an event1 state, so C1 is already false there; hence C2 is false in the next state, so C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is false, C4 is true.

2. Therefore every state (initial and all future states) has event1 true and event2 false.

3. Evaluate C1: ""event1 or event2"". Since event1 is true in every state, C1 is true in every state.

4. Evaluate C2: ""if event1 then C1"". Because event1 holds and C1 holds whenever event1 holds, the implication is true in every state (and would be vacuously true in states without event1).

5. C3: ""C2 always holds"". Since C2 holds in every state, C3 is true.

6. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"". Because C3 holds in every state, it also holds in the next state. Thus C4 is true.

- Evaluate C3 (""if event1 happens, then C2 holds""):
  - At an event1 state: the next state is event2, and in that next state event1 does not happen, so C1 holds there; hence C2 (C1 in the next state) is true. Thus the implication holds when event1 happens.
  - At an event2 state: the antecedent ""event1 happens"" is false, so the implication is true vacuously.
  - Therefore C3 is true at every state (holds globally).
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"". Since C3 already holds, C4 is true (regardless of whether event1 holds at the current state).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context yields a trace: initial state has event2; by “after event2, event1 must happen,” the next state is event1 and thereafter no other events can happen, so event1 holds from the next state onward.
2. C1 and C2 are the same formula: “If event2 happens, then event1 happens” (i.e., event2 -> event1).
3. C3 is “If C1 holds, then C2 holds” which is an implication of a formula to itself (C1 -> C1). Any formula implies itself, so C3 is true in every state (a tautology).
4. Therefore C3 already holds at the initial state (and everywhere), so “C3 eventually holds” is true.

7. From the context: initially event1 happened, and the system forces alternation (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1), so event1 does occur (now and repeatedly).
8. Therefore C1 is true, and thus C4 is true.

2. System behavior from the context: initially event2. After event2 → event1 must happen. After event1 → event2 must happen. So the states alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
3. At any state where event1 holds, the next state is event2, so C3 is true at every event1 state.
4. Starting from the initial state (event2), the next state is event1, and the following state is event2; thus at time 1 (the event1 state) C3 becomes true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context: initially event2 holds. After event2, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event2 forever; event1 never occurs at any future time.

2. Unpack the hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time t, C1(t) means event1 at t+1).
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → C2(t) = not C1(t) = not(event1 at t+1).
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" → C3(t) = C2(t+1) = not(event1 at t+2).
   - C4: ""C3 always holds"" → for every t, C3(t) must be true, i.e., for every t, event1 does not occur at t+2.

3. Since event1 never occurs (the system remains at event2 at all times), not(event1 at any time) is true. Therefore for every t, not(event1 at t+2) holds, so C3 holds at every time.

4. Hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True."

5. From step 3, C1 is false in every event2-state, so there is no state where both C1 and event2 hold. Therefore C2 is false in every state (always false).
6. C3 = (C2 does not hold) = ¬C2. Since C2 is always false, C3 is true in every state (always true).
7. C4 = (C3 always holds). Because C3 is true in every state, C4 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Reachable states: state0 = event1 (initial). From event1 the next state must be event2, and after that it stays at event2 forever. So sequence: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event2, ...

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At state0 the next state is state1 which is event2, so C1 is false at state0. In fact C1 is false in every state (there is no state whose next state is event1).

- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false everywhere.

- C3 = (C2) or (event2). At state0 both disjuncts are false, so C3 is false at state0; at state1 and later event2 is true so C3 is true there.

- C4 = (If C1 holds then C3 holds). Since C1 never holds (in particular it is false in the initial state), the implication is vacuously true. Thus C4 holds.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from any state with event1, the only possible next state(s) have event1 (so the system stays at event1 forever).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here since event2 is never reached).

Evaluate the hypothesis components:
1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the system stays at event1 forever from the initial state, event2 never happens. So C1 is False.
2. C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since event1 holds (in the initial state and in every state), C2 is True (regardless of C1).
3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Every next state from any state is event1, and event1 implies C2, so C2 holds in the next state. Thus C3 is True in the initial state and indeed at every state.

1. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen — so the system stays at event1 forever.
   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs in any reachable state.

2. Unpack the hypothesis:
   - C1: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. This is the formula (event2 → event2), which is a tautology and thus true in every state.
   - C2: C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true at every state (the next state also satisfies C1).
   - C3: C2 holds in the next state. For the same reason, C3 is true at every state (the next state satisfies C2).

Context implies strict alternation between event2 and event1, starting with event2:
- Initially event2.
- After event2 must come event1.
- After event1 must come event2.
So the state sequence is event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Evaluate the components at the initial state (the usual convention in these problems):

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From initial event2, the next state is event1, so C1 is True at the initial state.
2. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is true in any state where event1 does not hold (vacuously), and false in any state where event1 holds (because after event1 the next state is event2, so C1 would be false). In particular, at the initial state (which is event2) the antecedent is false, so C2 is True there.
3. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" At the initial state event2 is true, so C3 is True at the initial state.
4. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Since event2 is true at the initial state, C4 is True at the initial state.

(As a note: C4 is True in event2 states and False in event1 states, so it is not true in every state, but it is true at the initial state.)

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once in an event1 state, all future states remain event1.
(So the system stays in event1 forever.)

Hypothesis formulas:
- C1: event1 holds in the next state.
- C2: (C1) → (event1 holds now).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.
- C4: C3 eventually holds.

Reasoning:
1. From the context, every state (initial and all future) has event1 true. In particular, the next state after the initial state also has event1 true.
2. Therefore C1 (event1 in the next state) is true at the initial state.
3. C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event1 (now)"". At the initial state C1 is true and event1 (now) is true, so the implication C2 is true at the initial state.
4. Consider the next state. It also has event1 true, so the same reasoning shows C1 is true there and event1 (now) is true there, hence C2 is true in the next state. Thus C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true at the initial state.
5. Since C3 is true already (at the initial state), ""C3 eventually holds"" is true.

1. C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" simplifies to Event1 (C1 ≡ Event1).

   - Initially event1 holds.

System behavior:
- Initially: event2.
- From event2: event1 must happen next.
- From event1: no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 thereafter).

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context the only possible run is: state0 = event1, state1 = event2, then stay at event2 forever (after event1 must go to event2; after event2 no other events can happen).
2. Evaluate C1 = (event2 AND event1). In any single state only one event holds, so C1 is false in every state.
3. Evaluate C2 = (if event1 then C1).
   - At state0: event1 is true but C1 is false, so C2 is false at state0.
   - At state1 and afterwards: event1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C2 holds in all states ≥ state1.
4. Evaluate C3 = (if C2 then event1).
   - At state0: C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C3 holds at state0.
   - At state1 and afterwards: C2 is true but event1 is false, so C3 is false there.
5. C4 = ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 holds already at the initial state (state0), C4 is true (eventually includes the current state).

1. From the context: initially event2 holds (call that state s0). After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state s1 has event1). After event1, no other events can happen — interpreted as it stays at event1 thereafter (s1, s2, ... all have event1).

2. C1 = (event2 AND event1). Since at most one event holds in any single state, no state can have both event2 and event1 true simultaneously. So C1 is false in every state.

5. C4 = (C3 holds in the next state). From the initial state s0 there is a next state s1 (with event1), and since C3 is true in every state, C3 is true at s1. Thus C4 is true at the initial state.

1. From the context, the system alternates: initially event1, and after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen. So the next state after the initial one is event2 (not event1).
2. C1 = (event2 or event1) — this holds in every state (one of the two events always happens).
3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 already holds now (and always), C2 is true in all states.
4. C3 = (if C2 holds then event1 happens). Because C2 is true, C3 is equivalent to asserting event1 holds in the same state.
5. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" — thus C4 requires event1 to hold in the next state.
6. But the next state is event2, so event1 does not hold there. Therefore C3 does not hold in the next state, and C4 is false."

2. C3 is ""C2 always holds"".
3. C2 is ""C1 always holds"".
4. C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".

6. Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen — therefore the system stays in the event1 state forever, so Event1 holds in all states.

Context summary:
- State0: initially event1 happened (event1 true, event2 false).
- From event1, event2 must happen → State1: event2 happens.
- From event2, no other events can happen → from State1 onward, event2 holds forever.

Evaluate hypothesis components:
1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is true in State0 (event2 is false) but false in State1 and thereafter (event2 holds).
2. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" = event1 AND (not event2). That holds in State0 (event1 true, event2 false) but is false in State1 and all later states (event2 true).
3. C3: ""C2 always holds"" (globally). This is false, because C2 fails at State1.
4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e., there is some future state at which C3 holds. For C3 to hold at some state s, C2 would have to hold at s and at all states after s. But event2 occurs at State1 and persists, so C2 fails at State1 and at every later state. There is no state from which C2 holds forever.

Therefore C4 is False.

Reasoning:
1. The system alternates: initial state s0 has event1 true; then s1 has event2 true; then s2 event1; s3 event2; etc.
2. C1 is the same-state implication ""if event1 then event2."" At any state where event1 is true (s0, s2, ...), event2 is false, so C1 is false in those states. Thus C1 does not hold (globally).
3. C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true at s0 (since C1 is false there) but false at s1, because at s1 event1 is false so C1 is true (vacuously), making C2 false at s1.
4. C3 (""C2 always holds"") would require C2 to be true in every state; but C2 is false at every event2 state, so C3 is false in every state.
5. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") asks whether there is some future state from which C3 holds forever. That cannot happen because the system keeps alternating and event2 states (where C2 is false) occur infinitely often, so there is no point after which C2 is always true.

1. Context: states alternate starting with event1: initial state has event1; the next state must be event2; then event1; then event2; and so on. So event1 and event2 alternate and neither holds in every state.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is just event2 (C1 ≡ event2). So C1 holds exactly in states where event2 is true (every other state).

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" means event2 must be true in every state. That is false because the initial state has event1 (not event2). So C2 is false.

   - Event1 is true in State 0 but false in State 1 and later. So C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"".
   - C1 is false in every state, so the conjunction C1 ∧ event2 is false in every state. Hence C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""Event1 always happens"".
   - C3 is identical to C1, so C3 is also false.

- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
- So the system alternates: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, … (infinite alternation).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- At state0 (event1) C1 is true (next state is event2). At state1 (event2) C1 is false (next state is event1). So C1 holds at every event1 state, but not at event2 states.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 = ""Event2 happens AND C1 holds.""
- That requires event2 to be true now and event2 to be true in the next state (since C1 is ""event2 in next state"").
- But in this system, after event2 the next state is event1, so event2 cannot be true in two consecutive states.
- Therefore C2 is false in every state (no state has event2 now and event2 next).

- C3 = ""C2 holds AND event2 happens."" Since C2 is always false, C3 is always false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initial state s0 has event2. After event2 the next state must be event1, and after event1 no other events can happen (so once event1 holds it continues to hold). So the run is: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event1, ...

2. Interpret the formulas as state propositions:
   - C1(state): (event2 -> event1) evaluated in that same state.
   - C2(state): C1 holds in the next state.
   - C3(state): (C2 -> event1) in that same state.
   - C4: C3 holds always (in every state).

3. Evaluate C1:
   - At s0: event2 is true and event1 is false, so C1 is false at s0.
   - At s1 and later: event2 is false, so C1 is true at those states.

4. Evaluate C2 (C1 in the next state):
   - At s0: next state is s1, where C1 is true, so C2 is true at s0.
   - At s1 and later: next states have C1 true, so C2 is true everywhere.

5. Evaluate C3 (C2 -> event1):
   - At s0: C2 is true but event1 is false, so C3 is false at s0.
   - At s1 and later: C2 true and event1 true, so C3 true there.

6. C4 requires C3 to hold in every state, but C3 is false at s0. Therefore C4 is false."

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (event1 → event1) and therefore holds in every state.

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 reduces to just ""event2 happens"" (True → event2 ≡ event2). So C2 holds exactly in states where event2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" is ¬event2. At the initial state C1 is true.
3. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means ¬event2 in the next state. But after event1 the next state must be event2, so in the next state event2 is true and ¬event2 is false. Thus C2 is false at the initial state.
4. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" is the implication C2 → event2. Since C2 is false, the implication is true at the initial state.

3. In the initial state event2 is true and event1 is false (context: ""Initially, event2 happened"").

1. Context: S0 (initial) has event1. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the timeline is forced to alternate: S0 = event1, S1 = event2, S2 = event1, S3 = event2, ...

2. Write the claims:
   - C1: event1 OR event2.
   - C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state either event1 or event2).
   - C3: event1 AND C2 (i.e., current state has event1, and in the next state C1 holds).
   - C4: C3 holds in the next state (i.e., in the next state: event1 AND (in its next state C1 holds)).

3. Evaluate at S0: event1 is true. The next state S1 is event2 (by the after-event1 rule). In S1, event2 is true, so C1 holds in S1 (since C1 = event1 or event2). Thus C2 holds in S0 (because C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" and S1 satisfies C1). Therefore C3 holds in S0 (event1 at S0 and C2 at S0).

4. C4 requires that C3 hold in S1. That means S1 must have event1 and also its next state S2 must satisfy C1. But S1 is event2 (not event1), so the conjunct ""event1 in S1"" is false.

5. Because S1 does not have event1, C3 is false in S1, so C4 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system alternates: initial state s0 has event1; then s1 has event2; then s2 has event1; etc., forever alternating event1 ↔ event2.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""  
   - At s0 this is true (next state s1 is event2). At s1 it is false (next state s2 is event1), and so on alternately.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C1).  
   - At s0 C2 is false (because C1 true at s0). At s1 C2 is true, but it alternates.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., from the current state onward, C2 holds at every future state).  
   - At s0 C2 is already false, so C3 is false at s0. In fact no state satisfies C3 because in any future from any state there is a position where the next state is event2 and thus C2 fails there.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds"" (i.e., C3 holds at every state).  
   - Since C3 is false (already false at s0), C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Context: initial state = event1. From event1 the next state must be event2, and from event2 the next state must be event1 (they alternate).

1. C1 = ""event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state (event1), the next state must be event2, so C1 is false.
2. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also false.
3. C3 = ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" At the initial state event1 does happen, so C3 is true (even though C2 is false).

1. Context: Initially event1 happened. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once in the event1 state the system stays at event1 (no transition to event2 or anything else). (Similarly, ""after event2, no other events can happen"" would make event2 persistent if it ever occurred.)
2. From the initial state we are in event1 and will remain in event1 forever. Therefore event2 never happens on the actual trace.

4. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial state, C2 is true (it holds immediately, hence eventually).

1. Interpret C1 as a state property: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" = (not event1) or event2.
2. The initial state has event1 true and event2 false (only event1 happened). So C1 is false in the initial state.
3. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (globally). Since C1 is already false in the initial state, C2 is false.
4. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state."" From the initial state, no other events can happen after event1, so the next state is identical (event1 true, event2 false). C1 remains false there, so C2 is false in that next state; hence C3 is false.

Evaluate C1, C2, C3, C4:
- At s0: event1 is false, so (event1 -> event2) is true. Thus C1 holds at s0. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false at s0.

2. Simplify C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is just Event2. So C1 ⇔ event2.

3. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", so C2 ⇔ ¬event2. Given only event1 or event2 occur, C2 ⇔ event1.

4. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" ⇒ C3 at a state means the next state has event1.

5. C4 is ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" ⇒ current state has event1 and the next state also has event1 (i.e., two consecutive event1 states).

6. But the rules require that after any event1 the next state is event2, so two consecutive event1 states are impossible. Therefore C4 is never true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Timeline from the context: State0 (initial) = event1. From event1 the next state must be event2. From event2 it stays at event2 forever (no other events can happen).
2. C1 = ""event1 does not happen"" (¬event1). So:
   - At State0: C1 is false (event1 happens).
   - At State1 and all later states: C1 is true (those states are event2).
3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at state s, C2(s) = C1(s+1)).
   - At State0: C2 is true because C1 holds at State1.
   - At State1 and all later states: C2 is true because their next state is event2 and thus C1 holds there.
   So C2 holds at every state.
4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (globally). Since C2 is true at every state, C3 is true.
5. C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" = ¬C3. Because C3 is true, C4 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" (event1 ∧ C2).

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is the state formula (event2 -> event1). Evaluate:
   - At state0: event2 is false, so C1 is true.
   - At state1 (and thereafter): event2 is true and event1 is false, so C1 is false there.
3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true at the initial state (state0), there exists a (trivial) future state where C1 holds, so C2 is true.
4. C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" At the initial state C2 holds (true), and event1 also happens there; thus C3 is true.
5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Because C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the context as a state sequence. Initially event1 is true (state S0). After event1, event2 must occur, so the next state S1 has event2 true. After event2 no other events can happen, so all subsequent states remain event2 (S1, S2, ... have event2 true).

2. C1 and C2 are identical: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Treat these as state formulas evaluated at the initial state (as in the examples).

3. At the initial state S0: event1 is true and event2 is false. The implication (event2 → event1) is true when the antecedent is false. Thus C1 (and C2) hold at the initial state.

4. Therefore C3 = (C1 or C2) holds. C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" is false.

So C4 is False."

1. C1 = (event1 AND event2) — requires event1 and event2 simultaneously in one state. Given only one event per state and event2 never occurs, C1 is always false.
2. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is false in every state.
3. C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" — C2 is false, so C3 is true.
4. C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is true, C4 is false.

1. Initially event2 is true.
2. After event2, no other events can happen — so once in the event2 state, event1 can never occur later.
3. C1 (event2 and event1) requires both event2 and event1 to be true simultaneously in a state. That cannot happen (event1 never occurs), so C1 is false.
4. C2 is ""event2 or C1"". Since event2 is true initially, C2 is true.
5. C3 is the same as C1 (event2 and event1), so C3 is false.
6. C4 is ""C2 and C3"". Since C3 is false, C4 is false regardless of C2.

1. Initial state: event2 is true.
2. After event2, no other events can happen → the system remains at event2 (event1 never occurs in any future state).
3. C1 = (event1 or event2). Since event2 holds, C1 is true (now and always).
4. C2 = (event1 or C1) = event1 or (event1 or event2) = (event1 or event2). So C2 is true (now and always).
5. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state is event2, where C2 is true, so C3 is true in the initial state.
6. C4 = (C3 holds) and (event1 happens). Although C3 is true, event1 is false in the initial state (and never occurs), so C4 is false.

1. Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So every state has event1 true (the system stays at event1). Event2 never occurs in any state.

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false in the initial state (and in every state), because event1 holds everywhere.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false now (and always), C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is false but event1 does happen (initially and thereafter), so C3 is true (indeed true in every state).

5. C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C3 is true, but event2 never happens, so the implication is false.

1. Initially event2 is true.
2. After event2, no other events can happen — so all future states remain event2 (event1 never occurs).
3. C1 is ""event2 does not happen"" — this is false in the initial and all future states.
4. C2 is ""event1 happens and C1 holds"" — impossible, since event1 never happens and C1 is always false; so C2 is always false.
5. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" — false because C2 never holds.
6. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" — false because C3 never holds.
