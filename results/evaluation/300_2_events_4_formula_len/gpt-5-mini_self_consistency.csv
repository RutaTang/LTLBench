Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" That is: C1 → C2.
- C4: ""C3 always holds.""

Step 3 — logical reasoning
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition (call it P). C3 is the implication P → P.
- Any implication of the form P → P is a tautology (always true), independent of whether P itself is true or false.
- Therefore C3 always holds in every model/trace.

Step 4 — context check (optional)
- The event rules (initially event2; after event2 → event1; after event1 → event2) imply event2 occurs repeatedly, so P is actually true in this system — but that’s unnecessary for the conclusion because C3 is already tautologically true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- You ask whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is the implication C1 → C2.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" I.e., the implication C1 → C2 holds at all times (or in all models).

Step 3 — analyze
- C1 and C2 are identical statements. The implication ""if P then P"" (P → P) is a logical tautology; it is true in every situation regardless of the truth of P.
- Therefore C3 is true in all circumstances.
- Since C3 is always true, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1 and C2 are identical: ""Event2 always happens"" (call this proposition P).
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"", i.e. P → P.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds"" (i.e. the proposition P → P holds at all times).

Step 3 — reason about C3 and C4
- For any proposition P, P → P is a tautology (it is always true).
- Therefore C3 is true at every point.
- Since C3 holds at all times, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially (in the current/initial state) event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so in the next state (and all future states) no events (in particular event2) can occur.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (it cannot occur after event1).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False, because no events can happen after event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 did happen initially, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" Event1 is true (and C3 is also true), so C4 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 is ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — given facts
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true at the initial point of evaluation.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur in any future state after that initial event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (given the second fact).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since no events can happen after event1, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C1 is false and event2 does not happen), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 does happen (initially), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" Event1 happens, and C3 is true, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true at the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no events (including event2) can occur in any subsequent state.
- After event2, event1 must happen (this is a constraint but irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 = False.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C1 is false, event2 does not happen), so C2 = False.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 is true (it happened initially), so C3 = True.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" Event1 is true (and C3 is true), so C4 = True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen (so the run terminates right after event1). After event2 no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
- C1: event1 → event2.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e. the implication holds in all states).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.
- C4: event1 happens OR C3 holds.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- In the initial state event1 did happen (given).
- Because no events can happen after event1, event2 does not happen after event1. Therefore C1 (event1 → event2) is false in this run, and C2 is false.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is irrelevant to C4 because the initial state already satisfies the left disjunct; also there is no next state after the initial state, so C3 would not hold under the usual “no next state means next-formula false” interpretation.
- C4 is a disjunction: since ""event1 happens"" is true in the initial state, C4 is true regardless of C3.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step by step):
1. The question asks whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.
2. Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen (so no event2 can occur after the initial state).
3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the actual run, event1 did happen but event2 cannot occur afterward, so C1 is false in the initial state (antecedent true, consequent false).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already false, C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state with events (and C2 is false), so C3 is false.
4. C4 is a disjunction: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" The left disjunct (""Event1 happens"") is true (it happened initially), so C4 is true regardless of C3.

Thus C4 is True.

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened (time 0: event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so time 1: event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so time 2: event2).
Thus the system alternates: event2 (t0), event1 (t1), event2 (t2), event1 (t3), ...

Step 2 — evaluate each condition at the initial state:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At time 0 the next state (time 1) has event1, not event2 → C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1 → C2 is false at time 0.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" There is a future state (time 1) at which C2 is true (because at time 1 the next state, time 2, has event2). So C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true; here the antecedent C1 is false, and in fact the consequent C3 is also true. Therefore the implication is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen.
- These two rules force an infinite alternation of events starting from the initial event2: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the initial event2 and Rule B, event1 will occur next — so C1 is true.
- C2: same statement as C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") — so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is the property ""event1 eventually happens"". Because of the enforced alternation, that property holds at the initial time and continues to hold at every future time (event1 keeps occurring repeatedly). Thus there will be a (indeed many) future point(s) where C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- Therefore both C1 and C3 are true.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C4 = C1 or C3. Since at least one (in fact both) of C1 and C3 is true, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C4 is ""C1 holds or C3 holds"".
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = ""eventually (Event1 eventually happens).""

Step 2 — use the context rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 will occur (so C1 is true).
- Also, the rules force alternation (after event1 → event2 → event1 → ...), so event1 indeed eventually happens from the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- Since C1 is true, C4 = (C1 or C3) is true regardless of C3.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So starting from an initial event2, the system forces event1 to occur sometime later (and then event2 again, etc.).
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""  
- C2: identical to C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point (possibly now) the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" will be true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds.""

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because event2 happened initially and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" applies, event1 will occur at some future time. Thus C1 is true (and so is C2).
- Since C2 is true now, the statement ""eventually C2"" (C3) is also true (if a property holds now, it certainly holds at some future/now point).
- Therefore both C1 and C3 are true, so their disjunction C4 is true.

Sample responses:
First: the hypothesis asks whether C4 is true or false.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just event1 (A ∨ A = A).
- C2: same, also event1.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" is event1 ∧ event1, i.e. event1.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" is event1 → event1, which is a tautology (always true).

Use the context: event1 initially happened (so event1 is true), and the temporal rules (""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"") do not contradict event1's truth; they in fact allow event1 to recur but are unnecessary for the truth of C4.

Since C4 is the implication event1 → event1 (a tautology) and the antecedent is true in the given context, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1, so equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds, so C3 is ""Event1 happens"" AND ""Event1 happens"", i.e. simply ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: If C3 holds, then event1 happens. Substituting, C4 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" — a tautological implication.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true, so C1 and C2 are true and hence C3 is true. The implication in C4 has a true antecedent and a true consequent, so it is true.

Conclusion
- C4 is True

True
---
Identify what’s asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Examine each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ensure event1 does occur (at least initially) and, if anything happens later, event1 and event2 alternate.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (P ∨ P ≡ P).
- C2: same as C1, so also equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds → that is ""Event1 happens"" ∧ ""Event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" is therefore ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"", i.e. P → P.

Trace and conclude
- From the context, event1 does happen (initially), so C1, C2, and C3 are true.
- The implication P → P is always true; and here, since C3 is true and the consequent is true, C4 is true.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is equivalent to C1 (or C2): ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- So C4 is asking whether ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens"" holds at all times.

Step 3 — use the context rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 will occur later).
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- Starting from the initial event1, these obligations force an alternating sequence of events (event1 → event2 → event1 → ...). Thus from any point in time there is guaranteed to be a next occurrence of either event1 or event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Interpreting ""happens"" in the usual temporal sense (""will occur at some point in the future from the current time""), the disjunction ""event1 or event2 happens"" is always true because the mutual obligations force repeated occurrences.
- (Note: if one instead interpreted ""happens"" as ""is occurring at this exact instant"" with instantaneous events, there are instants between events when neither is occurring; under that reading C4 would fail. But the natural reading with the given rules is the temporal/eventual one.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 asserts ""C3 always holds.""
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds.""
- C1 and C2 are both ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
So C1 = C2, and C3 is equivalent to C1 (or C2). Thus C4 is asking whether ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" holds always.

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially event1 happened (so C1 is true initially).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 → event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: event1 occurs.
- By event1 → event2, event2 will occur next.
- By event2 → event1, event1 will occur after that.
- This enforces an alternating sequence of event1, event2, event1, event2, … indefinitely.

Step 4 — conclude about C4:
- At every point in this execution the system ensures that either event1 or event2 occurs (indeed they keep alternating), so ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" is always true.
Therefore C4 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C4 asserts that C3 always holds.
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"".
- C1 and C2 are both ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens"" (they are the same).

So C4 says: at every moment, (Event1 happens or Event2 happens).

Step 2 — understand the context / constraints
- Initially Event1 happened (so at the initial moment Event1 is true).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (i.e. whenever Event1 occurs, at some later time Event2 will occur).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen (i.e. whenever Event2 occurs, at some later time Event1 will occur).

Events are taken as instantaneous occurrences and the obligations only require a future occurrence, not that events hold continuously.

Step 3 — trace a possible timeline
A simple timeline consistent with the rules:
- t0: Event1 occurs (given).
- t1: nothing occurs (an intermediate moment).
- t2: Event2 occurs (required after t0).
- t3: nothing occurs.
- t4: Event1 occurs (required after t2).
- t5: nothing occurs, etc.

Step 4 — check C3 at all times
- At t0, Event1 holds, so C3 is true.
- At t1 (between events) neither Event1 nor Event2 is occurring, so C1 and C2 are false and thus C3 is false.
- Because there exist moments (t1, t3, t5, ...) where neither event holds, C3 does not hold at all times.

Conclusion
C4 (""C3 always holds"") is False."

Step 1 — what's asked:
- Determine whether C4 (""C3 holds or event2 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (implication A → A), so C1 is True.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are True, C3 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" A disjunction is True if at least one disjunct is True; C3 is True, so C4 is True (independent of whether event2 happened).

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — What’s being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; C3 is already true (and event2 also occurred initially), so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 is true in all situations.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. C3 is already true, so C4 is true regardless of whether event2 happened.

Step 3 — Context check
The context (event2 happened initially and the mutual requirements) also implies event2 does happen, but that is unnecessary because C3 already guarantees C4.

True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initially event2 happened (so the initial state is a state where event2 has occurred).
2. The context says ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — the state with event2 is terminal; there is no next state in which new events occur.
3. C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state."" That requires a next state to exist where C2 (i.e., C1 holds and event2 happens) is true.
4. Because there is no next state after the state where event2 occurred, C3 cannot hold.
5. C4 is ""C3 does not hold,"" so C4 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially, event2 happened (given).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means there is no future state in which event2 (or any other event) can occur again.
- C1 says ""if event2 happens then event1 happens."" The context does not state event1 happened initially, so C1 does not hold in the initial state (and in any case cannot be made to hold later because no events can occur after event2).
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false (it does not hold), C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state where event2 (and thus C2) can hold, because after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and likewise after event1 no other events can happen). So once event2 has occurred the system cannot produce any further events (there is effectively no later state with new events).

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" In the actual initial state event2 did happen, but there is no indication that event1 happened (and no further events can occur afterward). Therefore the implication event2 → event1 is false in this situation (because event2 is true but event1 is false).

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event2 is true).

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state with new events after event2, and in any case C2 is already false, so C3 is false.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3; since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Hence C4 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a tautology written redundantly).
- C2: the same as C1, so C2 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" means ""Event1 happens at all times"" (i.e., globally/always).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" ≡ ""Event1 happens (somewhere) or Event1 happens always"".

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate
- Context says: initially event1 happened. So C1 (event1 happens) is true (it occurs initially).
- Context also says after event1, event2 must happen and after event2 no other events can happen. That implies event1 does not hold at all times (it happens initially but not necessarily at every later time), so C3 (""event1 always"") is false.

Step 4 — conclude
- C4 = C1 ∨ C3 = true ∨ false = True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify what’s being asked
- C4 is ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — redundant disjunction, so C1 ≡ “Event1 happens.”
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ “Event1 happens.”
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" ≡ “Event1 always holds” (i.e., event1 holds at all times).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" ≡ “Event1 happens (somewhere) or Event1 always holds.”

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate
- Context says: initially event1 happened. So C1 (and C2) is true (event1 does happen).
- Context also says after event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. That means event1 does not hold at all later times, so C3 (“event1 always holds”) is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C4 is C1 OR C3. Since C1 is true, C4 is true regardless of C3.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify what's asked
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true at the initial moment.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 will occur sometime after the initial event1.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So there are later states where no events occur.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"". This is true at the initial moment because event1 happened initially.
- C2: same as C1, so true at the initial moment.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this asserts that ""event1 happens"" holds at all times. That is false, because after event2 occurs there are states where event1 is not happening (event1 only occurred initially), so C2 does not hold at all times; therefore C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 = C1 or C3. C1 is true (at the initial moment), C3 is false, so C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You’re asking whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the definitions C1–C3.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (p → p). It holds in every state (true whether event1 occurs or not).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true (C1 holds globally).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Same reasoning: C2 is globally true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Given C3 is true now and at every future time, C3 certainly holds at some time (in fact at all times), so ""eventually C3"" is true.

Step 3 — trace events (consistency check)
The context gives a timeline: event1 initially occurs, then event2 must occur, and after event2 nothing else can occur. That concrete timeline does not contradict any of C1–C3; C1 is tautologically true at every moment, so the temporal constraints don’t affect it.

Conclusion
C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It holds in every state regardless of the event history.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, the temporal statement ""always C1"" is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This is just another nesting of ""always""; since C2 is true at every state, C3 is also true at every state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" ""Eventually"" means there exists some time point where C3 holds. If C3 holds at all times, it certainly holds at some time, so C4 is satisfied.

Step 3 — note about the context
- The given event constraints (initial event1, event2 must follow event1, nothing after event2) do not affect the logical tautology p → p, so they do not change the above conclusions.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 says: ""C3 eventually holds."" We must determine whether that is true given the context and the chain C1→C2→C3→C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P). It is true in every state (true whether or not event1 holds).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, ""always C1"" is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Nesting another always over a property that already always holds is still true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 holds now (indeed it holds in all states), then it certainly holds at some future (including the present) point — so ""eventually C3"" is true.

Step 3 — role of the context
The facts about event1 and event2 do not make C1 false; C1 is a tautology independent of the event constraints. Thus the context does not prevent C4 from being true.

- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and map to the context
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, ""After event2, event1 must happen."" and ""After event1, event2 must happen.""
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the same as ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — so C1 holds.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 also holds.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 hold, C3 holds immediately.

Step 3 — does C3 eventually hold?
- C3 already holds (true from the start), so it certainly holds at some time in the future as well. Therefore ""C3 eventually holds"" is true.

Goal: determine whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

- C1 and C2 are both the same statement: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""  
- The context explicitly gives ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" so C1 and C2 are satisfied.  
- C3 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and C2 holds,"" so C3 holds immediately.  
- If C3 holds now, then it certainly holds at some (immediate) time — so ""C3 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what is asked:
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- Context gives: initially event2 happened. Also the rules:
  - After event1, event2 must happen. (i.e., event1 → eventually event2)
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (i.e., event2 → eventually event1)
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the context rule ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 holds.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This is identical to C1, so C2 also holds.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. Since both C1 and C2 hold, C3 holds (immediately).
- C4: C3 eventually holds. Because C3 already holds now, it holds at some time (now), so it certainly ""eventually"" holds.

- Since C1 and C2 are identical, C1 holding implies C2 holds.
- If C2 holds, then (C2 ∨ event2) holds, so C3 holds.
- Thus C1 → C3 is true. (Logically, for any propositions P,Q, P → (P ∨ Q) is a tautology.)

- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens.
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds.

Step 3 — logical reasoning:
- Because C1 and C2 are the same statement, whenever C1 holds, C2 also holds.
- If C2 holds, then the disjunction ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" (i.e., C3) is true.
- Therefore, whenever C1 holds, C3 holds. That exactly makes C4 true.

- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Same as C1.) So C2 is true.
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens. Since C2 is true, C3 is true (an OR is true if one disjunct is true). Also event2 does in fact happen, so C3 is true by either disjunct.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 states: If C1 holds, then C3 holds.
- C1 holds (true) and C3 holds (true), so the implication ""If C1 then C3"" is true.

Sample responses:
We are being asked whether C4 is True or False.

1) Identify the hypothesis: C4 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds.""

2) Examine the conditions:
- C1: event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: event2 happens in the next state. (C1 and C2 are the same proposition.)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is the tautology ""P → P"", which is always true.
- C4: event1 → C3. Because C3 is always true, the implication event1 → C3 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent).

3) Context about event ordering does not affect these logical relations: C3 is true independently, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.
- C1 and C2 both state: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (they are the same proposition).
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — i.e. A -> A for A = ""Event2 happens in the next state.""

Step 3 — reason about C3
- A -> A is always true (either because A is true and implies itself, or because if A is false the implication is vacuously true). So C3 is true in all cases.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 asserts: event1 -> C3. Since C3 is true unconditionally, the implication event1 -> C3 is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens. Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C4 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds.""

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is the tautology C1 -> C1, which is always true (holds in every state).
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" This is an implication whose consequent C3 is always true.

Step 3 — conclude
- Because C3 is always true, the implication ""event1 -> C3"" is true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs. Therefore C4 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C4 says: ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C4 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a trivial/tautological implication; it is true whenever evaluated.
- C2: same as C1, also trivially true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether C3 will hold at some time in the run.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence using the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 will occur at some point.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- Independent of the events, C1 and C2 are tautologies, so C3 is already true (and remains true).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because C3 is true (already), it certainly ""eventually holds."" Therefore C4 is True.

Final answer: True
---
1) What the hypothesis asks
- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" So we must determine whether at some point in the timeline C3 (which is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"") becomes true.

2) Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p); it is true whenever evaluated.
- C2: identical to C1, also a tautology and thus true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, their conjunction C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This requires only that there exists a point in the timeline where C3 is true.

3) Trace the event sequence (context)
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, event2 must happen — so event2 does happen.
- After event2 no other events can happen — the timeline ends after event2.
- The occurrence (or non-occurrence) of events does not change that C1 and C2 are tautologically true; in particular, because event2 does happen they are certainly true at least at that point as well.

4) Conclusion
- C3 is true (indeed true immediately), so C3 holds at some time (now), hence C3 eventually holds.
- Therefore C4 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A). It is true (vacuously or non-vacuously) at any time.
- C2: same as C1, so also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true (in fact it holds at all times).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 already holds (and thus holds at some time, including immediately), C3 does indeed hold at some time in the (present or future) timeline — so ""eventually"" is satisfied.

Step 3 — event trace (consistency check)
- From the context: event1 occurs, then event2 must occur, and nothing can happen after event2. That guarantees event2 happens, but C1/C2 do not depend on any extra conditions — they are tautologies — so C3 holds regardless of the event trace.

- C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, the sequence is terminal (no future events).
- After event1, event2 must happen — but this is irrelevant if event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any point. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""
- C1 is false, even though event2 does happen initially. The conjunction is false. So C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3: ""C2 always holds.""
- C2 is false, so C3 (that C2 always holds) is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C4: ""C3 does not hold.""
- C3 is false, so ""C3 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 has already happened.
- Rule 1: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- Rule 2: After event2 happens, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — consequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no events (including event1) can ever occur after the initial state.
- Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false — in fact event1 does not occur at all.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is false because C1 is false (event2 did happen initially, but C1 fails).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is already false.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"". Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's asked:
C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, event2 must happen — but that only matters if event1 can occur.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given that event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event2 does happen initially).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's being asked:
C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the setup.

Step 2 — examine each condition:

- C2: identical to C1, so also always true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true, and C2 is true, the implication C1 → C2 is true. More generally, because C1 and C2 are logically valid, C3 is true in every possible situation.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is true in every situation (it follows from tautological nature of C1 and C2), C3 indeed always holds.

Step 3 — event constraints:
The facts about events (event1 happened initially and prevents further events, event2 would also prevent further events) do not conflict with the logical tautologies above; they do not make any of C1–C3 false.

Conclusion:
True

Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — examine each condition

- C2: same as C1, so also true in every state.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both true (indeed identical), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is true in every state (its antecedent and consequent are tautologically true), C3 does always hold.

The contextual facts about events do not affect these tautological implications.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 asserts “C3 always holds.” We must decide if, given the context, C3 holds in every reachable state (so C4 is true) or not.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
C1: If event1 happens, then event1 happens.  
C2: If event1 happens, then event1 happens.  
C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds.  
C4: C3 always holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
The formula “If event1 happens, then event1 happens” is a logical tautology (p → p). A tautology is true in every state, so both C1 and C2 hold in all states of the system.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
C3 says “if C1 holds then C2 holds.” Since C1 holds (indeed everywhere), and C2 also holds everywhere, the implication C3 is true in every state.

Step 5 — evaluate C4
C4 requires that C3 hold in all states. Since C3 is true in every state (as shown), C4 is true.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 is true.

Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 is the claim ""C3 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After every event1, event2 must happen. After every event2, event1 must happen. So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial event1, event2 will occur next, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" At every point in time (after any event), because the alternation continues forever, there will always be a future occurrence of event2. Thus C1 holds at every time, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is true (a global truth), C3 is true at every time.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is true at every time (C2 is globally true), C3 does indeed always hold.

Conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
The question: given the alternating requirement (initially event1; after event1 → event2; after event2 → event1), is C4 true?

Step-by-step:

- From the context we get an infinite alternation: e1 at start, then e2, then e1, then e2, … So event2 occurs (in fact infinitely often).
- C1 (Event2 eventually happens) — True (e2 must occur after the initial e1).
- C2 (C1 always holds, i.e. from every point eventually e2) — True, because e2 occurs infinitely often, so from any point there is a future e2.
- C3 (Event2 happens or C2 holds) — True (since C2 holds, the disjunction is true at every point; also C1 holds initially).
- C4 (C3 always holds) — True, because C2 holds at every point so C3 holds at every point.

Final answer: True
---
Goal: determine whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So the system forces an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step-by-step:
1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True at the initial point because event1 has just happened and the rule says after event1 event2 must happen. So C1 holds.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every future point, event2 will eventually happen). From any point in the alternating sequence:
   - If the last event was event1, event2 happens next.
   - If the last event was event2, then event1 happens next and then event2 after that.
   Thus from every state there is a future occurrence of event2. So C2 (G(F(event2))) is true.

3. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is true, the disjunction is true at every point (it doesn't matter whether event2 is happening right now). So C3 holds.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C2 is true at all times, C3 is true at all times, so C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the question: is C4 (Event2 happens or C3 holds) true or false given the context?

Context and timeline
- Initially (in the current/initial state) event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in the next state no events occur).
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 does not occur here.

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is false because after event2 no events (including event2) can occur in the next state.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" In the current state event2 did happen, but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" In the current state event2 did happen (true), and C3 is also true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine the truth of C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (So there is no subsequent state where events occur.) Also: if event1 occurs, event2 must follow.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, there is no next state after the initial event2 (no further events can happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 does not hold.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" We already have that event2 happened (initially) and we also have C3 true. Either way, the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur in any subsequent state).
- If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards (but there is no information that event1 actually occurs).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" After the initial event2, no events can happen in later states, so event2 does not occur in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Therefore C2 does not hold.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" From above, C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), and C3 also holds; thus the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context facts:
- event1 happened initially.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
From this we know event1 is true (it happened) and event2 cannot occur after event1, so event2 does not happen.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This is false because event2 does not happen (event1 does).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 is true, so the implication C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is false, so the implication is vacuously true. (Even if you check counterfactually, C3 is true anyway.)

Conclusion: C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no other event (including event2) can occur after event1.
- Therefore, event2 does not happen in the actual situation (event2 is false).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 = (event2 and event1). Since event2 is false, C1 is false.
- C2 = not C1. So C2 is true.
- C3 = (if C2 then event1). C2 is true and event1 is true, so C3 is true (true → true).
- C4 = (if event2 then C3). In the actual situation event2 is false, so the implication ""if event2 then C3"" is vacuously true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.  
- After event1, no other events can happen.  
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens. Given the context, event1 did happen initially. But since no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur after event1, and there is no earlier time for event2 (event1 is initial). Therefore C1 cannot hold — C1 is false.
- C2: C1 does not hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: If C2 holds, then event1 happens. C2 does hold and event1 indeed happens, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C4
- C4 is: If event2 happens, then C3 holds. To falsify this conditional we would need a model consistent with the context where event2 happens but C3 fails.
- However, under the context event2 cannot occur (event1 already happened initially and prevents any other events). So there are no context-consistent situations where event2 happens. A material conditional with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true.
- Therefore C4 is true given the context.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P). It is true in any state: when event1 happens it is true, and when it doesn't happen the implication is vacuously true.
- C2: identical to C1, so likewise always true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are always true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is true in every state (both C1 and C2 are tautologies), C3 indeed holds at all times.

The given temporal rules about event1 and event2 (initial event1, and each forces the other later) do not contradict or affect the tautological statements C1 and C2.

Final answer:
True
---
First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the conditions C1–C3.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It holds in every state/time.
- C2: Identical to C1; also a tautology and holds always.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are always true, their conjunction is always true.

Therefore:
- C3 always holds, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the definitions C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology P → P, which is true in every state/point of the trace.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology and true everywhere.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true everywhere, C3 is true everywhere.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is true at every point, C4 is true.

Step 3 — relation to the context
- The context (initial event1 and mutual eventualities between event1 and event2) is consistent with the tautological conditions and does not invalidate them.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — clarify the conditions (plain reading)
- Context:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event2, no other events can happen (so the run is stuck after that event).
  3. After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after event2, and there is no indication event1 occurred before the initial event2).
- Hypotheses:
  C1: Event2 always happens.
  C2: C1 eventually holds.
  C3: Event2 always happens. (same as C1)
  C4: C2 holds or C3 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- Because event2 happened initially and no other events can happen thereafter, every actual execution/run contains event2 (in fact the only run available has event2 at the start and then no further events).
- Therefore the statement “Event2 always happens” (C1/C3), read as “event2 occurs in the execution(s)” or “holds in all possible runs,” is true.
- If C1 is already true from the start, then “C1 eventually holds” (C2) is also true (it holds immediately, hence eventually).
- So C2 is true and C3 is true.

Step 4 — conclude C4
- C4 is “C2 or C3”. Since both C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 or C3) is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the scenario
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred the execution stops; no event1 can occur after).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur (event2 already happened initially and no further events can occur).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the initial event2 and the fact nothing else can happen afterward, every possible execution contains event2. Thus C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds from the start, C1 certainly holds at some (indeed every) point, so C2 holds.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 holds.
- C4: C2 or C3 — since both C2 and C3 hold, the disjunction holds.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 has already happened. Also, once event1 happens no further events occur (and similarly for event2). So in every allowed run event1 has occurred at the initial moment.

2. C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true, because event1 already occurred.

3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false: there is no successor state after the state where event1 happened (no further events can occur), so ""next"" does not hold.

4. C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore true.

5. C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens""): the antecedent C3 is true and the consequent ""event1 happens"" is also true (event1 already happened). An implication with a true antecedent and true consequent is true.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the goal
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred in the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, there are no further occurrences of any events afterward.

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true (it happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C2 says that in the next state, event1 will eventually happen (from that next state onward). But since after event1 no other events can happen, from the next state event1 will not occur again. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" The antecedent C3 does hold (we just saw C3 is true). The consequent ""event1 happens"" is also true because event1 already happened initially. So the implication C3 → (event1 happens) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 has happened. Also, if event1 happens (or event2 happens) then no further events occur after that — so the run terminates at the state where event1 happened.

2. C1 (""Event1 eventually happens""): True in the initial state because event1 has already happened.

3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): In the next state (after the initial one) there are no further events and event1 does not occur there. ""Eventually event1"" from that next state is false (event1 will not occur at or after that next state). So C2 is false.

4. C3 (""C2 does not hold""): Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

5. C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens""): The antecedent C3 is true, and the consequent ""event1 happens"" is true (event1 already happened initially). Thus the implication C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what's being asked
- We must decide whether the statement C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — set up states and the context
- Let s0 be the initial state. At s0, event2 happened (given).
- After event2, event1 must happen, so event1 occurs at the next state s1.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so s1 has no successor (no s2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Evaluated at s0, this is true (event1 happens at s1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This says that in s1, C1 is true (i.e., in s1 it is true that event1 happens in the next state). But s1 has no next state, so in s1 the claim ""event1 happens in the next state"" is false. Therefore C2 is false (at s0).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C3 does hold (true). The consequent ""event2 happens"" is true because event2 did happen in the initial state s0. Thus the implication is true.

Final answer:
True
---

---
Step 1 — set up states
- Let s0 be the initial state (event2 happened there).
- After s0, event1 must happen in s1.
- After s1 (where event1 happens), no other events occur in s2 and onward.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at s0
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 this is true (event1 happens in s1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether C1 is true at s1, i.e. whether event1 happens in s2. That is false (after event1 no further events happen).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false at s0, C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" At s0 C3 holds, and event2 did happen (initially at s0). So the implication is satisfied.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C4 says “C3 eventually holds.” We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
(Also “after event1, no other events can happen,” but since event1 never happens here that clause is irrelevant.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C3
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Because event2 already happened and no events can happen after event2, event1 indeed does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: “Event1 does not happen.” Same statement as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” With C1 true and C2 true, the implication is true (and in fact it is a tautological implication here because antecedent and consequent are the same).

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C3 is true now. Since C3 holds at the current (initial) point and nothing later will change that (no further events occur), C3 will hold at some point (indeed immediately and at all times). Therefore “C3 eventually holds” is true.

Answer: True

Identify question
- C4 asks whether ""C3 eventually holds.""

Examine conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus event1 never happens.
- So C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" is true. C2 is the same statement, so C2 is also true.

Evaluate C3
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C3 is true (it already holds).

""Eventually holds""
- C3 holds immediately (hence at some future time it holds), so C3 eventually holds.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — understand each condition:

- C1: Event1 does not happen. Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: Event1 does not happen. Same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same and both true, C3 is true (an implication with true antecedent and true consequent is true; it would also be true vacuously if C1 were false).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some time in the future (i.e., eventually).

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is true.

1) C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" — that is a tautology (A -> A), so C1 is true.
2) C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is true.
3) C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C1 -> C2 is true, so C3 is true.
4) C4 is ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" C3 is already true unconditionally, so the implication (event2 -> C3) is true regardless of whether event2 occurs.

Therefore C4 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: If event1 happens, then event1 happens. This is P -> P, a tautology, so C1 is true in every model.
- C2: Same as C1, also a tautology, so C2 is true.
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Since C1 is true, the implication C1 -> C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: If event2 happens, then C3 holds. C3 is already true (independent of whether event2 happens), so the implication event2 -> C3 is true.

Step 3 — trace events (consistency check)
- From the context: event2 happened initially, and the rules make event1 and event2 alternate, so both events occur — but this temporal fact is unnecessary because C1–C3 are tautologically true anyway.

Conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- Determine whether C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the statements.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, therefore also a tautology and true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C1 → C2 is true (true → true is true). So C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" But C3 is already true regardless of whether event2 happens. An implication with a true consequent is true for any antecedent. Therefore C4 is true.

- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 = True.
- After event2 no other events can happen (so event1 cannot occur afterwards).
- “After event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant because event1 does not occur.

Interpret the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just event2 (tautological repetition). So C1 ⇔ event2.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 ⇔ ¬C1 ⇔ ¬event2.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" So C3 ⇔ (event2 → C2) ⇔ (event2 → ¬event2).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" So C4 ⇔ ¬C3.

Evaluate with event2 = True:
- C1 is True (since event2 is True).
- C2 is False (negation of C1).
- C3 is False because it asserts True → False, which is False.
- C4 is True because C3 is False.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 states ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions using the context
- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 is true.
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" The antecedent (event2) is true, but C2 is false; therefore the implication is false. So C3 does not hold (C3 is false).

Step 3 — conclusion about C4
C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold."" We found C3 is false, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine whether C4 is True or False given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ Event2 happens (tautologically the same).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ not(Event2 happens).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" ≡ (Event2 → not(Event2)), which is equivalent to not(Event2).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ not(C3) ≡ not(not(Event2)) ≡ Event2 happens.

Step 3 — use the context
- Context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So Event2 happens is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- Since Event2 happens is true, C4 (which is equivalent to Event2 happens) is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Start: event2 has happened initially. The statements ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen"" mean that once event2 occurs there is no next state with further events. So there is no next state in which event1 could occur.

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is false because there is no next state after event2.

- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially) but C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 is false.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is false, so this implication is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). Hence C3 is true now.

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds in the initial state, so it holds (immediately), and therefore eventually holds.

Thus C4 is True.
---
Answer: True

Brief justification (concise, non-sensitive reasoning):
- From the context, event2 has already happened initially and both event1 and event2 are terminal (no further events can occur after either). So there are no subsequent events after the initial state.
- C1 (event1 happens in the next state): False, because no events can occur after event2.
- C2 (if event2 happens then C1 holds): False, because event2 does happen but C1 is false.
- C3 (if C2 holds then event1 happens): True, vacuously true because C2 is false.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds): True, because C3 already holds in the current (initial) state, so it holds ""eventually.""

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event2 occurred. By the premises, after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 does not occur in the next state (and never occurs afterwards).
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""if event2 happens, then C1 holds""): the antecedent is true (event2 did happen) but the consequent is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 (""if C2 holds, then event1 happens""): its antecedent (C2 holds) is false, so the implication is vacuously true — C3 holds now.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true because C3 already holds in the current state."

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can ever happen. So event2 does not happen — C1 is true.

2. C2 says ""C1 always holds."" Because event2 never happens, C1 does indeed always hold, so C2 is true.

3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

4. C4 is the implication ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Also, C3 is actually false in this scenario, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is True or False given the context and the other claims C1–C3.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 ever occurred, event1 must also occur (but event1 already did initially).

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after that, event2 cannot occur. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event2 cannot ever happen under the context, C1 indeed always holds. So C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 is True, C3 is False.

Step 4 — Evaluate C4
- C4 is the implication: if C3 holds then event2 happens (C3 → event2).
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C3 is false, C4 is True regardless of whether event2 can happen.

Final answer: True
---
You are asking whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false.

Step 1 — understand the events:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (and it happens initially), no later occurrence of any event is possible.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" imposes that if event2 were to occur, event1 must occur afterward — but event1 already occurred initially, and no events can occur after that, so event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is true (event2 is impossible given the constraints).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since event2 cannot happen in any possible sequence, C1 indeed always holds; so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This negates a true statement, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C3 is false). In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).

Conclusion: C4 is True."

We are asked whether C4 is true or false.

1) Interpret conditions:
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalent to ""event1 does not happen"".
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" — eventually ""event1 does not happen"".
- C4 = ""C3 holds or event1 happens"".

2) Use the context:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does happen.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so nothing can make ""event1 does not happen"" become true later.

3) Evaluate:
- C1 is true (event1 happens).
- C2 is false.
- C3 is false (C2 never becomes true).
- C4 is true because its right disjunct ""event1 happens"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- The question asks whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalent to ""event1 does not happen.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — ""at some point (in the future) event1 does not happen.""
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — a disjunction: (C3) OR (event1 happens).

Step 3 — use the context to trace events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will happen.
- After event1 no other events can happen → irrelevant for the truth of event1 itself.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- Since event1 does happen, the disjunction C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true regardless of C3.

Final answer:
True

Goal: decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is True or False given the context.

1) From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (and after event1 no further events can occur).

2) C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"". Because event1 does happen, C1 is True.

3) C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False (and cannot later become true because event1 has already happened).

4) C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". C2 is never true, so C3 is False.

5) C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"". Even though C3 is False, event1 does happen, so the disjunction is True.

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked: whether C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Interpretation and trace of states:
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- s1 (next): by ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 happens in s1.
- s2 (after event2): by ""after event2, no other events can happen"", no events happen in s2.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - At s0, C1 is true (event2 happens in s1).
  - At s1, C1 is false (event2 does not happen in s2).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This is false because C1 fails at s1.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" At s1 event2 happens but C2 is false, so C3 is false (it fails at s1).
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" At s0 event1 happens but C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Conclusion: False

We are asked whether C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is true given the scenario.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context:
   - Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event2 occurs).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there is no later state where event2 happens again).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
   - At the initial state this is true (because event1 happened initially and event2 must follow).

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, event2 happens in the next state).
   - This is false. After the state where event2 has occurred, there is no next-state event2 (no further events happen), so C1 is not true at those later states. Therefore C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""
   - This requires that whenever event2 occurs, C2 (that C1 always holds) is true. But at the state where event2 actually happens, C2 is false (from step 3). So C3 is false.

5. Evaluate C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds.""
   - Event1 does happen (initially), but C3 is false. Therefore the implication fails and C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- At the initial state event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can ever happen (so once event1 has occurred, all future states have no events).
- After event2, event1 must happen — but event2 never occurs here because event1 already happened initially and that prevents any further events.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the initial event1 and the rule that no events occur afterward, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false at the initial state (and at every state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is never true at any future time (event1 only happened initially and never again), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false in every state, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false (already false at the initial state), C4 is false.

We want to know whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Context restated:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Recall the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: eventually C1 holds (i.e., at some future state, event1 holds in that state's next state).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.
- C4: C3 holds at every state (always).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the initial state event1 has happened. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" there are no further events after this point (in particular, nothing forces any further occurrence of event1 in the next state).
2. Therefore at the initial state, C1 is false: event1 does not necessarily happen in the next state.
3. Since no further events occur, there is no future state in which C1 becomes true. So C2 (""eventually C1"") is false.
4. If C2 is false at the initial state, then C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is also false at the initial state (it requires C2 to hold from the next state).
5. C4 requires C3 to hold at every state. But C3 already fails at the initial state, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. What is being asked:
   - C4 is ""C3 always holds"" (i.e. at every state C3 is true). We must decide whether this is true given the context.

2. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so from that point onward there are no further events).
   - The rule about event2 is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (no events after event1).

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given there are no events after the initial event1, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false at the initial state.
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never becomes true in any future state (no events occur), C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false in every future state, C3 is false at the initial state.
   - C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is already false at the initial state, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Interpret the context and formulas
- Context (trace): initially event2 happens (state s0). After event2, event1 must happen, so the next state s1 has event1. After event1 no other events can happen, so s1 is terminal (no further state).
- C1: ""event1 or event1"" ≡ event1. So C1 is true exactly in states where event1 holds (true in s1, false in s0).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ X C1. At s0 this is true because the next state s1 has event1; at s1 this is false because there is no next state (X-formulas are false in a terminal state).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" ≡ G C2. For G C2 to hold at a state, C2 must hold at that state and all future states. At s0, although C2 holds at s0, C2 fails at s1, so C3 is false at s0. At s1 C2 is already false, so C3 is false there as well. So C3 never holds on the trace.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ F C3. Since C3 is false at every state on the trace, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

1. Interpret the Cs:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event1 happens"", which is just Event1 (a tautology collapsed to the proposition ""event1 holds"").
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = next(event1).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" = always(next(event1)): at every state, the next state has event1.
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" = eventually(always(next(event1))).

2. Use the context:
- Initially event2 holds (so event1 does not hold initially).
- The system must eventually perform event1 (after event2, event1 must happen).
- After event1, no other events can happen — i.e. once event1 occurs the run terminates (or at least no future states where events occur).

3. Evaluate C3 and C4:
- C3 requires that at every state the next state satisfies event1. That is impossible in any run that contains a terminal state (a state after event1) because at that terminal state there is no next state where event1 holds (the ""next"" condition fails). Thus always(next(event1)) cannot hold over an infinite future that includes the post-event1 terminal point.
- C4 asks whether eventually there is a point after which always(next(event1)) holds. There is no such point: before event1, next(event1) may hold at that one predecessor state, but after event1 occurs the required next(event1) fails; thus you cannot reach a suffix of the run where always(next(event1)) is true.

Therefore C4 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 says ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true at every moment (i.e., whether C3 holds at all times given the scenario).

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial moment event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur at any later time).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never actually occurs in this scenario.

Step 3 — examine C1–C4
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" At the initial moment this is true because event2 happens then.
- C2 is the same as C1, so also true at the initial moment.
- C3 is C1 and C2, so true at the initial moment.
- C4 requires C3 to hold at every moment in time.

Step 4 — trace the timeline
At times after the initial moment no events occur. Interpreting ""eventX happens"" as an instantaneous occurrence that is true only at the moment the event occurs, at any later time neither ""event1 happens"" nor ""event2 happens"" is true. Therefore C1 (and C2, and hence C3) are false at those later times.

Conclusion
C3 does not hold at all times, so C4 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis asks whether C3 (""C1 holds and C2 holds"") is true at all times (i.e., C4: ""C3 always holds"").
- C1 and C2 are the same: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 and C2 are true at the initial moment, hence C3 is true initially.
- But the context also says that after event2 no other events can happen. At any later time no event occurs, so at those times ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" is false.
- Therefore C3 does not hold at all times, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.
---
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the scenario.

Examine the context and each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the start).
  - After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur after that initial event2).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (a constraint that would force event2 to follow any event1).
- Hypothesis:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
  - C2: same as C1.
  - C3: C1 and C2 (so equivalent to C1).
  - C4: ""C3 always holds.""

Trace and reason through event sequences
- At the initial moment event2 happens.
- Because no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur later.
- Event1 could not have occurred before the initial event2 (the statement says event2 happened initially), so event1 does not occur anywhere in the timeline.
- Event2 does occur (initially), so the disjunction ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" is true.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are true, so C3 is true.
- Nothing in the future can change (no further events), and the fact ""event2 happened"" remains true, so C3 continues to hold at all times.

Conclusion
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 eventually happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" From the context (event2 happened and after event2 event1 must happen), C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" That means C3 is the negation of C2; since C2 is False, C3 is True. (Note also C3 is logically equivalent to C1.)
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" C3 is True (independently), so the implication is True. Also, if event1 happens then C1 holds (event1 occurring implies event1 eventually happens), and C3 ≡ C1, so the implication holds in any case.

Final answer: True

First identify the question: C4 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Reasoning step by step:
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen. From this, event1 does indeed happen. 
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Negating C2 (which is False) makes C3 True.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" Event1 happens (antecedent true) and C3 holds (consequent true), so the implication is True.

Final answer: True
---
Goal: determine truth of C4.

Context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Trace:
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen, event1 does happen.
- Once event1 happens, nothing else happens (but that doesn't affect truth of the claims below).

Evaluate conditions:
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens""): True (we showed event1 must happen).
- C2 (""C1 does not hold""): False (contradicts C1).
- C3 (""C2 does not hold""): True (since C2 is false).
- C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds""): True. C3 is true in the scenario, so the implication holds (antecedent true and consequent true).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no events (including event2) can ever occur afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant here because event2 will not occur.)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 never happens in this execution. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true (indeed true at every time).
2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately (and forever), there is certainly some future time at which C1 holds — so C2 holds now (and in fact at every time).
3. C3 is ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 holds at every time (from step 2), C3 is true.
4. C4 is ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true at every time, C4 is also true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C4 is true or false given the context. C4 says ""C3 always holds."" We must evaluate the chain C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 under the given event rules.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened (so at the start of the trace event1 has occurred).
  - After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs, the trace has no further events).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).
- C1: Event2 does not happen (i.e., event2 never occurs in the trace).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some future point at which C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (at every point in time, C2 is true).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (at every point, C3 is true).

Step 3 — trace reasoning
Because event1 happens initially and no events can happen after event1, there are no occurrences of any other events (including event2) anywhere in the trace. Therefore event2 never occurs, so C1 is true right away.

If C1 is true at the start, then C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true (it already holds now). Since C1 is globally true for the whole trace, at every point you will still have C2 true, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true. And likewise C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

(The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

Final answer
True
---
You are asking whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Interpretation used: ""Initially, event1 happened"" means at time 0 event1 has occurred. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred there are no further events ever. ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant once event1 already happened and forbids events after that.

Step-by-step:
- From ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and the fact that event1 happened initially, no event (and in particular event2) can ever occur at any later time.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e. event2 never occurs) is true.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds from the start (so it holds at some time — now).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true because at every time point C2 is true (event2 never occurs from any point onward).
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is therefore true (it just repeats the same always-claim).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 holds in the initial/current state.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (There is no successor state after a state where event1 has happened.)
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the initial event1.)
- Hypothesis formulas:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this simplifies to: event1 (so C1 is true in the initial state).
  - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this requires a successor state in which event1 holds.
  - C3: same as C1, so C3 is true in the initial state.
  - C4: C2 or C3.

Step 3 — reason about event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there is no next state. Thus C2 (""C1 in the next state"") is false (the next-state requirement cannot be satisfied).
- C3 is true (same as C1, true in the initial state).

Step 4 — final evaluation
- C4 = C2 or C3 = false or true = true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 happens (tautological repetition).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ Event1 happens in the next state.
- C3: same text as C1, so C3 ≡ Event1 happens (in the current/checked state).
- C4: C2 or C3 ≡ (Event1 happens in the next state) or (Event1 happens now).

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially, Event1 happened — so C3 (Event1 happens now) is true.
- After Event1, no other events can happen, so even if there is a next state, Event1 does not happen there (so C2 is false). If one treats ""no next state"" as well, C2 is also false.
- Regardless, C3 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 = C2 or C3 is true because C3 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens"".
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 also simplifies to ""Event1 happens"".
- The context states that initially event1 happened, so C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". Since C3 is true, the disjunction C4 is true regardless of C2."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: event2 has occurred and therefore event1 must occur sometime afterwards. So C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true at the moment event1 occurs (C1 is true and event1 indeed happens).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") would require C2 to be true at every moment. But before event1 occurs, C2 is false (event1 hasn't happened yet), and after the single occurrence of event1 there are no further events — so there is no time interval from which C2 is true at every future moment. Therefore C3 never becomes true.
- Hence C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false.

First identify what's asked: C4 says ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future time C2 will hold at all times thereafter.

Examine the conditions and the scenario:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so event1 will eventually occur. Therefore C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" At the instant event1 occurs both parts are true, so C2 is true at that instant.
- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — that would require C2 to be true at every moment. But C2 is only true at the instant of event1 (before that instant event1 is not happening; after that instant it is not continually happening), so C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" — that would require there to be a time after which C2 holds forever. Since C2 only holds at the instantaneous occurrence of event1 and does not persist, there is no time from which C2 is true at all future moments.

Conclusion: C4 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- We must determine the truth of C4, which is ""C3 holds or event1 happens.""

Examine the given facts:
1. Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
2. After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur at any later point.
3. After event2, no other events can happen — irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given (2), event2 cannot happen after the initial event1, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — false AND false → false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — false OR true → true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify question:
- We must determine whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
  (The second statement is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur if event1 already forbids further events.)

Step 3 — examine conditions:
- C1: Event2 always happens. Given that event1 happened initially and prevents further events, event2 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: Event2 always happens. Same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. False AND false → false.
- C4: C3 holds or event1 happens. Even though C3 is false, event1 does happen (initially), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

- The rule about ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") — false, because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- C2 — same as C1, false.
- C3 (C1 and C2) — false (both conjuncts false).
- C4 (C3 or event1) — event1 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of C3.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 asserts ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 asserts ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 asserts ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" C1 asserts ""Event1 does not happen."" So C4 amounts to: eventually (eventually (Event2 happens and (Event1 never happens))). In linear time, nested ""eventually"" collapses, so C4 is equivalent to ""eventually (Event2 happens and Event1 never happens)"".

Step 2 — use the context
Context: initially Event2 happened, and whenever Event2 happens then Event1 must happen afterward, and whenever Event1 happens then Event2 must happen afterward. In particular, because Event2 happened initially, Event1 must occur at some later time. Therefore the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false in this scenario.

Step 3 — propagate truth values
Since C1 is false, C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") can never be true. Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false, and so is C4.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- The rules force alternation: after any event2, an event1 must occur; after any event1, an event2 must occur. So starting from the initial event2, event1 must happen at some later time (and then event2 again, and so on).

Step 2 — examine C1–C4:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” and the initial event2, event1 must occur, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" C2 requires C1; since C1 is false, C2 cannot hold.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 never holds, then C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 never holds, then C4 is also false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the context, event2 happened initially, and the rules force that after any event2, event1 must happen. So because event2 has already occurred, event1 will (inevitably) happen later. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.

2. C2 is ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Although event2 does happen, C1 is false, so C2 is false (it cannot hold).

3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 never holds, C3 is false.

4. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is false and never becomes true, C4 is also false.

Thus C4 is False."

Answering: Is C4 true or false?

Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 states ""C3 eventually holds."" We must determine whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and similarly after event1 no other events can happen).
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2. There is no indication event1 happened before that, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is impossible because C1 asserts event1 does not happen; therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Event2 did happen (initially), so C3 is true (regardless of C2).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is true at the initial time (event2 has happened), C3 holds at some time — hence it eventually holds.

Conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
You ask whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus event1 cannot occur (there is no time after event2 for it to happen, and nothing earlier is given). So C1 (event1 does not happen) is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — that requires event1 to happen despite C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 holds or event2 happens"". Since event2 did happen initially, C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"". C3 already holds now (because event2 happened), so it certainly holds eventually.

Therefore C4 is True. Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Given ""initially event2 happened"" and event2 is terminal, no further events can ever occur; in particular, event1 never happens.

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is True AND False → False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is False, but event2 happens (it happened initially) → C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds (at the initial time because event2 happened), so ""eventually"" is satisfied (there exists a time — now — where C3 holds). Therefore C4 is True.

True"

True.

Reasoning step-by-step (discrete states s0 = initial, s1 = next, s2 = next of next):

- Given: initially (s0) event2 happened. Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" so in s1, s2, ... no events occur.
- C1: ""event2 and event1 happen"" — at any state after s0 (including s2) neither event occurs, so C1 is false at s2.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — when evaluated at s1 this says ""C1 holds at s2"", which is false (as just shown).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — at s1 this is true because C2 is false at s1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — evaluated at s0 this requires C3 to hold at s1; we found C3 true at s1, so C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

You are asking whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Context summary:
  - Initially (at the initial state s0) event2 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred the system is terminal with respect to further events).

- Evaluate C1–C4 from s0:
  - C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" Since only event2 happened initially and no further events can occur after event2, event1 does not happen anywhere. So C1 is false at s0 (and in every future state).
  - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Because C1 is false in every state, C2 is false at s0.
  - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false at s0, C3 is true at s0.
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" In the next state (s1) the situation is the same (no events can occur after the initial event2), so C2 is false in s1 and therefore C3 is true in s1. Hence C4 is true at s0.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- You ask whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — restate the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event2 happened. (So event2 does happen.)
- C1: event2 does not happen.
- C2: event2 does not happen.
- C3: C2 does not hold (i.e., not(C2) → event2 does happen).
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds (i.e., (not event2) OR (event2)).

- From the context, event2 did happen. Therefore C1 is false and C2 is false.
- C3 is “C2 does not hold”; since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4 is C1 OR C3 → false OR true → true.

Conclusion
True
---
Goal: determine truth of C4 = (C1 holds) or (C3 holds).

Step 1 — interpret conditions
- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 did occur.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" → claims event2 did not occur.
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 says event2 does not happen, C3 says event2 does happen.
- C4: C1 or C3 (i.e., ""event2 does not happen"" OR ""event2 does happen"").

Step 2 — evaluate under the context
- From the context, event2 did happen. Therefore:
  - C1 is false.
  - C2 is false.
  - C3 (C2 does not hold) is true.

Step 3 — conclude C4
- C4 = C1 or C3 = false or true = true.

Final answer: True
---
Identify the hypothesis and its pieces
- C1: ¬E2 (event2 does not happen)
- C2: ¬E2 (same as C1)
- C3: ¬C2, i.e. ¬(¬E2) which is E2 (event2 happens)
- C4: C1 ∨ C3, i.e. (¬E2) ∨ E2

Use the context
- The context states “Initially, event2 happened.” So E2 is true.
- The other context sentences (after event1 → event2; after event2 no other events) don’t change that E2 occurred initially.

Evaluate the conditions
- C1 (¬E2) is false because E2 is true.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 = ¬C2, so C3 is true (since C2 is false).
- C4 = C1 ∨ C3 = false ∨ true = true.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1) Interpret the context in temporal terms:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2) Translate the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" = globally/eventually-for-all-future states event1 holds (G event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = in the next state, G event1 holds (X G event1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = at some future state X G event1 holds (F X G event1).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = not (F X G event1).

3) Check satisfiability under the context:
- Because event2 must occur sometime after the initial event1 and after event2 no events can happen, there is some future state where event1 does not happen. Thus G event1 (C1) is false at the initial state and at every state (there is no suffix of the run where event1 holds at all future states).
- Therefore X G event1 (C2) is false at every state, so there is no state where C2 becomes true.
- Hence F X G event1 (C3) is false.

4) Conclusion:
- C3 does not hold, so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Let p = ""event1 happens"", q = ""event2 happens"".
- Sequence forced by the context: initial state s0 with p true; after event1, event2 must happen, so next state s1 has q true; after event2 no other events can happen, so there are no further states with p true. So the only possible run is: s0 (p) → s1 (q) → terminal (no p).
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") means p holds in every state (globally). This is false: p holds at s0 but not at s1 (or any later state).
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is false at s0 because C1 is already false at s1.
- C3 (C2 eventually holds) is false because there is no future state where C1 holds, so C2 never becomes true.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is therefore true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpret the context as a single trace: state0 where event1 has happened, then at some later state event2 must happen, and after event2 the trace is terminal (no further events).
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means event1 holds at every state (globally). This is false: state0 has event1, but after event2 (and already at the state where event2 occurs) event1 does not hold.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1) is false at the initial state because C1 is not true from the next state onward.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2) is false because C2 is never true on the trace.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" is therefore true.

Thus C4 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context timeline rules:
  - Initially, event2 happened (call this state0).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (so state1 has event1).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (so state2 has event2), and the pattern continues.
- Hypothesis:
  - C1: event1 happens in the next state.
  - C2: event1 happens in the next state. (C1 and C2 are the same.)
  - C3: C1 and C2 — equivalently, event1 happens in the next state.
  - C4: If C3 holds, then event2 happens.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- state0: event2 (given).
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"" → state1: event1. Thus C1 and C2 (event1 in the next state relative to state0) are true, so C3 is true.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"" → since event1 holds in state1, event2 will hold in state2.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C3 holds (event1 in the next state), and that guarantees event2 in the subsequent state. Therefore the implication ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened (call that state S0). After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state S1 we must have event1). After event1, event2 must happen (so in the state after that, S2, we must have event2).
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state. Given event2 happened in S0, C1 is true (event1 must happen in S1).
- C2: Same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: C1 and C2 both hold — thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" We need to see whether C3 being true guarantees event2.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- S0: event2 (given).
- S1: by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 occurs (so C1/C2/C3 true).
- S2: by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C3 holds (it guarantees event1 in S1), and that event1 in S1 forces event2 in S2, C3 implies event2 (in the subsequent state). Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
The hypothesis asks whether the implication C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Context: initially event2 occurs. The rules state (a) after event2, event1 must happen, and (b) after event1, event2 must happen. So event2 -> event1 -> event2 (and so on).
2. Conditions:
   - C1: event1 happens in the next state.
   - C2: event1 happens in the next state. (same as C1)
   - C3: C1 and C2 hold, so event1 happens in the next state.
3. If C3 holds, then event1 happens in the next state. By the context rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 will therefore happen in the state after that next state.
4. Thus C3 implies that event2 will happen (after the next state), so the implication in C4 is true.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false.

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" means C3 holds at some time in the future (including now).

Step 3 — trace the events
- Initially event2 happened; after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never occurs. That does not affect the truth of C1/C2 because they are vacuously true when event1 does not occur.

Step 1 — what is asked
You ask whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P); it is true in every state regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.  
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology and therefore true.  
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.  
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is already true (in fact true at all times), it certainly holds at some time (now), so ""eventually C3"" is true.

Step 3 — role of the context
The context (initially event2 happened; after event1 or event2 no other events can happen) only restricts possible event sequences (in particular event1 will not occur after the initial event2) but does not affect the tautological truth of C1/C2 nor the truth of C3.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
The question asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" ""Eventually"" is satisfied if C3 holds now or at some future point. C3 holds now, so it certainly ""eventually holds.""

Step 3 — consider the context
The context (initially event2 happened; after event1 or event2 no further events can happen) does not invalidate the above: even though event1 never actually occurs, C1 and C2 remain true (they are tautologies / vacuously true), so C3 holds immediately.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The question asks whether C4 (Event1 happens or C3 holds) is true given the context and the conditions C1–C3.
- From the context: event2 happened initially. The rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" force event1 to occur after the initial event2 (and then event2 again, etc.). So both events occur. Therefore C1 (Event1 happens and event2 happens) is true.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because at the initial moment event1 had not yet happened, so C1 did not hold at all times. Thus C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
- C4 is ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"". Since event1 does happen (and also C3 holds), the disjunction is true.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: event2 happened initially. The rules force alternation: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So both event1 and event2 do occur (in fact they alternate indefinitely). Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") is true.

- C2 asserts ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as a global/for-all-times claim, C1 does not hold at every instant (events occur at moments, and there are times when the conjunction is not true), so C2 is false.

- C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

- C4 is ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" Since C3 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of the first disjunct.

Hence C4 is True.

- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- Thus the execution produces event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, … — i.e., both events occur (and they alternate).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the alternating sequence, both events do occur at some points, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""globally/at every point in the execution"": C1 being ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" is not true at every instant (events are occurrences at particular times), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" We already have Event1 happens (true) and C3 holds (true), so the disjunction is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so ""event2"" is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (unused here).
- After event2, no other events can happen (unused here).

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a material tautology (P → P), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is true, so the implication holds (and also event2 is true anyway), therefore C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — Determine C4
- C4 is ""C2 or C3"". Since C2 (and C3) are true, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 is true, where C4 = (C2 holds) or (C3 holds).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p); it is true in every model/trace.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is also true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Because C1 is true unconditionally, the implication in C2 is true as well (an implication with a true consequent is true, and here the consequent C1 is true regardless of the antecedent).

Step 3 — trace/event-sequence check (consistency with context)
- The context states event2 happens initially and no events follow; that does not contradict any of the above — it only reinforces that antecedents like ""event2 happens"" can be true, but we already relied on the logical tautologies.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- Both C2 and C3 hold, so C4 (C2 or C3) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication p → p, so C1 is always true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is always true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the implication event2 → C1 is also true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

Step 3 — combine
- C3 is true (independent of the context), and C2 is also true. Therefore C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- After event2, event1 must happen — but event2 cannot occur because event1 already happened and prevents further events.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — effectively requires event2 to happen. Given the context, event2 cannot happen (because event1 already happened and forbids further events). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — C1 is false, event1 did happen, so C2 is false (false AND true = false).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C2 is false, C3 is true (it already holds).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — C3 holds now, so it certainly holds eventually.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain C1–C3.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (and it did initially), no further events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 were to happen, event1 must happen as well.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- Given the context, event2 cannot happen (because event1 already happened initially and blocks any further events). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (regardless of event1).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is a material implication whose antecedent (C2) is false, so the implication is true. Thus C3 already holds (true) immediately.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 holds right now, it certainly holds at some time in the future (i.e., eventually). So C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true now).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events can occur at any later time).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 were to occur, event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C4
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this just asserts event2 happens. Given the context, event2 cannot happen (event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after it), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event1 is true).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true now (vacuously).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — C3 already holds now, so C3 does eventually hold. Therefore C4 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — translate the conditions:
- C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (G C1).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (G C2, equivalently G G C1).
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3).

Step 2 — trace the system:
- Initial state s0: event2 has happened.
- By the rules, event1 must happen after event2, so there is a next state s1 where event1 occurs.
- After event1 no further states exist (s1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate the formulas:
- At s1, event1 occurs now, so F event1 (C1) is true at s1 (because the eventuality is satisfied at the current state). Therefore G C1 (C2) is true at s1 (only s1 needs to satisfy C1), and likewise G C2 (C3) is true at s1.
- At s0 the next state is s1, and we just established C3 holds at s1. Therefore X C3 (C4) is true at s0.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

True
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Let s0 be the initial state (event2 happened). By the context, event1 must then occur; let s1 be the state where event1 occurs, and after that let s2, s3, ... be states with no further events.

2. C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).  
   - C1 is true at s0 (event1 occurs at s1). C1 is also true at s1 (event1 already holds at the current state if F is allowed to include the current state), but C1 is false at s2, s3, ... because no further event1 occurs there.

3. C2 = G(C1) = ""always C1"" (in every state, eventually event1).  
   - C2 is false: at s2 (and subsequent states) C1 is false, so C2 fails.

4. C3 = G(C2) = ""always C2"".  
   - Since C2 is already false at some states, C3 is false.

5. C4 = X(C3) = ""C3 holds in the next state"" (evaluated at s0).  
   - The next state s1 does not satisfy C3 (C3 is false), so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

So both event2 and event1 occur.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: event2 or event1 → true (both occur).
- C2: if C1 then event2 → antecedent true and event2 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: if event1 then C2 → event1 is true and C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: C3 or event2 → C3 is true (and event2 is true), so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C4 (""C3 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 is also true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (not needed further here).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""event2 or event1"" — true (both are true).
- C2: ""if C1 then event2"" — true (C1 is true and event2 is true).
- C3: ""if event1 then C2"" — true (event1 is true and C2 is true).
- C4: ""C3 or event2"" — true (both C3 and event2 are true, so the disjunction is true).

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked:
We must determine whether C4 (""C3 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — facts from the context:
- event2 happens (initially).
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant for truth of these propositions since both events already occurred).

So event2 = True and event1 = True.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: event2 or event1. Since both events occur, C1 = True.
- C2: if C1 then event2. C1 is True and event2 is True, so the implication C2 is True.
- C3: if event1 then C2. event1 is True and C2 is True, so C3 is True.
- C4: C3 or event2. C3 is True and event2 is True, so C4 = True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the formulas
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (F event2).
- C2: same as C1: F event2.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = F(C2) = F(F event2).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" = (F event2) -> F(F event2).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened, so F event2 is true right now (event2 already occurred).
- Therefore C1 and C2 are true in the current state.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- Since C2 is true now, ""eventually C2"" (F C2) is true (there is a time — now — where C2 holds). So C3 is true.
- More generally, in temporal logic F p implies F(F p) (if p holds at some future time, then there is a future time at which ""p holds at some future time"" — take that same time).

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- Because C1 holds and C3 holds, the implication C1 -> C3 is true.
- And as noted, F p -> F(F p) is valid in general, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus nothing new happens after the initial moment.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since event2 has already happened initially, C1 is true (eventually includes the present).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is already true now, so there is some time (the present) at which C2 holds; therefore C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is the implication (C1 → C3). We have C1 true and C3 true, so the implication is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 happens at the initial point of the run.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: same as C1, so also True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is already true (event2 happens), C3 holds as well (eventually(C2) is true whenever C2 is true now — equivalently F(F p) = F p).

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C1 is true and C3 is true in the given scenario, so the implication ""If C1 then C3"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 is ""C1 holds or C3 holds"". We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and context
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction is a repetition).
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some time (including now) C2 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds.""

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
- Since event1 happened initially, the proposition ""Event1 happens"" is true now. Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true at the initial point.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true because C2 already holds (eventually can be satisfied immediately).
- Thus at least one disjunct of C4 is true (in fact both are true).

Conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C3 holds"". We must determine whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., there exists some time where C2 (hence ""Event1 happens"") holds.
- Context: initially Event1 happened. After Event1, Event2 must happen. After Event2, no other events can happen.
  → So Event1 does indeed happen (at the initial moment).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1 is true (Event1 happens initially).
- C2 is true (same as C1).
- C3 is true as well, because C2 holds at the initial time (there exists a time when C2 holds, so ""eventually"" is satisfied).
- Therefore C4 = (C1 or C3) is true because C1 is true (and C3 is true too).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no further events can occur.
So the actual event sequence is: event1 occurs (initially), then event2 occurs, then nothing else.

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a repetition of the same fact; it reduces to ""event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 does happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds (event1 happens initially), C3 is true (it holds now, hence eventually).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" At least one disjunct (in fact both) is true.

- C4 says: ""C3 eventually holds."" We must determine whether, given the context, C3 will hold at some future point.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication, so C1 holds at all times.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 always holds, C2 holds exactly at those times when event1 holds.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 holds exactly at times when event1 does not hold.

Step 3 — use the context to trace events
- Initially event1 happened, so at the initial moment event1 is true and thus C2 is true there (C3 false).
- The rules force alternation: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So the sequence is event1 (initial), then event2, then event1, then event2, ...
- At the next moment when event2 happens, event1 is false, so C2 is false and therefore C3 is true at that later time.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C3 becomes true at a future time (immediately after the initial event1), so ""C3 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context implies an infinite alternating sequence: event1 occurs initially, then event2 must occur after it, then event1 after that, and so on (event1, event2, event1, ...).
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p) and holds.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen (initially and repeatedly) and C1 holds, so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false and there is no change that would make C2 stop holding, C3 never becomes true. Therefore C4 is false.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition using the context
- Context: initially event1 has happened. After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because event1 already happened initially (eventually includes the current state).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts C2 holds in every state (including the initial state). Since C2 is False now, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Because C3 is False, C4 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 asserts ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and the Ci
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true in the initial state.
C2 is the same, so C2 is also true initially.
C3 = C1 and C2, so C3 is true in the initial state.

Step 3 — consider the ""next state""
Because event2 is terminal, there is no subsequent state in which another event occurs. If there is no next state at all, a ""next"" claim (X φ) is false. If one allows a next state that simply has no events happening there, then in that next state neither event1 nor event2 ""happens,"" so C1 and C2 would be false there, and hence C3 would be false.

Either interpretation yields the same result: C3 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer
False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially, event2 happened, so C1 (""event2 or event1"") is true in the initial state. C2 is the same, so C2 is also true. Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is true in the initial state.
- The context says that after event2 no other events can happen. That means in the next state neither event2 nor event1 occurs.
- Therefore in the next state C1 and C2 are both false, so C3 is false in the next state.
- C4 asserts that C3 holds in the next state; since C3 is false there, C4 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 asserts: ""C3 holds in the next state."" The question: is C4 True or False?

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3 now
- Initially event2 happened. So ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" is true now. Thus C1 is true, C2 is true, and C3 (C1 and C2) is true in the initial state.

Step 3 — consider the next state
- The context says ""after event2, no other events can happen"" (and similarly for event1). That means the state reached after the initial event is terminal — there is no subsequent state in which to evaluate properties.
- In standard temporal semantics, ""X holds in the next state"" is true only if a next state exists and X holds there. If there is no next state, ""next X"" is false.

Conclusion
- Because there is no next state after the initial (terminal) event2, C3 cannot hold in a next state. Therefore C4 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event2 has occurred, and after event2 no other events can occur. So the only reachable state is the initial one where event2 holds; there are no further states/transitions.
- C1 (""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is vacuously true in this model because event1 never occurs in any reachable state.
- C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens) is true, since C1 holds and event2 does happen in the initial state.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is false: there is no next state (no transitions after the initial state), so C2 cannot be true in a next state.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because there is no current or future state where C3 is true.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no further events can occur. Also, after event1 no further events can occur. So the system is in a state where event2 has already occurred and there are no successor states.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Event1 never actually happens in the run (there are no further events after the initial event2), so this implication is vacuously true. Thus C1 holds.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" We have just established C1 holds, and event2 did happen initially, so C2 is true in the initial state.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can occur after event2), so C2 cannot hold in a next state. Therefore C3 is false.

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since there are no future states in which C3 could become true, C3 does not eventually hold. Therefore C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The context says initially event2 happened, and once event2 happens no further events can occur (also event1, if it happens, would be terminal).
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is vacuously true in the initial state (event1 does not happen there).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" That is true in the initial state (C1 true and event2 did happen initially).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" For C2 to hold in the next state we would need event2 to hold (i.e., happen) in that next state. But after event2 there are no further events — event2 does not (and cannot) happen again in any future state. So C2 is false in the next state.
- Therefore C3 never becomes true in any future state, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false."

We must decide whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: Event1 happens or Event2 happens.
- C2: Event1 happens or Event2 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 and C2, so C3 = (Event1 or Event2) and (Event1 or Event2) = Event1 or Event2.
- C4: Event2 happens or C3 = Event2 or (Event1 or Event2) = Event1 or Event2.

Step 4 — conclude:
Since Event2 happens is true, C1 and C2 are true, hence C3 is true, and C4 (Event2 or C3) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the context and what it implies
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true at least at the initial moment.
- The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" imply the events alternate, so both event1 and event2 occur (event2 initially, then event1, then event2, etc.). In particular, event2 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event2 happens, C1 is true.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Both are true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Event2 happens (true), and C3 holds (true), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Identify the hypothesis:
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 is True or False, where
  - C1: Event1 happens or Event2 happens.
  - C2: Event1 happens or Event2 happens.
  - C3: C1 holds and C2 holds.
  - C4: Event2 happens or C3 holds.

Examine the context and conditions:
- Initially Event2 has happened.
- Rule A: After Event1 occurs, Event2 must happen (so any Event1 is followed by an Event2).
- Rule B: After Event2 occurs, Event1 must happen (so any Event2 is followed by an Event1).

Trace the event sequence:
- Since Event2 has happened initially, by Rule B an Event1 must occur next.
- After that Event1, by Rule A an Event2 must occur next.
- This forces an alternating sequence Event2, Event1, Event2, Event1, ... so both Event1 and Event2 do occur (in fact infinitely often).

Evaluate the clauses:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens"" — true, because both happen.
- C2: same as C1 — true.
- C3: C1 and C2 — true (both true).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — true, because Event2 does happen (and C3 also holds).

The question asks whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus the only possible sequence is: event2 occurs (initially), then event1 occurs, then stop.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is ¬C1, so true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 asserts that event2 happened (¬C1). That is a fact of the run and cannot be undone later, so C2 remains true at all times; therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is ¬C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Answer: False

Explanation (concise, non-sensitive reasoning):
- Context: event2 happens initially; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no further events occur.
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false because event2 did happen.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is therefore true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds""): since C1 is false (event2 did occur), C2 is true in all states, so C3 is true.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is the negation of a true statement, so C4 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurred in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus no events (including event1 again or event2) can occur in any later state.
- The clause about ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in this scenario.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is false, because after the initial event1 no events can happen in the next state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false in the initial/next state, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C2 is false and event2 never happens), so C3 is false in all states.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 never holds at any time, ""eventually C3"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" Because event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can ever occur after that initial moment.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after that, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 is false (it does not hold in the next state), C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false: C2 is false, and event2 cannot occur (no events can happen after event1). So C3 is false at all times.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 never holds, C4 is false.

Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 has already happened.
- Once event1 has happened, no further events can occur.
- Also, if event2 were to happen, no further events could occur (but that doesn't matter since event1 already happened).

Step 2 — evaluate C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state""):
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after that, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 (""C1 always holds""):
- C1 is false at the next state, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens""):
- C2 is false, and event2 cannot happen after event1, so event2 will not occur. Thus C3 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C4 (""C3 eventually holds""):
- C3 is never true in the future, so C4 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context forces alternation: initially event2 happened (call that state 0), and after every event2 event1 must occur, and after every event1 event2 must occur. So in the next state (state 1) event1 must occur.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, event1 must happen in the next state, so C1 is false.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context and conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the state immediately following the initial state, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen, and so on (events alternate).

Step 3 — Examine the hypothesis conditions
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., at every future state).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, C1 always holds from that point on).
- C4: C3 does not hold.

Step 4 — Trace and reason
- From the context, in the next state (right after the initial state) event1 does happen. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in that next state.
- Because C1 is false in that next state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (it fails at least at that next state).
- Thus C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C4 asserts that C3 does not hold. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
First identify the question: C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Examine the context and conditions:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So the execution must alternate: event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, event1 must occur (right after the initial event2), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event1 never happens). Since event1 must happen, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is false (and in the next state event1 actually happens), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Step-by-step:

1. Context gives: event2 happened initially.
2. Context also says: after event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 did happen, event1 eventually happens.
3. Therefore C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true. C2 states the same as C1, so C2 is true.
4. C3 says: if C2 holds then event2 happens. C2 does hold and event2 did happen initially, so the implication in C3 is true.
5. C1 and C3 are both true, so C4 (C1 holds and C3 holds) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- So the actual sequence is: event2 → event1 → end.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 occurs after event2).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Antecedent C2 is True, and event2 did happen initially, so the implication is True.

Step 4 — combine for C4
- C4 = C1 and C3. Both are True, so C4 is True.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the goal:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context clearly:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will eventually occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, this is true (event1 must happen after event2).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C2 is true, and event2 indeed happened initially, so the implication is true.

Step 4 — combine for C4:
- C4 is ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Step 1 — identify the question:
You ask whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the context and consequences:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Therefore the system produces the infinite alternating sequence event1, event2, event1, event2, ... In particular, event1 does occur (indeed infinitely often).

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A). It holds at every point in time, so C1 is true.
- C2: same formula as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds (immediately and at all times), it certainly holds at some future point — so C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so the disjunction is true.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication: whenever event1 occurs at some time, event1 indeed occurs at that time. So C1 holds.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 also holds.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
- At the initial state event1 happened.
- After event1 (and after event2) no further events can occur — so once event1 has happened, all later states have neither event1 nor event2 occurring.

2. Interpret the conditions:
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — a simple disjunction about the current state.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — this is the implication event1 -> (event1 or event2). This is a propositional tautology: p -> (p ∨ q) is always true whenever evaluated in a state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 holds in every state along the timeline. Since C2 is a tautology at each state, C3 is true globally.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — we must check whether, at the successor of the initial state, C3 is true.

3. Evaluate at the next state:
- After the initial event1 there are no further events, so in the next state neither event1 nor event2 occurs.
- In that next state, C2 (event1 -> (event1 ∨ event2)) is still true: the antecedent is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
- Moreover, from that next state onward no events ever occur, so at every future state C2 remains true. Hence ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is true when evaluated from the next state.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 says: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the facts
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial state event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal — there is no later state reachable after the initial state.
- Also ""after event2 no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur (event1 already occurred and stops further events).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event1 or event2. True in the initial state because event1 happened.
- C2: if event1 then C1. This is a logical tautology (event1 -> (event1 or event2)), so it holds in any state where it is evaluated.
- C3: C2 always holds. Since C2 is a tautology, C3 is true (C2 holds at every state).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state. This requires a next state to exist and C3 to be true there.

Step 4 — key point about the next state
Because event1 happened initially and that prevents any further events, there is no next state. In standard temporal semantics the ""next"" operator is not satisfied when no next state exists. Therefore ""C3 holds in the next state"" is not true.

Final answer
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and “after event1 no other events can happen.” That means the initial state has no successor (there is no next state).

- Check the conditions:
  - C1 (event1 or event2): True, because event1 happened initially.
  - C2 (if event1 then C1): True (if event1 holds then event1 or event2 holds).
  - C3 (C2 always holds): True (C2 holds in every state that exists; here there is only the initial state).
  - C4 (C3 holds in the next state): This requires a next state in which C3 holds. But there is no next state (no events can happen after event1), so the ""next"" condition is not satisfied. Under the usual temporal semantics where Xφ (next φ) is false at a state with no successor, C4 is False.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event1 does not eventually happen).
- C3: Event1 eventually happens (same as C1).
- C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds (i.e., if event1 does not happen then event1 does happen).

Step 3 — reason about event sequences
- From the context: event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does eventually happen.
- So C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true.
- Hence C2 (C1 does not hold) is false.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is the implication (C2 → C3). Since C2 is false, the implication is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- Also, because in fact event1 happens, there is no scenario in the given context where C2 holds, so the implication holds vacuously.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C4 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → ""Event1 does not eventually happen.""
- C3: same as C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 3 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does eventually happen. So C1 is true.
- Hence C2 (the negation of C1) is false.
- C3 is true (same as C1).

Step 4 — evaluate the implication:
An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Since C2 is false and C3 is true, ""If C2 then C3"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C4 is the claim ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds.""

Step 2 — evaluate each condition using the context
- Context: event2 happened initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen.
- From that, event1 eventually happens. So C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is also true.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is true, C2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 (""If C2 then C3"")
- In classical logic an implication is true if its consequent is true (or if its antecedent is false). Here the consequent C3 is true (and the antecedent C2 is false), so the implication holds.

Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Understand the context
- Initially event2 happened (time 0).
- After any event1, the next state must have event2.
- After any event2, the next state must have event1.
- So the system forces alternation: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (holds at a state where event2 happened, e.g. the initial state)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ ""in the next state, event1 does not happen.""
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" ≡ ""if event1 happens now, then in the next state event1 does not happen.""

Reasoning through events
- From the context: whenever event1 happens, the next state must have event2, so the next state does not have event1. Thus C3 is true (it follows directly from the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"").
- Since C3 is true, the disjunction C3 or event1 (which is C4) is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens now.

True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 happens, event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the given rule ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This is the same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C1 → C2 is true.
- C4: C3 eventually holds. C3 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually).

Step 3 — conclusion:
C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C3 becomes true at some time (including immediately).

Step 2 — examine each condition using the context
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches ""after event2, event1 must happen"" — so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement and both true, C1 → C2 is true (in fact C1 → C1 is a tautology). So C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds (from the start), so it certainly holds at some time (immediately), hence ""eventually"" is satisfied.

Step 3 — conclusion
C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. Rule A: after event2, event1 must happen. Rule B: after event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches Rule A, so C1 is true.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement and C1 does hold, C3 is true (the implication is satisfied).

Step 3 — trace event sequence and temporal claim
- Event2 occurred initially; by Rule A (and thus by C1/C2) event1 must occur later. When event1 occurs, no further events can occur (Rule B). That sequence is consistent.
- C3 is already true now. ""Eventually C3 holds"" means C3 holds at some time now or in the future; since it holds now, the eventuality is satisfied.

Conclusion
- C4 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must determine whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen (after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the sequence is event2 then event1, and it ends).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given the context both happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" Event1 happens (True) and C3 holds (True), so the disjunction is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
We must determine whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — translate the conditions:
- Context: Event2 happened initially. After Event2, Event1 must happen. After Event1, no other events can happen. So Event2 and then Event1 both occur.
- C1: Event2 happens or Event1 happens. (C1 = Event2 ∨ Event1)
- C2: C1 does not hold. (C2 = ¬C1)
- C3: C2 does not hold. (C3 = ¬C2)
- C4: Event1 happens or C3 holds. (C4 = Event1 ∨ C3)

Step 3 — evaluate step by step:
- From the context, Event2 happened, so C1 (Event2 ∨ Event1) is True.
- Therefore C2 = ¬C1 is False.
- Hence C3 = ¬C2 is True.
- Finally C4 = Event1 ∨ C3. Since C3 is True, C4 is True (no need to check Event1).

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — use the context to settle which events happen
- Initially, event2 happened → Event2 is True.
- After event2, event1 must happen → Event1 is True.
- (After event1 no other events can happen is consistent and doesn’t prevent event1.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 = (Event2) or (Event1). Since Event2 is True, C1 = True.
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1. Since C1 is True, C2 = False.
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2. Since C2 is False, C3 = True.
- C4 = (Event1) or (C3). Event1 is True and C3 is True, so C4 = True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After every event1, event2 must happen. After every event2, event1 must happen. So the system must alternate event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (event2 must occur at least once and in fact will recur).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — this asserts event2 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — there is a time after which C1 is true (i.e., from some point onward event2 never occurs).
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold.

Step 3 — reason about possible executions
- From the context, since event1 has happened initially, the requirement ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces an occurrence of event2. So C1 (""event2 never occurs"") is false.
- Because the obligations alternate, event2 must reoccur after each event1, so event2 cannot stop happening forever — there is no time after which event2 never happens. Thus C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false.
- Therefore C3 is false (same as C1), and C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The context says event1 happened initially and that after event1, event2 must happen (and after event2, event1 must happen). Thus event2 is required to occur following the initial event1.
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") asserts that at some time C1 becomes true; since C1 is false (event2 must occur), C2 is false.
- C3 is the same as C1 and is false.
- C4 is C2 AND C3; since both conjuncts are false, C4 is false.
---
Identify what the hypothesis asks
- The hypothesis C4 asserts that (C2 holds) and (C3 holds). C3 is the same as C1. So C4 says: ""C1 eventually holds, and C1 holds now"" where C1 = ""Event2 does not happen.""

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — interpreted as a claim that event2 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some future point (or from some point onward) it becomes true that event2 does not happen.
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 AND C3, i.e. both C1 is currently true and C1 will eventually hold.

Trace the events given the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- The context requires: after event1, event2 must happen. Since event1 has already happened, event2 must (and therefore will) happen at some later time.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen again, and so on — the system forces event2 to occur after the initial event1.

Determine if the hypothesis can be satisfied
- Because event2 must occur (it cannot be that event2 never happens), C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.
- If C1 is false, C3 is false, and C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") cannot be true either (you cannot eventually make a false claim that event2 never happens true, given event2 must occur).
- Therefore C4 = C2 AND C3 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the question: C4 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the context: initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, event2 must happen."" So in the next state event2 happens, not event1. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true (the disjunction is true regardless of event2).

Now C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" C3 is already true (from C2), so the implication holds. Even without relying on C2, the implication is trivially valid because (event2) -> (C2 or event2) is logically a tautology (p -> (q or p) is always true).

Final answer: True
---
Goal: decide whether C4 (""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"") is True or False.

Assumptions: ""After X"" means in the next state. (This fits the use of ""next state"" in C1.)

Step-by-step:
1. Context: initially event1 happened.
2. From ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we get that in the next state following the initial state event2 occurs. Therefore event1 does NOT happen in the next state. So C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
3. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.
4. C3 is ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" — C2 is true, so C3 is true (the disjunction is true regardless of event2).
5. C4 is ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" — since C3 is already true, the implication is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

Conclusion: C4 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 is the statement: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event1 does NOT happen in the next state).
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens (C3 = C2 ∨ event2).
- C4: If event2 happens, then C3 holds (event2 → C3).

Step 3 — logical reasoning
C3 is the disjunction (C2 ∨ event2). Whenever event2 is true, the disjunction C2 ∨ event2 is true (a ∨ b is true when b is true). Thus whenever event2 happens the consequent of C4 is true, so the implication event2 → C3 is true in that case. If event2 does not happen, the implication is also true (false antecedent → anything is true). Therefore C4 is true in all cases; it is a tautologically true implication given C3’s definition.

Sample responses:
Identify what is being asked
- We evaluate whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context and the other conditions, starting from the initial state.

Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p); it is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it indeed holds in every state, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Because C2 is true, the disjunction is true in every state (regardless of whether event1 happens).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must check C3 in the state immediately after the initial state.

Trace the event sequence from the context
- Initially (state 0) event2 happened.
- The context requires that after event2, event1 must happen → in the next state (state 1) event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so state 1 is terminal (no further events), but that does not affect truth of C3 at state 1.

Determine C4
- At state 1 (the ""next state""), C2 holds (it holds in all states), so C3 holds there.
- Therefore C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true when evaluated in the initial state.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 holds in any state where it is evaluated.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology at every state, the claim that C1 always holds is true.

3. C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Because C2 is true (it holds always), the disjunction is true in every state regardless of whether event1 happens.

4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is true in every state (from step 3), it in particular holds in the next state.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 says: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We evaluate this starting from the initial state (where event2 happened).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, ""always C1"" is true. So C2 is true (in every state).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Because C2 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens. Thus C3 is true in every state.

Step 3 — conclude about C4
C3 is true in every state, so in particular it holds in the next state. Therefore C4 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim: C4 is the implication C2 -> C3.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions given the context:
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""Event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true (it already occurred).
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", so C2 is false.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 = (C2 -> C3): that is false->true, which is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: event1 happened initially, and events alternate forever (after event1 comes event2, after event2 comes event1). So event1 does occur (initially and repeatedly).
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1) so C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 (""If C2 then C3"")
- C4 is the implication (C2 → C3). Here the antecedent C2 is false, and the consequent C3 is true. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Also, since C3 is actually true, the implication is true regardless.
- Note also logically (¬C1 → C1) is equivalent to C1, and we already have C1 true.

Final answer:
True

- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" — a conditional with a false antecedent (C2) and true consequent (C3).

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
An implication with a false antecedent is (vacuously) true. Here C2 is false and C3 is true, so C4 is true.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened and the context says “after event2, no other events can happen.” Therefore no event (including event1) can ever occur after the initial state. So event1 never happens.
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false (there is no future state where C1 becomes true).
- C3 (""if C2 holds, then event1 happens"") is an implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false), so C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"". Since C3 is true, the disjunction is true.

Thus C4 is True.
---
Goal: decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no future occurrence of event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (not needed further because event2 already happened initially).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given that after event2 no events can occur, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is never true (no future event1), C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false), so the implication is true (vacuously). Thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true (as just shown), so the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 happens.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So the state where event2 occurred is terminal: there is no next state with any events.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- C1: ""event1 does not happen"" — this is true in the initial (terminal) state because event2 happened and no event1 occurs there.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1) — this requires a next state. But there is no next state (terminal), so C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2) — this is true iff C2 holds at some present or future state. Since C2 is false now and there are no future states, C2 never holds, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3) — similarly, C3 never holds now or later, so C4 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — meanings
- C1: ""event1 does not happen"" (holds in a state iff event1 does not occur in that state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So from the initial state onward, event1 never occurs in any state.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 is true in the initial state (event1 does not happen) and in every future state (event1 never happens).
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is true in the initial state (the next state also has no event1).
- Since C2 already holds now, C3 (""eventually C2"") is true.
- Since C3 already holds now, C4 (""eventually C3"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, event1 can never occur at any later point).
- Also: if event1 happens then event2 must happen afterwards — this is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs (see next).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context (event2 already happened and after event2 no other events can happen), event1 never happens. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state also has no event1 (no events can happen after event2), so C1 is true in the next state. Thus C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds right now (and therefore holds at some future time), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 holds now, it certainly holds at some future time, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, event1 never occurs at any later point.
- Also “after event1, event2 must happen” is given, but since event1 never actually occurs (because event2 already occurred and blocks further events), that requirement is never triggered.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 never happens in any reachable state, this implication is vacuously true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 is true in every state, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 holds in every state, so in particular it holds in the next state of any state; hence C3 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true in every state, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 (""if event1 happens then event2 happens"") matches the given rule ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 holds.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true in the system: since the only reachable state is one where event2 has already happened and no further events can occur, there is never a state where event1 occurs and the implication would be violated — so C1 holds at every reachable state.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") requires there to be a next state where C2 is true. But by the context, after the initial state (where event2 already happened) no other events and thus no next state exist. Under the usual temporal semantics (Xφ is false at a state with no successor), C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") therefore is false because C3 does not hold at the initial state.

Hence C4 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.
- From the context: event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 can never occur in any reachable state.
- C1 (""if event1 happens then event2 happens"") is therefore true in every state (vacuously, because event1 never occurs).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true because C1 holds in all states.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true for the same reason in the next state (the next state still has event2 and no further events).
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true because C3 holds in every state.
- Hence C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e., there exists some future state at which C3 is true.

Step 2 — interpret conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: same as C1 (identical).
- C3: C1 or C2 — so C3 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens in the next state.""

Step 3 — use the context to build the timeline
- Initially (time 0): event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → time 1: event1.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → time 2: event2.
- This alternation continues: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C3 at future times
- At t0: C3 is ""event2 at t1"" — false (t1 has event1).
- At t1: C3 is ""event2 at t2"" — true (t2 has event2).
- So C3 holds at t1.

Step 5 — evaluate C4
- Since there exists a future time (t1) where C3 holds, ""C3 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: determine whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

1. Restate:
- Context yields an infinite alternation starting from the initial state: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, state2 = event2, state3 = event1, ...
- C1 and C2: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (evaluated at the current state).
- C3: C1 or C2, so C3 ≡ ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C4: eventually C3 holds, i.e. there exists some future state at which the next state has event2.

2. Evaluate:
- At the initial state (state0) the next state (state1) has event1, so C1 and C2 are false at state0 and C3 is false at state0.
- At state1, the next state (state2) has event2, so C3 is true at state1.

3. Conclusion:
Since C3 holds at state1, C3 holds at some future state; therefore C4 is true.

Answer: True
---
Identify the hypothesis
- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point, C3 is true).
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"".
- C1 and C2 both state ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (they are identical).

Examine the conditions and trace the sequence
- Initially event2 has happened (state0).
- Given ""after event2, event1 must happen"", state1 must have event1.
- Given ""after event1, event2 must happen"", state2 must have event2.
- Thus events alternate: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, …

Evaluate C1/C2/C3 over time
- At the initial state (state0), C1/C2 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false because the next state (state1) has event1.
- At state1, the next state (state2) has event2, so C1/C2 are true at state1. Therefore C3 (their disjunction) is true at state1.

Conclusion about C4
- Since C3 is true at state1, C3 eventually holds (from the initial state).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Start state (s0): event2 holds (given).
2. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means there is no successor state with any event (in particular no successor where event1 happens).
3. C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false in s0 because there is no next state with event1.
4. C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true in s0 (since C1 is false).
5. C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") requires a next state where C2 is true. But there is no next state after s0, so C3 is false in s0.
6. C4 (""C3 always holds"") would require C3 to hold in s0 (and every state). Since C3 is false in s0, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- Let t0 be the initial state. At t0, event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means that from t1 onward no events ever occur. In particular, event1 never occurs at any future time.
- C1 (event1 happens in the next state) evaluated at t0 is false, because event1 does not happen at t1.
- C2 (C1 does not hold) at t0 is true.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) at t0 says that at t1, C1 does not hold — equivalently, event1 does not happen at t2. Since no events occur after t0, that is true.
- C4 (C3 always holds) requires that at every state, C3 is true. Because event1 never occurs at any future time, C3 is true at every state; thus C4 is true.
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event2 happened (state 0: event2 true).
   - After event2, no other events can happen. So from state1 onward, no events (in particular event1 never occurs at any future state).
   - The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

2. Translate the conditions (reading them relative to each state):
   - C1: X(event1) — event1 happens in the next state.
   - C2: ¬C1 — X(event1) does not hold (i.e. event1 does not happen in the next state).
   - C3: X(C2) — in the next state, C2 holds (the next state asserts that event1 will not happen in its next state).
   - C4: G(C3) — C3 holds at all states (always).

3. Evaluate given the context:
   - Because after the initial event2 no other events can happen, event1 never occurs at any future state. So X(event1) is false at every state.
   - Therefore C2 (¬X(event1)) is true at every state.
   - Consequently C3 = X(C2) is true at every state (the next state does indeed satisfy C2).
   - Hence C4 = G(C3) is true: C3 holds in all states.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the target:
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate components using the context:
- Context gives: event1 happened initially. So ""Event1 happens"" is true.
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is true (equivalently: event1 happens).
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is true.
- C3 = C1 and C2 — both true, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 = ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"". Both parts are true, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — check for contradictions with context:
- The context requires event2 after event1 and forbids events after event2, but that doesn't contradict C4 (C4 does not deny event2). Therefore no inconsistency arises.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Interpret each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — logically equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1, so also equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — since C1 and C2 each reduce to ""Event1 happens"", C3 reduces to ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" — this reduces to ""Event1 happens"" (and again ""Event1 happens"").

Step 3 — Use the context
- Context states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 happens is true.
- The other context sentences (that after event1 event2 must happen, and that after event2 nothing else can happen) do not negate event1; they only force event2 later and make the sequence terminal after event2.

Conclusion
- C4 reduces to ""Event1 happens"", which is true according to the context.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
The hypothesis is asking whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur later).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing occurs after event2).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" The context says event1 happened initially, so C1 is true.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 happens (given) and C3 holds (just established), so C4 is true.

Step 4 — check consistency with the context
The required occurrence of event2 after event1 and the ban on events after event2 do not contradict any of C1–C4, because all statements only assert that event1 happened (possibly redundantly). Those are satisfied by the initial event1.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: initially event2 has happened, and both event1 and event2 are terminal (after either one, no other events can occur). So the trace has event2 at the initial state and then stops—there is no next state.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because it happens in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" False, because there is no next state; in standard temporal semantics Xφ is false at the final state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False, since C2 is false now and there are no future states to make it true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C3 is false, and event1 never happens), so C4 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the formula ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the current (initial) state event2 is true.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so the state where event2 holds has no successor (no next state). (Also after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 does not hold initially.)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since event2 already holds initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (because event2 is terminal), so C2 is false (the next-state formula cannot be satisfied).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false now and there are no future states to make it true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is false, and event1 never happens (cannot happen after event2 and it did not happen initially), so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Start state (initial): event2 has happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen, so there are no further event occurrences.
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens""): True in the initial state (it already happened).
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): False. There is no next state with a future occurrence of event2 (after event2 no events occur), so C1 does not hold in the next state.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): False, because C2 is false now and will never become true (no future states where it could hold).
- C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens""): Both disjuncts are false (C3 is false and event1 never happens), so C4 is false."

- C1: Event2 happens or event1 happens.
- C2: C1 eventually holds.
- C3: Event2 happens or event1 happens. (same as C1)
- C4: C2 holds and C3 holds.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 occurs and is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal, but it did not occur).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1 is true because event2 did happen (so ""event2 or event1"" holds).
- C2 is true because C1 already holds at the initial time, so it holds eventually.
- C3 is the same as C1, so it is true.
- C4 is the conjunction of C2 and C3, both true, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, so ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" (C1 and C3) is already true.
- ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is also true because C1 holds at the initial time (so it holds at some time).
- Therefore C4 = (C2 and C3) is true.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 is the conjunction (C2 holds) AND (C3 holds). We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds.""
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 and C3.

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen (at the initial time).
- After event2, no other events can happen — so no further events (in particular, event1 does not occur later).

Step 4 — evaluate the Cs
- C1 is true because event2 did happen.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds at the initial time (standard “eventually” semantics include the current moment).

Step 5 — conclusion
C2 is true and C3 is true, so C4 (C2 ∧ C3) is True.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p); it is true in every state regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds in every state already, C1 certainly holds at some future time (immediately), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is true, so the disjunction is true; therefore C3 holds now.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 already holds (now), it certainly holds at some future time (immediately), so C4 is true.

Step 3 — note on the event sequence
- The given alternation (event2 → event1 → event2 → …) does not affect the above, because C1 is a tautology independent of the actual event occurrences.

Final answer:
True
---
Identify hypothesis: C4 is the claim ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide if C4 is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P). It is true at every point in time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds right now (it is always true), C1 certainly holds at some future time — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 already holds, so this disjunction is true now.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 holds now, it also holds at some future time — so C4 is true.

Trace of events (context): The context gives an infinite alternation (event2, event1, event2, ...), but that detail is not needed because C1 is already a tautology making C2–C4 true regardless.

Conclusion: True
---
Goal: determine whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide if C4 is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A). It is true whenever evaluated, so C1 holds now and at all times.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds immediately (indeed always), there certainly exists a future time at which C1 holds. Thus C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is true, so the disjunction is true now. Therefore C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 already holds now, it certainly holds at some (indeed the current) time in the future; hence C4 is true.

(Aside: the context—event2 occurs initially and the two events alternate—also ensures repeated occurrences of event1 and event2, but that is not needed once C1 is seen to be a tautology.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked:
- Decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will happen after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 already happened and event1 will happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is logically true because C1 contains event1 as a disjunct; whenever event1 happens, C1 is true (and the implication is vacuously true when event1 doesn't happen).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a logical truth (holds at any time), C2 holds at every time; thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 always holds (true now and at all times), then certainly C3 holds at some time in the future (i.e., eventually).

Conclusion:
- C4 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initially event2 happened, so the proposition C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") is already true (because event2 happened).

2. C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is trivially true whenever event1 happens, because if event1 happens then the disjunction in C1 is satisfied by event1. So C2 holds.

3. C3 is ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a logical implication that is true whenever event1 happens (and otherwise trivially true), C2 holds at every time point, so C3 holds.

4. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" If a property holds always, it certainly holds at some time (including the present), so C3 holding always implies C3 holds eventually.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 says ""C3 eventually holds"", i.e. ""eventually, C2 always holds"". We must decide whether this is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — translate the scenario into a timeline
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal.
So the only possible sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 (later) → nothing.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" In the actual run both happen (event2 initially and event1 later), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Evaluate at any time:
  - Before event1, the antecedent ""event1 happens"" is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
  - At or after event1, the antecedent is true, and the consequent C1 is true (since event1 did occur, and event2 did occur too), so the implication is true.
  Thus C2 holds at every point in the run.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 holds at every point, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 already holds at all times, then certainly C3 holds at some (indeed every) future time — so C4 is true.

Sample responses:
First: the hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Examine each condition on the given timeline (states 0,1,2,... with events: state0 event2, state1 event1, state2 event2, state3 event1, ... — events alternate forever).

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (A → A). It is true in every state: when event2 happens it implies itself; when event2 does not happen the implication is vacuously true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C1 is true in the next state of any current state, so C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds in every state, C2 certainly holds at some future state (indeed immediately), so C3 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true in every state, C3 indeed always holds, so C4 is true.

Therefore the final answer is:
True
---
First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the propositional tautology p → p (with p = ""event2""). A tautology; it holds in every state regardless of whether event2 actually occurs there.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C1 is true in the next state as well. Thus C2 is true at every state that has a next state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is true in every state (and in particular in the immediate next state), there is always some future state where C2 holds. So C3 is true at every state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true at every state, C4 holds.

About the timeline: starting with event2 and alternating guarantees an infinite sequence of states (each state has a next), so ""next"" and ""eventually"" are always meaningful here.

Conclusion: C4 is True.
---
We are asked whether C4 is True or False.

Interpretation and stepwise reasoning
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (A -> A). It is true in any state regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, it is true in the next state as well. So C2 is true in the current state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is already true in the current state (indeed in every state), ""eventually C2"" is immediately satisfied. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true in every state (it holds now and in all states), so G C3 is true.

The given dynamics (initial event2, alternating event1/event2) are consistent with the conditions but are not needed to make C1–C4 true because C1 is a tautology.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
The question asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the chain C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand the context (constraints on events)
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 nothing else can happen, event1 never occurs in any future (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and no earlier occurrence is given). But the truth of the C-clauses below does not depend on whether event1 actually happens in the world because some of them are logical/tautological statements.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A). It is true in all models, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 does hold, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is true — therefore C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds (now), so it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually). Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions C1–C3.

Step 2 — interpret the context briefly
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
From this, event1 cannot occur at any time (event2 already happened initially and after event2 nothing can happen). This fact does not change the logical evaluation below.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs. So C1 holds (is true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is already true (and nothing in the context forces it to become false later). Therefore C3 does hold (indeed it holds now), so ""eventually C3 holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the statements and the event-context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 is true in all states.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 3 — relate C3 to C4
- C4 says C3 eventually holds. C3 is already true (at the initial state), so it holds now and therefore ""eventually"" (which includes the present) is satisfied.

Step 4 — consider the event context
- The event constraints (event2 initially, no events after event2, and the rule about event1 implying event2) do not change the truth-values of these purely logical statements; C3 is true immediately.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened (and it has initially), no further events can occur, so event2 cannot occur in any possible execution.
- (The fact ""after event2 no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Because event2 never happens in any execution, this implication is vacuously true. So C1 holds.
- C2 is the same formula as C1, so C2 also holds.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 holds and C2 holds, C3 is true. (More generally C3 is logically trivial here because it is ""if A then A"" when C1 and C2 are identical.)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true (and in fact is a trivial implication), so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False, given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. From this, event2 never actually occurs in the run (because event1 already occurred and stops further events).
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (C2 is syntactically the same as C1.)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. This is an implication between C1 and C2.

Step 3 — reason about truth of C1–C3
- Because event2 never happens in the run, the conditional ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is vacuously true, so C1 and C2 both hold in the given context.
- Independently of the context, C1 and C2 are the same formula; thus C3 (C1 → C2) is a logical tautology (P → P), so it is true in every model.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C3 is always true (tautologically true), so the statement C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- C4 asserts: ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event2 can never occur after the initial event1).
- Also ""After event2, no other events can happen"" but that is irrelevant because event2 never actually occurs here.

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds.
- C4: C3 always holds.

Step 4 — Reasoning about truth values
- Because event1 happened initially and no further events can happen, event2 never occurs in any reachable state. Thus the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is never true, so both C1 and C2 are vacuously true.
- Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication ""If C1 holds then C2 holds"" (C3) is true.
- That truth does not change over time or along any reachable timeline (there are no future states where these could flip), so C3 holds in all states — i.e., C3 always holds.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial time).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from any occurrence of event1 there will be a later event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from any occurrence of event2 there will be a later event1).

We are asked whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Context: initially event1; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. Starting from the initial event1, the rules force an alternation event1 → event2 → event1 …, so both events occur infinitely often and event2 will occur eventually.

Evaluate the claims:
- C1: event2 eventually happens — true (follows from initial event1 and ""after event1, event2 must happen"").
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens — true (C1 is true and event1 happened initially).
- C3: C2 eventually holds — true (C2 holds now, and the alternation ensures it will hold again).
- C4: event1 happens or C3 holds — true (event1 happens initially, so the disjunction is satisfied).

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true under the given initial condition and rules.

Step 2 — restate the rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 is followed by an occurrence of event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1).

These rules force an alternating sequence starting from the initial event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because starting from the initial event1 the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees an event2 later.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" True: C1 holds (just shown) and event1 already happened initially.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True: C2 already holds now, so it certainly holds eventually.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" True: event1 did happen initially (and C3 also holds), so the disjunction is true.

Sample responses:
First identify what’s being asked: C4 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. (So event2 does happen.)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Whether C3 is true or false doesn’t matter for the conditional once we know C1’s truth value.

Evaluate C4: An implication ""If C1 then C3"" is true whenever the antecedent (C1) is false. Since C1 is false in the given context, C4 is true (vacuously).

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Context forces event2 to have happened initially, and after event2 no events can happen. So in every allowed scenario event2 has occurred.
- C1 and C2 assert ""event2 does not happen"" — both are false in all scenarios consistent with the context.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is also false, because C2 never becomes true.
- C4 is the implication ""if C1 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true; since C1 cannot hold in any scenario allowed by the context, there is no counterexample to the implication.
- Therefore C4 is True.

- C4 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" We must determine whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 did occur (at the start), and nothing can happen afterwards.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false now and cannot become true later (event2 already happened), C3 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 (""If C1 then C3"")
- In standard logic, an implication ""If A then B"" is true whenever A is false. Here C1 is false, so the implication is true (vacuous truth).
- (As a secondary note: in temporal logic where ""eventually"" includes the current moment, ""if C1 holds now then C3 holds"" would also be true, but that is not needed.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" is equivalent to ""event2"".
- C2: ""C1 or event2"" therefore is equivalent to ""event2"".
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" is ""event2 holds in the next state"".
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" is ""event2 holds in the next state, or event1 happens"".

Step 4 — reason about truth values
- Initially event2 holds, so C1 and C2 are true in the initial state.
- The context says that after event2 no other events can happen. That means there are no future occurrences of other events (in particular event1 cannot occur after event2), and the fact that event2 has occurred persists so C2 (i.e. event2) holds in the next state as well. Hence C3 is true.
- Since C3 is true, C4 = (C3 or event1) is true regardless of event1.

Final answer:
True

Goal: decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 holds now).
- After event2, no other events can happen (no events occur in any future state after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant because event1 does not occur given the second point).

2. Simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" simplifies to event2.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" is Next(event2) — event2 must hold in the next state.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" is Next(event2) or event1.

3. Evaluate under the context
- We know event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore in the next state no events occur, so event2 does not hold in the next state (Next(event2) is false) and event1 does not occur either.
- Both disjuncts of C4 are false, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C4 is true in the given scenario.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this just says event2 happens (redundant).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 already says event2, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this asks whether event2 holds in the next state.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — so C4 is true iff either event2 holds in the next state, or event1 holds now.

Step 3 — apply the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → in the next state there are no events, so event2 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C3 is false.
- Event1 does not hold in the initial state (we were only told event2 initially happened). Could event1 hold at some time? If event1 had happened before, event2 would have to happen after it; but the given initial situation is just that event2 happened and after event2 no further events occur, so there is no evidence that event1 happened. There is no way for event1 to hold now or later given the constraints.

Step 4 — conclusion
C3 is false and event1 is false, so C4 (C3 or event1) is false.

Final answer:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C4 (C1 holds and C3 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs (which it already did), no further events (including event2) can occur.
- The rule “After event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (event1 already happened and forbids any later events).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” True (it already happened initially).
- C2: “Event1 eventually happens.” Same as C1, so True.
- C3: “C2 holds and event1 happens.” C2 is True and event1 does happen, so C3 is True.
- C4: “C1 holds and C3 holds.” Both C1 and C3 are True, so C4 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C4 (""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition with the context
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has already occurred at the initial moment.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Because event1 has already happened, ""event1 eventually happens"" is true.
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, also true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 has happened, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — check C4
- C4 is ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

No part of the context contradicts these: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only forbids later events but does not invalidate that event1 already happened.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the context and what each claim says
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 has already occurred.)
  - After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then later event1 must occur.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, no further events occur.)
- Claims:
  - C1: Event1 eventually happens.
  - C2: Event1 eventually happens. (same as C1)
  - C3: C2 holds and event1 happens. (i.e. event1 eventually happens AND event1 happens)
  - C4: C1 holds and C3 holds. (conjunction of C1 and C3)

Step 3 — evaluate the claims using the context
- Since event1 has already happened initially, the statement ""event1 eventually happens"" is true (it has occurred at or before the current point). Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.
- ""Event1 happens"" (the plain fact that event1 occurred) is true because of the initial event.
- C3 requires C2 and ""event1 happens""; both are true, so C3 is true.
- C4 requires C1 and C3; both are true, so C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, so ""event2 happens"" is true in the initial state.
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"", so C1 is true initially.
- C2 is ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"". Since C1 is equivalent to event2, C2 is a tautology (event2 → event2) and therefore holds in the initial state.
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". Because C2 already holds now, C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"". But the context says that after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state. Under standard temporal semantics, a next-state formula (X φ) is false when no successor state exists. Therefore C4 is false.
---
First: the question asks whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 occurred, and after event2 no further events ever occur. (So event2 is true at the initial state and false at all later states.)

- C1: ""event2 and event2"" is just event2 (true at the initial state).

- C2: ""if event2 then C1"". At any state where event2 is true, C1 is true (they are the same), so the implication holds there. At states where event2 is false the implication is vacuously true. So C2 holds at the initial state and at every later state.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is true (eventually includes the current state).

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We need C3 to be true at the immediate successor state. But C2 holds at every later state (vacuously when event2 is false), so from the next state C2 already holds, hence ""eventually C2"" holds at that next state. Therefore C3 is true at the next state, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""event2 and event2"", which is equivalent to ""event2"" (so C1 holds exactly when event2 holds).

2. C2 is ""if event2 then C1"". Since C1 ≡ event2, C2 is the implication event2 → event2, which is a tautology (it holds in any state).

3. C3 is ""eventually C2"". Because C2 is true right now (a tautology), ""eventually C2"" is true in the current state.

4. C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). But the context says that initially event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen — there is no next state. Under the usual semantics of the next operator, X φ is false at a state with no successor. Therefore C4 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened. The context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" so once event1 has happened the system has no successor state and event2 never occurs.
- C1 requires event2 to happen, so C1 is false.
- C2 is C1 and event1; since C1 is false, C2 is false (event1 itself is true but doesn't rescue C2).
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold,"" so C3 is true.
- C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can follow event1), so C3 cannot hold in a next state — C4 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened.
- The context says: after event1, no other events can happen. So there are no future events (no successor state with events); in particular event2 does not occur later.
- C1 (event2 happens) is false. 
- C2 (C1 and event1) is false (C1 false, even though event1 is true).
- C3 (C2 does not hold) is true in the initial state.
- C4 asserts ""C3 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state after event1 (no further events), so the ""next"" claim is not satisfied. Under standard next-state semantics (a next state must exist), C4 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → there are no successor states after the initial state.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this requires event2 to occur. Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event1 did happen).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — C2 is false, so C3 is true in the current (initial) state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — there is no next state (no events/transition after event1), so C3 cannot hold in a next state. Therefore C4 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" The context only guarantees that event1 happened initially (once). It does not imply event1 holds at all times or in every state, so C1 is false.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.
- C1 says “Event1 always happens.” The context only guarantees that event1 happened initially — it does not guarantee event1 at every time. So C1 is false.
- C2 is “C1 holds and event2 happens.” Even though event2 must happen (because event1 happened), C2 requires C1 as well, so C2 is false.
- C3 is “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 is false and C1 cannot become true later, C2 will never hold, so C3 is false.
- Therefore C4 (“C3 does not hold”) is true.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 is the claim ""C3 does not hold."" We must determine whether C4 is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened. So event1 has occurred.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Since event1 did occur, event2 will occur (at some later point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the run ends at or immediately after event2).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as “event1 occurs in the run” — it holds because event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 holds and, by the context, event2 must happen after event1, so C2 holds (once event2 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since event2 is required after event1, C2 will hold at the time event2 occurs, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Because C3 is true, C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must determine whether C4 (C2 holds and C3 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P), so it holds in any state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must evaluate C1 in the state immediately following the initial state.
- C3: same as C1, so it holds in the initial state.
- C4: true iff both C2 and C3 are true.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate
- Initially event1 happened (call that state S0).
- After event1 no other events can happen: the next state (if present) has no events occurring. In that next state S1, event1 does not occur, so the implication ""if event1 happens then event1 happens"" is vacuously true there. Thus C1 holds in S1, so C2 is true.
- C3 is true in the initial state S0 because C1 is tautologically true there as well.
- Therefore both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" is a logical tautology (A → A). So C1 holds in any state where it is evaluated.
- C3 is the same formula as C1, so C3 also holds in any state.
- The context says: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So in the next state after the initial one, event1 does not occur (no events occur).
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state. In that next state event1 is false, so the implication event1 → event1 is still true there (false → false is true). Therefore C2 holds.
- Since both C2 and C3 hold, their conjunction C4 holds.

Thus C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and C3 holds"". We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is True in any state where it is evaluated.
- C3: identical to C1, so C3 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asserts there is a next state and that C1 is true there.

Step 3 — trace the event sequences given the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- The context also says: after event1, no other events can happen. That means there is no subsequent state after the initial state in which any events occur; in particular, there is no next state where properties are evaluated.
- In standard temporal/logical semantics, a ""next"" claim about a nonexistent next state is not satisfied (X φ is false at a terminal state with no successor). Thus C2 is false because there is no next state in which C1 could hold.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C3 is True, C2 is False, so the conjunction C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is False.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Interpretation: the run starts in a state where event1 has already occurred, and because ""after event1 no other events can happen"" there are no further events in the future (in particular event2 will never occur).

Now examine the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (a conjunct repeated). Since event2 never happens (no further events after the initial event1), C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false now, it is not true that C1 holds at all times, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true (¬false = true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds in the initial state, so it certainly holds at some time in the future (immediately). Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context about events.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Thus once event1 has happened, nothing else can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 will not occur after event1.)

Given ""initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", the actual observable sequence is: event1 happened and then nothing else. In particular, event2 never happens at any time.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Since event2 never happens, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false and never holds, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, C3 is true (it already holds initially).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is already true immediately, it certainly eventually holds.

Conclusion
C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — Understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant since event2 never occurs given the previous facts.)

Step 2 — Evaluate C1:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- Given that event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen.
- Therefore C1 is false.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2 and C3:
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C4:
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"". C3 already holds (it is true now), so C4 holds.

Goal: decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False.

Reasoning step by step

1. Interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no further events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 will later occur).

Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after it, event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no time before the initial state when event1 could have happened).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 never happens).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since event1 does not happen and C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false now and cannot become true later (no further events), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no further events can occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant since event1 never can occur after event2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This would require event1 to hold now (and at all times). But the initial event was event2, and no further events can occur, so event1 does not hold. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is never true (no future events can make it true), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True

You ask whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true. Step‑by‑step:

1. Context constraints:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   - If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.

2. Can event1 ever happen? No — event2 already happened initially, and after event2 no other events can occur, so there is no time at which event1 can occur.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False (event1 cannot happen at all).
   - C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" False (requires event1 and C1; both fail).
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False (C2 never holds).
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (since C3 is false).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 is the statement ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the trace
- Initially (state S0) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → in the next state S1, event2 occurs.
- After event2, no other events can happen → from S2 onward no events occur.

So the concrete trace is: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: (no events), ...

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At S0, the next state S1 has event2 (not event1), so C1 is false at S0.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false at S0, C2 is true at S0.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds at S0, C3 is true at S0 (eventually is satisfied immediately).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must check C3 at S1. At S1, C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" evaluated at S1: C1 at S1 claims ""event1 happens in S2"", but S2 has no events, so that C1 at S1 is false, so C2 is true at S1. Hence C2 holds at S1, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true at S1. Therefore C3 holds in the next state S1, so C4 is true at S0.

Final answer
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Timeline from the context:
  - s0 (initial): event1 happens.
  - s1 (immediately after s0): event2 must happen.
  - s2 and later: no events can happen.

- Evaluate the conditions at s0 (the natural evaluation point unless otherwise stated):
  - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — that asks whether event1 happens in s1. It does not (s1 has event2), so C1 is false at s0.
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — therefore true at s0.
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — since C2 already holds at s0, C3 is true at s0.
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — this asks whether C3 is true at s1. At s1, C1 (which would assert event1 happens in s2) is false because s2 has no events, so C2 is true at s1; hence C3 (C2 eventually holds) is true at s1. Therefore C4 is true.

So C4 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step by step):

- Timeline from the context:
  - s0 (initial): event1 happened.
  - s1 (next): event2 happens (since after event1, event2 must happen).
  - s2 and onward: no events (since after event2 no other events can happen).

- Interpretations of the Ci (all evaluated relative to whatever current state we're considering):
  - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false).
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some state now or in the future C2 is true).
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — so to evaluate C4 at s0 we must check C3 at s1.

- Evaluate at s1:
  - C1 at s1 asks whether event1 happens at s2. At s2 there are no events, so event1 does not happen there ⇒ C1 is false at s1.
  - Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true at s1.
  - Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true at s1 (indeed C2 already holds immediately at s1).

- Therefore C3 holds in the next state (s1) relative to s0, so C4 is true at the initial state.

Thus the answer is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 occurred.
- The rules force alternation: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So events alternate indefinitely: event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the rule after event2, event1 must happen — so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is true and event2 did happen initially — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 is true, so the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is false. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" For C4 to be true, C3 would have to be true at all times. However, C3 is already false (at the initial moment), so it cannot always hold.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and C1–C4
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") is exactly entailed by the context.
- C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens). Since C1 holds by context and event2 happened initially, C2 is true (at the initial point).
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" — this is the negation of C2. Because C2 is true, C3 is false (at the initial point).
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" — for C4 to be true, C3 must be true at all times (in particular at the initial point).

Step 3 — conclusion
- C3 is false (it fails at the initial point), so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False

Examine each condition against the context:
1. Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So event2 → event1 and event1 → event2, with event2 true initially.
2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is True.
3. C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is True and event2 did happen initially, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True

First identify the question: is C4 (the statement ""C3 does not hold"") true or false given the context?

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (Also: after event1 no other events can happen.)
   - Therefore, once event2 has occurred (and it did initially), no other events can occur afterward; in particular, event1 does not occur.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
   - This is false, because event1 does not occur (event2 occurred initially and prevents any further events).

3. C2: ""C1 always holds.""
   - Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds.""
   - Event2 does happen (initially). The antecedent is true, but C2 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C3 does not hold.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold.""
   - From (4) C3 is false, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- C4 asserts “C3 does not hold.” We must decide if C3 is false given the context; if so C4 is True, otherwise False.

Step 2 — parse the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterwards.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 does not occur.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Given event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: “If event2 happens, then C2 holds.” Event2 does happen (initially), but C2 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C3 does not hold (C3 is false).

Step 4 — conclusion about C4
- C4 states “C3 does not hold.” We found C3 is false, so C4 is True.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (call that state s0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the state after any state where event1 holds, event2 holds).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate: if event1 holds at some state, event2 holds at the next; if event2 holds, event1 holds at the next).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens (event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. This implication is trivially true whenever C1 is interpreted as (event2 ∧ event1), because C1 already includes event2. So C2 is a tautologically true implication in any state.
- C3: C2 holds in the next state. Since C2 is true in every state, C2 will also be true in the next state; therefore C3 is true in the current state.
- C4: C3 holds or event1 happens (C3 ∨ event1). We have already shown C3 is true; additionally, the context gives that event1 is true in the initial state. Either way, the disjunction is true.

Conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state (time 0): event1 happened.
- “After event1, event2 must happen” and “After event2, event1 must happen” imply the two events alternate in time (e1 at time 0, then e2 at time 1, then e1 at time 2, etc.). They do not need to occur simultaneously.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: “event2 happens and event1 happens” — interpreted as both holding in the same state. Under the alternating behavior this is false at every single state (they do not co-occur).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true in every state (vacuously true).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true (at any state we look, C2 will be true at the next state).
- C4: “C3 holds or event1 happens.” At time 0 event1 is true, so the disjunction is true already; more generally C3 is true everywhere, so the disjunction is always true.

Step 3 — conclusion
C4 is True. 

True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context/rules
- Initially (time t0) event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at t1 event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at t2 event1), and they alternate thereafter.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""event2 and event1"" — this requires both to hold simultaneously. Given the alternation, there is no state where both hold together, so C1 is false at every state.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C2 is true at every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — since C2 is true everywhere (including the next state), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — C3 is already true, so the disjunction is true (regardless of event1).

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"") is a tautology and holds.
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") reduces to ""event1 happens"" because C1 is true. So C2 holds exactly in states where event1 holds.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") requires a next state where event1 holds.
- But the context says, after event1 no other events can happen — so from the initial state (where event1 happened) there is no next state. In standard next-state semantics, ""next"" is false when there is no next state, so C3 is false at the initial state.
- Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is asked: C4 is ""C3 always holds"" — we must decide if this can be true given the context.

2. Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology, so C1 holds in every state.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 always holds, C2 reduces to ""event1 happens"" in that state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So C3 asserts that in the next state event1 happens.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" So C4 requires that from every state, the next state has event1.

3. Use the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means there is no next state after the initial state (or, equivalently, a next-state requirement cannot be satisfied after event1).

4. Conclusion:
- At the initial state C3 requires event1 in the next state, but there is no next state, so C3 fails at the initial state (standard next-state semantics make Xφ false in a terminal state).
- Therefore C4 (""always C3"") is false.

Thus C4 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen. So the system reaches the state where event2 has occurred and no further events can occur.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P) and therefore holds.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds and event2 did in fact happen (initially), C2 is true in the actual state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Given the context, once event2 has happened there are no further events or state changes, so the only reachable state is the one in which C2 is true. Thus C2 holds in every reachable state → C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" By the same reasoning, C3 is true in the only reachable state and remains true (no transitions change it), so C4 is true.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
Plan: assume standard instant-by-instant truth for ""event X happens"" (true only at the instant it occurs), material implication for ""If ... then ..."", and ""always"" means true at every future instant.

1. From the context: at the initial instant event2 happens; after event2 nothing else happens. So at the initial instant: event2 = true, event1 = false. At any later instant: neither event1 nor event2 happens.

2. C1 = ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 is true at every instant.

3. C2 = ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" At the initial instant C1 holds and event2 happens, so C2 is true at the initial instant.

4. At any later instant, C1 still holds (it's tautological) but event2 does not happen at those later instants. Thus at any later instant the implication ""If C1 then event2"" is false (true antecedent, false consequent). So C2 is false at later instants.

5. C3 = ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 fails at later instants, C3 is false.

6. C4 = ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is already false at the initial (or later) instants, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Understand the context and how ""happens"" is used
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- Interpret ""X happens"" as ""X happens at the current time moment."" (So a past instantaneous occurrence does not make ""X happens"" true at later times.)

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication with identical antecedent and consequent). So C1 is true at every time moment.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds at every time, C2 requires that event2 happens at every time moment.
- But event2 happens only at the initial moment (by the context). At later times, no events happen (in particular event2 does not happen then, because after event2 no further events can happen).
- Therefore C2 is true at the initial time but false at later times.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That would require C2 to be true at every time. Because C2 is false at later times, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is already false, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial moment event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur at any later time).
- After event2, event1 must happen (but since event2 never occurs, this is vacuously satisfied).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is true at the initial moment because event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now, C2 is true (it holds at some time — the present).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C2 already holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Event2 does not happen (no events after initial), but C3 holds, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step by step:

- Timeline: initially event1 happens, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the actual sequence is: event1 occurs at the start, and nothing else ever occurs. (Event2 cannot occur because it would have to occur either before event1 — but event1 is initial — or after event1, which is forbidden.)

- C1 = (event2 happens) or (event1 happens). Since event1 happened initially, C1 is true.

- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Because C1 already holds at the initial moment, C2 is true.

- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds, C3 is true.

- C4 = (event2 happens) or (C3 holds). C3 holds, so C4 is true (event2 never needs to occur).

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
You ask whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no future events occur after that initial moment).
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here since event2 cannot occur after event1).

Step 3 — examine the conditions sequentially:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Because event1 already happened initially, C1 is true now.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial moment, C2 is true (it holds now, so it certainly holds eventually).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Likewise, C2 already holds now, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" C3 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 ever happens.

C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You ask whether C4 is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context facts:
   - Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true (at the start).
   - After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterward.
   - The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs (it cannot occur after the initial event2).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1 (event2 happens and event1 happens): false, because event1 does not occur.
   - C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens): false, since C1 is false.
   - C3 (C2 eventually holds): false, since C2 never holds.
   - C4 (C3 holds or event2 happens): the disjunction is true because event2 happens (true initially), even though C3 is false.

Therefore, C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must evaluate C4, which is ""(C3 holds) OR (event2 happens)"".

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true (it has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 already happened initially, no further events can occur.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" places a requirement if event1 ever occurs, but it does not force event1 to occur.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" event2 is true, but event1 cannot occur (no events can happen after the initial event2), so event1 is false. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false (and event1 is false), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" No future events can occur, so C2 will never become true; C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" C3 is false, but event2 happens (true). So C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C4 is true.

Examine the statements:
- Context gives: initially event2 happened. (So ""event2 happens"" is true at the outset.)
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens.""

Whether C3 holds or not is irrelevant to the disjunction, because the right disjunct ""event2 happens"" is already true from the context. Therefore C4 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 occurs anywhere, there are no further event occurrences after it).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, no later events occur).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context (event2 already happened initially and no other events happen after event2), event1 does not always happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false in every state (including the next state), C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C2), so it is vacuously true. Therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" We have C3 true, and event2 did happen initially, so the consequent is true. Thus the implication C3 -> event2 is true.

Final answer
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Interpret statements temporally:
   - C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" (globally).
   - C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (next-time C1).
   - C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" (C2 → event1).
   - C4 = ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" (C3 → event2).

2. Use the context trace:
   - At the initial state event2 happened.
   - After event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen. So the rest of the trace has no events.

3. Evaluate each condition at the initial state:
   - C1 is false (event1 does not always happen; at the initial state event1 did not occur).
   - C2 is false (the next state also does not satisfy C1).
   - C3, being (C2 → event1), is true because its antecedent C2 is false (implication with false antecedent is true).
   - C4, being (C3 → event2), has a true antecedent (C3) and a true consequent (event2 did happen initially), so C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
The question asks whether statement C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the scenario and the other conditions.

Step 2 — the scenario
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no future state will have any new events).
- Also after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur initially).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false: at the initial state event1 did not happen (event2 did), so event1 is not true at all times.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false now and no events will occur later, C1 will not hold in the next state either; so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C2 is false), so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C3 holds.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" We have just established C3 is true. The consequent ""event2 happens"" is also true (event2 happened initially). Therefore the implication C4 is true.

- We must decide the truth of C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens.""

Step 2 — Unpack the conditions
- C1: event2 does not happen (¬E2).
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens = (¬E2) ∧ E2 — this is a contradiction, so C2 is false.
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds = E2 → C2. Since C2 is false, this implication is equivalent to ¬E2.
- C4: C3 ∨ E2 = (¬E2) ∨ E2 — a classical tautology.

Step 3 — Use the context

Question: Is C4 (C3 holds or event2 happens) true or false?

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur. Therefore event2 does not happen. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") requires event2 to happen, which contradicts C1. So C2 is false.
- C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is an implication whose antecedent (event2 happens) is false in the given context. A material implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true (vacuously).
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens"". Since C3 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event2.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the listed conditions.

Step 2 — examine and simplify the conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens. (event2 ∧ event1)
- C2: event2 happens and event1 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 holds or event1 happens = (event2 ∧ event1) ∨ event1. This simplifies to event1 (since (A ∧ B) ∨ B ≡ B).
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. Substituting: (event2 ∧ event1) → event1.

Step 3 — logical evaluation
- The implication (event2 ∧ event1) → event1 is a logical tautology: if a conjunction holds, each conjunct (here event1) must hold. So C1 implies C3 by logical form.
- The contextual facts (event2 happens initially and then event1 must happen) also ensure event1 holds, so both antecedent and consequent are satisfied in the scenario.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We need to decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context implies event2 happened, and then event1 happens (so both event2 and event1 occur).
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens. So C1 is true under the context.
- C2: event2 happens and event1 happens. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: C2 holds or event1 happens. Since event1 happens (and C2 holds), C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
C4 states: if C1 then C3. Given C1 implies event1 (by C1’s definition), and C3 is ""C2 or event1"", any situation where C1 holds guarantees event1 (and C2), so C3 must hold. Therefore the implication C1 → C3 is true.

Final answer:
True

- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Since C2 is true (and event1 also happens), C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the listed statements.

Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: identical to C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state."")
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" = (C2 ∨ event2).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" = (C1 → C3).

Simplify and reason
- C2 and C1 are the same statement, so C3 = (C1 ∨ event2).
- C4 becomes: C1 → (C1 ∨ event2).
- For any proposition p and q, p → (p ∨ q) is a tautology (if p is true then p ∨ q is certainly true).

Conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (identical to C1)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens.""  (i.e. C3 = C2 ∨ event2)
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds.""  (i.e. C1 → C3)

Step 3 — reason
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition, so C1 → C2 is tautologically true.
- If C1 holds, then C2 holds, and therefore C3 (C2 ∨ event2) holds.
- Thus whenever C1 is true, C3 is true, so C1 → C3 is true.
- (Also: if C1 were false, the implication would be vacuously true.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the target:
- C4 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds.""

Step 2 — examine each condition against the context:
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state event2 occurs); after event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the context, event2 must happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Event2 does happen in the next state, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 (""If C1 then C3""):
- An implication is true whenever the antecedent is false or the consequent is true. Here the consequent C3 is true (and the antecedent C1 is false), so the implication C4 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has occurred already).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 has happened, event2 is required to occur at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the disjunction in C4
C4 is true if either (a) event2 happens, or (b) C3 holds. But the context already forces event2 to happen (because event1 happened initially and the context says after event1 event2 must happen). Therefore the left disjunct ""Event2 happens"" is guaranteed true.

Step 4 — conclusion
Since ""Event2 happens"" is entailed by the context, C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
First, what is being asked:
- Decide whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially (in the current/initial state) event1 happened.
- Also: After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1), and after event2 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — asserts event1 at time 1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asserts that in the next state (time 1) C1 is true, i.e. event1 happens at time 2.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" — a disjunction: either event1 happens now (time 0) or C2 is true (event1 at time 2).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — a disjunction: either event2 happens (somewhere) or C3 is true.

Trace and reason:
1. By the context, event1 happened initially (at the current state/time 0). Therefore the proposition ""Event1 happens"" (at the current state) is true.
2. Given that, C3 = (Event1 happens) OR C2 holds is true (the left disjunct is true, so the whole disjunction is true), regardless of C2.
3. C4 = (Event2 happens) OR C3 holds is therefore true because C3 holds (a true disjunct makes the disjunction true). We do not need to rely on whether/when Event2 actually happens.

Final answer:
True

First, what is being asked: whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true in the initial situation given the context.

Context timeline (starting state S0):
- S0: initially, event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → S1: event2 happens.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen → S1 is terminal (no events in S2).

Evaluate conditions at S0:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Next state is S1, where event2 happens, not event1 → C1 is False.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C1 is true at S1. At S1 there are no further events, so C1 is False at S1 → C2 is False at S0.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" At S0 event1 did happen, so this disjunction is True → C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" At S0 event2 does not happen, but C3 holds, so the disjunction is True.

Therefore C4 is True. Final answer: True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 is the statement “C3 eventually holds.” We must decide whether that is True or False given the conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.”
- C2: “Event2 always happens.” (same as C1)
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is the implication C1 → C1, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- “Eventually holds” means there is some point in time from which the statement holds; if a statement is already true now, it certainly eventually holds.

Step 3 — apply to the context
Regardless of the dynamics of event1/event2, C3 is true by logic (either because it’s the tautology C1 → C1, or vacuously true if C1 is false). Therefore C3 holds immediately, so it “eventually holds.”

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the four conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" (identical to C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is a logical tautology (P → P), so C3 is true immediately (and at every time).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 is already true now, then it certainly ""eventually"" holds.

Step 3 — relation to the context
- The context (initial event1 and mutual ""after"" obligations) ensures event2 does occur repeatedly, but that detail is unnecessary here because C3's truth follows purely from the identical nature of C1 and C2.

Conclusion
- C3 holds now (hence will hold eventually), so C4 is True.

Final answer: True

Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions C1–C3.

2. Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication of the form P → P (because C1 and C2 are identical).

3. Logical analysis
- Any implication P → P is a tautology: it is true in every situation. Therefore C3 is true immediately (it does not depend on the context about events).
- C4 states that C3 eventually holds. Since C3 already holds from the start, it certainly holds at some time (indeed at all times), so ""eventually C3 holds"" is true.

4. Conclusion
- C4 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
You are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- Context: event2 happens initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no further events can happen. So the actual sequence is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is a redundant conjunction of the same fact; it is true exactly when event2 happens.
- C2: identical to C1, so it is true exactly when event2 happens.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication P → P where P is C1 (or C2). Any formula of the form P → P is logically valid (true whenever evaluated), and in particular it holds in the actual timeline (since C1 and C2 are the same).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This asserts that the implication C3 is true in all cases. Because C3 is a tautological implication (P → P), it is true in every possible case.

Step 3 — Conclusion
C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a conjunction of the same fact twice, so it is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ C1.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is always true whenever C1 holds (indeed it is a tautological implication).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" means the implication in C3 holds at all times/states.

Step 3 — trace events and evaluate
- From the context, event2 happens initially, so C1 (and C2) are true at that initial point.
- C3 is true at that point because C1 implies C2 (they are the same).
- At any other time when C1 is false, the implication C3 (material implication) is still true. Therefore C3 holds in all states.

Conclusion
- C4 is True.
---
What is asked
- Whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Examine the conditions
- C1 and C2 both state ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — they are equivalent to the single proposition ""Event2 happens"" (the duplicate conjunct adds nothing).
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — equivalently P → P for P = ""Event2 happens"", which is a logical tautology (always true whenever P is interpreted).
- The context (event2 occurs, then event1, then nothing else) makes C1 and C2 true in the scenario, so C3 is true in the scenario; independently, C3 is a tautology and therefore holds in all interpretations.

- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True."

We are asked whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

1) From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does eventually happen. Also after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant to truth of C1/C3 except to note no further events follow).

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — True (follows from the context).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (negation of a true statement).
- C3: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — True (same as C1).

3) C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since C3 is true, the disjunction is true (even though C2 is false).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- We must decide whether C4 is true or false.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just event2 happens in the current state (redundant).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That is: event2 holds in every state (globally).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That is: in the next state, event2 holds in every state from there on.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" That is: at every state, the next state satisfies “event2 holds in every state from that next state on.” Formally: G X G(event2).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context
- Initially event1 happens, so at the initial state event2 does not hold.
- After event1, event2 must happen at some later point. So there will be a state where event2 holds.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 does not hold in every subsequent state forever — at most it holds at the state(s) where event2 occurs).

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C2 (event2 holds in every state) is already false at the initial state because event1 happened initially and event2 did not.
- Since C2 is false at least at the initial state, C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") can’t be guaranteed at every state, and thus C4 (that C3 always holds) is false.
- Intuitively, C4 would require event2 to hold in all states after every next state, which contradicts the given sequence (event2 does not hold initially and does not hold forever after it occurs).

Final answer: False
---
First, what is being asked:
- We must determine whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the event constraints.

Interpretation of the context (discrete states):
- t0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we get event2 at t1.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means t2, t3, ... have no events (event2 does not occur there).

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just a redundant way to say ""event2 happens in the current state."" True at t1, false at t0 and t2 onward.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — requires C1 true in every state. This is false (e.g., at t0 and at t2, C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — at t0 this requires C2 to hold at t1. But C2 is false at t1 (since C1 fails later at t2), so C3 is false at t0.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — requires C3 true in every state. We already have C3 false at t0, so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context the only possible finite event sequence is: state0 has event1, state1 has event2, and then no further events occur.

- C1 (""event2 happens and event2 happens"") is equivalent to ""event2 holds"" — it is true in state1 and false in state0.

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") would require event2 to hold in every state. That is false because state0 has event1, not event2. So C2 is false (already at the initial state).

- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") asks whether C2 is true at state1. Even if one tried to salvage this by vacuous truth at the last state, C2 must hold at state0 as well for C4 below — but it does not.

- C4 (""C3 always holds"") therefore cannot be true, because C2 is not true at all states, so C3 fails somewhere and so ""always C3"" fails.

Thus C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 is true, nothing (in particular event2) can ever occur afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 were to occur, event1 would have to occur later.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 already happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, event2 can never happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Event1 does happen (initially), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because no events occur after event1, the next state (and every subsequent state) still has event1 true, so C2 remains true in the next state. Thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since every state after the initial one still has event1 true (so C2 true, hence C3 true), C3 holds at every point, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initial state s0: event1 has happened.
- The context says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened in s0, no event (including event2) can occur in any future state. Therefore event2 never happens, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"". Since event1 is true in s0, C2 is true in s0.
- Because no events can occur after s0, the situation does not change: event1 remains true in every next state. Thus in the next state (and every next state), C2 remains true. So C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true in every state.
- Since C3 holds at every state, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

First, what is being asked: is C4 (""C3 always holds"", i.e. G C3) true given the initial facts about events?

Interpretation note (standard reading): ""event1 happened"" and ""event2 happens"" are instantaneous occurrences at time steps; ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 occurs at some time, no further events occur at later times.

- System facts: initially (time 0) event1 happens. By ""after event1, no other events can happen"", no events occur at any later time. In particular, event2 never occurs at any future time.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is false because event2 never occurs.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" At time 0 this is true (event1 happens at time 0), even though C1 is false.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C2). Consider the next state (time 1): no events happen there (event1 was an instantaneous occurrence at time 0), and event2 will never happen, so C1 is false and ""event1 happens"" is false at time 1. Thus C2 is false at time 1, hence C3 is false at time 0.

- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (G C3). Since C3 is already false at time 0 (and thus not true at all times), C4 is false.

Therefore, under the standard (instantaneous-event) reading, the final answer is: False.

(If one instead treated ""event1 happened"" as a persistent fact true in all future states, C2 would hold forever and C4 would be true — but that is a different semantics than the usual instantaneous-event reading above.)"

Sample responses:
Interpretation and assumptions:
- We use standard linear-time temporal semantics: Xφ (""next φ"") is true at a state only if a next state exists and φ holds there; if no next state exists, Xφ is false. Fφ (""eventually φ"") means φ holds at some current or future state on the same trace.
- ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen."" means the initial state is terminal (no next state). Also event2 can never occur on this trace.

Step-by-step:
1. From the context, event2 never happens on the trace. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true at the initial (and only) state.
2. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds now (so it holds at some state — the current one).
3. C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state after the initial (terminal) state, and Xφ requires an actual next state.
4. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 is false now and there are no future states where it could become true.

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true, given the scenario.

Step 1 — understand the background:
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So the initial state is terminal; there are no further successor states.)
- The clause about ""after event2 no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 happened initially and after that no further events can occur, so event2 never happens.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True — C1 already holds in the initial (and only) state, so it holds now (and therefore ""eventually"" is satisfied).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so there is no state in which ""in the next state C2 holds"" can be satisfied. Under the usual semantics where Xφ (next φ) is false if there is no successor, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false in the only state and there are no future states in which it could become true, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the context gives:
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So there are no successor states where any event occurs; in particular event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3 in the initial state:
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen""): true (event2 cannot happen after event1).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds""): true, because C1 already holds now (so it holds “eventually”).
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): false, because there is no next state after the initial state (no further events/transitions). The standard (strong) next operator Xφ is false when no successor state exists.

Step 3 — C4 (""C3 eventually holds""):
- Since C3 is false now and there are no future states in which it could become true, C3 never holds, so ""eventually C3"" is false.

Final answer: False

(If one instead used a semantics that allows a stuttering/constructed successor state, the answer could differ; under the usual strong-next semantics above, the correct answer is False.)"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true in the given system.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: (event2 → event2). This is a tautology: whenever evaluated in any state it is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — formally X C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — formally X X C1.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — formally G C3 (C3 holds now and at every future state).

Step 3 — use the system facts
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means the initial state has no successor state(s) (the path ends immediately).
- In standard temporal semantics, X φ is true only if there is a next state and φ holds there; if there is no next state, X φ is false.

Step 4 — evaluate the formulas at the initial state
- C1 is true in any state (tautology).
- C2 = X C1 is false at the initial state because there is no next state.
- C3 = X X C1 is therefore false at the initial state (requires two successors that do not exist).
- C4 = G C3 requires C3 to hold now (and at all future states). But C3 is false now, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context constraints.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P). So C1 is true in every state, whether or not event2 actually occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true in any state that has a next state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" By the same argument, C3 is true in any state that has two successor states.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" If every state has successors indefinitely (standard infinite-trace temporal semantics) or there are successors as needed, then because C1 is universally true, C2 and C3 are true at every position and so C3 indeed always holds.

Extra note on semantics: If you use a finite-trace semantics where ""next"" is false in a terminal state and the trace ends immediately after the initial state (so there is no next state at all), then C2 (and hence C3) could be false at that terminal point and C4 would fail. Under the usual infinite-trace / standard temporal semantics (or if states after event1 still exist but with no events), the tautology C1 forces C2 and C3 everywhere and C4 is true.

Final answer (under the standard/infinite-trace interpretation assumed by the usual temporal reasoning): True
---
Step 1 — interpret the setup
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen, so the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).
- Also: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs in the given run (we start with event1 and nothing follows).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is a next-state formula. Because the initial state is terminal (no next state), the next operator is not satisfied here, so C2 is false at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Again requires a next state; since there is no next state, C3 is false at the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" For C4 to be true, C3 must hold in every reachable state; but C3 is false in the initial state, so C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- t0 (initial): event2 holds.
- Rules: after event2, event1 must hold in the next state; after event1, event2 must hold in the next state.
- So the only possible infinite trace is alternating events: t0: e2, t1: e1, t2: e2, t3: e1, ...

Step 2 — unpack the hypothesis formulas
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is equivalent to simply ""event1"" (p ∧ p = p).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is event1 → event1, which is a tautology (true in any state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" means C2 is true at that next state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" means C3 is true at the next state (equivalently: C2 holds two steps ahead).

Step 3 — evaluate C4 on the trace
- Because C2 is a tautology (holds in every state), it holds at t2.
- C2 holding at t2 means C3 holds at t1, and that makes C4 hold at t0.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the formulas
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is just event1 ∧ event1 ≡ event1.
- C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" ≡ event1 → event1, which is a tautology (true in every state).
- C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" (Next C2).
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"" (Next Next C2).

Step 2 — use the scenario
- Initially (state s0) event2 holds.
- By the rules, states alternate: s1 has event1, s2 has event2, s3 has event1, etc.
- But since C2 is a tautology it holds in every state (s0, s1, s2, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate C3 and C4
- C3 (Next C2) is true in any state because C2 holds in the next state.
- C4 (Next Next C2) is therefore also true (C2 holds two steps ahead as well).

Final answer:
True
---
Reasoning:

- The context enforces an infinite alternation starting from event2, so event1 does occur (in the next state) and then event2, etc. But we don't actually need that detail for the logical simplification below.
- C1: ""event1 and event1"" is logically equivalent to ""event1"".
- C2: ""If event1, then C1"" becomes ""If event1, then event1"", which is a tautology (true in every state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" is true in any state because C2 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" is therefore also true (since C3 holds in every state).

Step 1 — what’s being asked:
We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This implication is a tautology (P → P), so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen initially (given), and C2 is true, so the implication is true; hence C3 is true.

Step 3 — combine for C4:
C4 is ""C1 holds or C3 holds"". Since both C1 and C3 are true, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is A -> A, which is a tautology, so C1 is true in all cases.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Since C2 is true (a tautology), the implication ""event1 -> C2"" is true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so their disjunction C4 is true.

Step 3 — Trace with the context (consistency check)
- Context states event1 occurred and event2 must follow, then nothing else can happen. That does not contradict any of the above; it only reinforces that event2 does happen, which still leaves C1–C3 true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s asked:
We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition:

- C2: same as C1 — also a tautology (always true).

- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Since C1 is true (and C3 is also true), the disjunction is true.

Step 3 — event sequence (consistency check):
The context (event1 occurs, then event2 must occur, then nothing else) does not conflict with any of the above; it only reinforces that event1 and event2 occur, which doesn’t affect the tautological status of C1/C2/C3.

Sample responses:
We ask whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context.

1) From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event1 occurs at the start but does not necessarily occur in every state thereafter.

2) C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false — the context only guarantees event1 initially, not in every state.

3) C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (since C1 is false).

4) C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore true.

5) C4 is the implication C3 → (event1 happens). Since event1 did happen initially, the consequent is true in the actual scenario where C3 holds; thus the implication is true.

Step 1 — interpret the background
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the current/initial state event2 is true).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" means in the next state after the initial one, event1 occurs.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 occurs, no further events occur in later states.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is false, because after event2 the next state must have event1 (not event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false now, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" At the initial state, event2 did happen, so the left disjunct is true; therefore C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — where we evaluate: take the initial state (the problem says “Initially, event2 happened”), so truth of the C-conditions is evaluated at that initial state.

Step 2 — examine each condition at the initial state:
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” After event2, event1 must happen next, so the next state has event1, not event2. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” C1 is false, and event1 does not hold in the initial state, so C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Since C2 is false now, C3 is false.
- C4: “Event2 happens or C3 holds.” Event2 does happen in the initial state (given), so C4 is true regardless of C3.

- C4 is the formula ""C3 eventually holds"", where C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"", C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", and C1 is ""event2 happens in the next state"". We must decide whether C4 is true given the system behavior.

Step 2 — system behavior / trace
- s0: initially event1 holds.
- By the rules, after event1 comes event2, after event2 comes event1, so the infinite trace is:
  s0: e1, s1: e2, s2: e1, s3: e2, s4: e1, ... (alternating e1, e2).

Step 3 — evaluate C1..C4 on that trace
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is true at a state s_k exactly when s_{k+1} has e2. Because e2 occurs at odd indices, C1 is true at every even-index state (s0, s2, s4, ...). In particular C1 is true at the initial state s0.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at a state iff there is some future state where C1 holds. Since C1 holds infinitely often (every other state), C2 is true at every state.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true because C2 already holds at every state, so there certainly is a future state where C2 holds. Thus C3 holds at every state.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is likewise true for the same reason.

Also note that nested ""eventually"" operators collapse (F F φ ≡ F φ), so all C2, C3, C4 are equivalent here and true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the scenario and the other conditions C1–C3.

Step 2 — understand the scenario:
- Initially event1 holds (state0).
- After event1, event2 must hold (so state1 has event2).
- After event2, event1 must hold (so state2 has event1), and so on.
Thus the events alternate forever: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, …

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At the initial state, the next state is state1, which indeed has event2, so C1 is true now.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately at the initial state, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 holds now, so C3 is also true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 holds now, C4 is true.

Alternative (brief formal view): ""Eventually"" operators nest collapse (F F p ≡ F p), so C4 reduces to the same eventuality that already holds (in fact C1 already holds), so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- We must decide whether the formula C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. This forces an immediate alternation of events:
  s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — a formula evaluated at a state that is true exactly at states where the following state contains event2.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some current-or-future state where C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there is some current-or-future state where C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — there is some current-or-future state where C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions along the trace
- At s0 (initial): event1 occurs and s1 has event2, so C1 is true at s0.
- Because C1 is true at s0, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at s0 (eventually includes the current state).
- Since C2 is true at s0, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true at s0.
- Since C3 is true at s0, C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true at s0.
- More generally, because the trace alternates forever, C1 holds at every event1 state (s0, s2, ...), so C2, C3, C4 hold at every state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" We must determine whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal — no further events occur after it.)
- Hypothesis conditions:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just ""event1 happens."" So C1 is true at the initial state (because event1 happened initially).
  - C2: C1 holds in the next state — i.e. event1 must happen in the next state.
  - C3: C2 holds in the next state — i.e. event1 happens two steps from now.
  - C4: C3 eventually holds — some future state has C3 true.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence(s)
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" there are no further event occurrences after the initial state. In particular, there is no next state where event1 happens again.
- Therefore C2 (event1 in the next state) is false. If C2 is false, then C3 (C2 in the next state) is false as well. With no future state making C3 true, ""eventually C3"" is not satisfied.

Conclusion
- C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened — so at the initial state event1 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen — a constraint that would force event1 to occur whenever event2 occurs later.
- After event1, no other events can happen — once event1 has occurred, the system has no further events/states (no successors).

2. Simplify the hypothesis conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just Event1 (a tautological duplication).
  So C1 is true in the initial state (by the context).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means Event1 must hold at the immediate successor state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" means Event1 must hold two steps ahead (X X Event1).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" means at some future point (possibly now or later) the property C3 is true.

3. Use the ""after event1, no other events can happen"" fact
- Since event1 occurs initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no successor state. Therefore C2 (which requires a next state) is false in the initial state. Consequently C3 is false as well (it requires two successive states).
- Because there are no future states in which C3 could become true, C3 never becomes true, so ""eventually C3"" (C4) is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- C1 is just ""event1 holds"" (event1 OR event1 ≡ event1).
- The context gives: s0 (initial): event1 happens. And ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events occur in any later state s1, s2, ...
- Therefore event1 holds only at s0 and never at s1 or any later state.
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" requires event1 at s1 — false.
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" requires event1 at s2 — false.
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" requires some future state si where event1 holds two steps later; since event1 only occurs at s0, there is no such si. Thus C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true given the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 at a state, event2 at the next).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 at a state, event1 at the next).

Evaluate the Ci at the initial state (the state where event2 happened):

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - From the context, after event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 holds now, event1 holds in the next state. So C1 is True.

2. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""
   - At the initial state, event1 does not happen now (event2 does), so the antecedent is false and the implication is true. Also, C1 is already true, so C2 is True.

3. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds.""
   - Event2 happens now (given), so C3 is True (disjunction true).

4. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds.""
   - Event2 happens now (given), and C3 also holds, so C4 is True.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the events alternate: event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, …).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" True by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” (initial state had event2).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the implication is true (an implication with a true consequent is true), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Event2 happened initially, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Either disjunct is true (event2 happened and C3 is true), so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — use the context to get C1:
- Initially event2 happened. The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” implies event1 happens in the next state. So C1 is true.

Step 2 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is “if event1 happens, then C1 holds.” Since C1 is true (from step 1), the implication C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 is “event2 happens or C2 holds.” C2 holds, so C3 is true (and in fact event2 also holds initially).

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is “event2 happens or C3 holds.” Either disjunct is true, so C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify what's asked: determine the truth of C4 (C3 holds or event2 happens) given the context and the other statements.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Context: Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (and it did initially), event2 cannot occur at any time.
- Context also states ""After event2, event1 must happen"", which is exactly C1. So C1 is true.
- C2 is ""event2 happens and C1 holds"". Since event2 cannot happen, C2 is false (even though C1 is true).
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"", so C3 is true (negation of the false C2).
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens"". We have C3 true, event2 false, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds or event2 happens"") is true or false, given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This restates the context ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" For C2 to be true, event2 must happen. But:
  - event1 already happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen, so no event can occur after that initial event1.
  - If event2 were to happen, then by C1 event1 must happen after event2, but event1 already happened and would prevent any event afterward. Thus event2 cannot occur at any time without contradiction.
  - Therefore event2 does not happen, so C2 is false (because it requires event2).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" We have C3 = true and event2 = false, so C4 = true OR false = true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no events (including event2) can occur after the initial event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen → equivalently, ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" (an implication).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the context and so holds.
- From the context, event2 cannot happen (because event1 already happened initially and no other events can happen afterward), so event2 is false.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds. Since event2 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: C2 does not hold. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens"". That is True OR False, which is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" Context says initially event1 happened, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is the implication (event2 → C2). Context also says ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" so event2 does happen. With event2 true and C2 false, the implication is false. Therefore C3 is False (and in particular it does not hold after event2).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false (it fails when event2 happens), C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will happen (following event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to just ""event1 happens"". Since event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — this is the negation of C1. Because C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" — this is (event2 → C2). But event2 does happen (because it must follow event1), and C2 is false, so the implication (true → false) is false. Hence C3 is false in the actual run.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is false in the actual (and required) sequence, C4 is not true.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 does occur.)
  2. After event1, event2 must happen. (event2 will occur later.)
  3. After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- Hypothesis facts:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" → equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given the context, C1 is true.
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold."" → the negation of C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
  - C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" → logically: event2 → (not C1).
  - C4: ""C3 always holds."" → universally: whenever we consider the time/event when event2 happens, C3 must be true.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence and evaluate
- From the context, event1 happens initially (so C1 true).
- Then event2 must happen after event1 (so event2 does occur).
- At the time event2 occurs the antecedent of C3 is true (event2 happens), but the consequent C2 is false (because C1 is true). So the implication event2 → C2 is false at the time event2 happens.
- Therefore C3 is false at that time.
- Since C3 fails at some time, ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen — so the initial state is terminal: there is no next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen — i.e., if event2 ever occurs then event1 must occur afterwards. But since event1 already happened and no events can occur after it, event2 cannot occur anywhere.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is vacuously true because event2 never happens.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds in the initial state, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Both parts are true in the initial state, so C3 holds in the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state (the initial state is terminal). In standard temporal semantics, ""next"" requires a successor state; if no next state exists, ""next"" formulas are false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since there is no next state, C3 cannot hold in the next state. Therefore C4 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 has happened, and the system has no successor states (after event1 no other events can happen).
- C1 (""if event2 happens then event1 happens"") is vacuously true because event2 never occurs.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds now.
- C3 (""event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true now.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state (the ""next"" operator fails in a terminal state).
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen (so once we start in the initial state where event1 occurred, there are no future occurrences of event1 or event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" — but event2 never actually happens given the second bullet).

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is vacuously true here because event2 never occurs. So C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds in the initial state, so it holds at some time (now). Thus C2 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 happened initially and C2 holds, so C3 holds in the initial state.

Step 5 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" In the next state no events happen (by ""after event1 no other events can happen""), so in that next state ""event1 happens"" is false (event1's occurrence was in the initial state). Even though C2 (C1 eventually holds) still holds, the conjunction in C3 fails because ""event1 happens"" is false in the next state. Therefore C3 does not hold in the next state, so C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 has already happened initially, and the rule “after event1, no other events can happen” means no further events (including event2) can ever occur after that point. So event2 never happens in any future state.

2. C1: “Event2 always happens.” This is false because event2 never happens.

3. C2: “C1 does not hold.” Since C1 is false, C2 is true (already true initially and at every time).

4. C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Because C2 is true now, it certainly holds at some (in fact the current) time — so C3 is true.

5. C4: “C3 always holds.” For every future time, C2 remains true (nothing can change it), so at every future time it is still the case that “C2 eventually holds.” Thus C3 holds at all times, so C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 can never occur afterward.
- Since event1 happened initially, there is no earlier time for event2 to have occurred; therefore event2 never happens in any run.

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Since event2 never happens, C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (and true at all times).

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds now (indeed at all times), C3 is true (it holds immediately, hence ""eventually"" is satisfied).

Step 5 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 holds at every time (since C2 is always true), so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First: the question asks whether C4 holds (True or False).

Interpretation of the context:
- Initially, event1 has already happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once that initial event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur at any later time.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (given the previous point), so it imposes no additional possibilities.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” This is false because event2 never occurs (no events can occur after the initial event1).
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” True, since C1 is false.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” True: C2 already holds immediately (so it certainly holds at some future time).
- C4: “C3 always holds.” True: at every time point in the run, C2 holds (event2 never happens), so from every time point it is true that “eventually C2 holds” (indeed it already holds). Thus C3 holds at all times, so C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and how ""next""/""eventually"" behave
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So the initial state is terminal: there is no next state reachable from it.
- In standard temporal semantics, ""next φ"" is false at a state with no successor, and ""eventually φ"" (Fφ) is true only if φ holds now or at some reachable future state; with no future states it requires φ to hold now.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" There is no next state, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is false at the initial state, the implication is vacuously true at the initial state; so C2 holds at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state, so C3 is false at the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" For C4 to be true we would need C3 to hold now or in some reachable future state. C3 does not hold now, and there are no future states where it could hold, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — set up the timeline from the context
- Initially event1 already happened (call that state 0 where event1 is true).
- After event1 no other events can happen, so every later state (state1, state2, ...) has no events (event1 is false there).
- Event2 never occurs because event1 already happened and prevents further events.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At state0, the next state is state1, and event1 is false there. So C1 is false at state0.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" As a material implication at state0, C1 → event1 is true because C1 is false (a false antecedent makes the implication true). So C2 holds at state0.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" We must check C2 at state1. At state1, the statement C2 is (X event1 → event1) evaluated from state1: event1 does not hold at state2 either, so the antecedent is false and the implication is true. Thus C2 is true at state1, so C3 (which asserts C2 in the next state) is true at state0.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 already holds at state0, it holds at some (in fact the current) future state, so ""eventually C3"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So in the next state event1 does not occur. Therefore C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false.

- C2 is the implication ""if C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 holds in any state where C1 is false. In particular, in the next state C1 is false, hence C2 is true there.

- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is true in that next state, C3 is true already (in the initial state).

- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 already holds now, it certainly holds eventually.

Therefore C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happens. After that event2 must happen. After event2 no other events occur.
- So event1 does occur (initially) and event2 also does occur (after event1).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"", so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 is True (and event2 also happens), C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — whether or not one reads ""always"" strictly, C2 is true at least at the relevant times; but this is not needed for the final step.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"" — event1 does happen, so the disjunction is True regardless of C3.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify goal
You ask whether C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: event1 happens initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does occur (and event2 will occur afterwards).
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" This is True (event1 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 is True, C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — because C2 is already true in the scenario (C1 is true), C2 holds, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"" — both disjuncts are true (event1 happened and C3 holds), so C4 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 is ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" We must determine whether C4 is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: Event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event1 happens and event1 happens. This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens.
- C3: C2 always holds.
- C4: Event1 happens or C3 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate step by step
- From the context, Event1 happened. Therefore C1 is true.
- If C1 is true, then C2 (C1 or event2) is true (truth of C1 makes the disjunction true regardless of event2).
- C3 states “C2 always holds.” Since C1 is true (a factual occurrence from the context), C2 is true at every point (the disjunction is satisfied by C1). Therefore C3 holds.
- Finally, C4 is ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" C3 holds, so the disjunction in C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (state0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at state1 event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at state2 event2 occurs), etc. So events alternate; in particular at state1 event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the alternation, event2 is not true at state1, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 at a given state is equivalent to ""event2 happens at that state.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 is true at a state exactly when event2 does not happen at that state (because C1 is false).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We evaluate C4 from the initial state (state0): the next state is state1.

Step 3 — evaluate at state1
- At state1, event1 happens and event2 does not happen.
- Therefore C2 is false at state1, so C3 is true at state1.
- Hence C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true when evaluated at the initial state.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So the events alternate: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false (event2 does not occur in the states where event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (true exactly in states where event2 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Thus C3 is equivalent to ""event2 does not happen"" (true exactly in states where event1 happens).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We evaluate C4 at the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 at the initial state
- Initial state: event2 happened.
- Next state: due to the rules, event1 happens, so event2 does not happen there.
- In that next state, ""event2 does not happen"" is true, so C3 holds in the next state.

Therefore C4 is True.

We are asked whether C4 is true.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 occurs, and events must alternate (after event2 comes event1; after event1 comes event2). So the timeline is event2 (now), then event1, then event2, etc.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false because there are states (the event1 states) where event2 does not happen.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" At the initial state event2 does happen, so C2 is true at the initial state (even though C1 is false).

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" At the initial state C2 is true, so C3 is false at the initial state.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" The next state is an event1 state (event2 does not happen there). In that next state C2 = (C1 or event2) is false (C1 is false and event2 is false), so C3 (= not C2) is true in that next state. Hence C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
1. Initially event2 happened.
2. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" implies event1 does happen (after that initial event2).
3. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false, and so is C3 (same as C1).
4. C2 requires event2 and C1; although event2 does happen, C1 is false, so C2 is false.
5. C4 = C2 OR C3 = false OR false = false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 or C3) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. That means because event2 happened, event1 will (must) occur subsequently.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: Event1 does not happen. Given the context, this is false (event1 must happen after the initial event2).
- C3: Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 does happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 = C2 or C3. Both C2 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C4 says:
- C2 = (Event2 happens) AND (Event1 does not happen).
- C3 = (Event1 does not happen).
- C4 = C2 OR C3 = (Event2 happens AND ¬Event1) OR (¬Event1) which simplifies to ¬Event1.
So C4 is true exactly when Event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — what the context requires:
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen.
Given that Event2 did happen initially, the rule ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"" forces Event1 to occur (at some later time).

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Event1 does happen, so ¬Event1 is false.
- Therefore C4 (which is equivalent to ¬Event1) is false.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
C4 is the statement “C3 does not hold.” We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So events alternate forever: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” Given the alternating sequence, at every event occurrence at least one of them happens, so C1 holds whenever an event occurs (and in particular holds initially).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Because the alternation forces one of the two events to occur at each step, C1 is true at all times/steps, so C2 is true.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” C3 is false, so “C3 does not hold” is true.

- C4 is the statement ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. at every relevant point, C1 is true)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (equivalently: C2 holds)

Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So events alternate indefinitely: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate
- Given the alternating sequence, at every step either event1 or event2 occurs, so C1 is true at every step.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context, events must alternate starting with event2: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Therefore at every step either event2 or event1 occurs, so C1 holds at all times.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is thus true.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.

We are asked whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true given the context.

1) What is being asked:
- C4 asserts that C3 is false. So we need to determine whether C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.

2) Interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 has happened (so the initial state already has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 ever occurs, that also prevents later events).

3) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since event1 has already happened initially and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" forbids any events in subsequent states, event1 cannot also happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is false, so C2 cannot hold.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because no events can occur after the initial event1, C2 can never become true; therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — restate context
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the future has no events).
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- Since event1 already happened initially and the context says that after event1 no other events can happen, no events (including a repeated event1) can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 is false, and event2 cannot occur after event1 (no events can occur). So C2 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds.""
- C2 is false now and can never become true in the future (no events can occur after event1). So C3 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 does not hold.""

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 asserts that ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C3 is true at the state immediately after the initial state, given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context (standard temporal reading)
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" means event2 is true in the initial state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" means in every state after that initial state, no event propositions are true.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs (no events occur after the initial event2).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" event2 happened initially, but event1 never happens. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" In the initial state this is True (event2 happens). In the next state it is False (no events happen there, so neither event2 nor C1 hold).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 fails in the next state, C3 is False (it is not true in all states).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" At the next state C3 is False (as just shown), so C4 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened.  
- After event2 no other events can happen, so there are no transitions to a state where event1 (or any other event) can occur. Thus event1 never happens.
- C1 (event1 and event2) is false (event1 never happens).
- C2 (event2 or C1) is true in the initial state because event2 happened.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true along the run: C2 holds in the initial state and there are no further states that could violate it.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") asks about the next state after the initial one. But after event2 no next state exists (no further events/transitions), so the ""next"" state does not exist and the next-state claim fails under standard semantics of the next operator.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Initially event2 has happened, so in the initial state event2 is true.
2. C2 is ""event2 happens or C1"". Since event2 is true in the initial state, C2 holds in the initial state.
3. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means the state where event2 has happened has no successor (no next state). Therefore the only reachable state is the initial state, and C2 holds in all reachable states; so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true in the initial state.
4. C4 asserts ""C3 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state (because event2 forbids any further events), so the next-state formula is not satisfied. Under the usual semantics ""X φ"" is false when there is no successor state.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must evaluate whether C4 (C2 holds or C3 holds) is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 also happens; event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here beyond confirming no additional events occur).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since both event1 and event2 occur, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" This is False OR True, which is True.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must determine whether C4 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened → event1 is True.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 is True.
- After event2 no other events can happen (irrelevant here).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: event2 or event1 → True (since both event1 and event2 are True).
- C2: C1 does not hold → False (negation of True).
- C3: event2 or event1 → True (same as C1).
- C4: C2 or C3 → False or True → True.

(Also note logically C3 = C1, so C4 = ¬C1 ∨ C1, a tautology, hence True.)

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" We must decide if C4 is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition using the context:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore both event1 and event2 happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given both events happen, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the statement: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happens, and after every event1 there must be an event2, and after every event2 there must be an event1. So events alternate forever: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means ""event2 holds at every moment"" (□ event2).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means ""eventually, from some point on event2 holds at all times"" (◇□ event2).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" is the implication (◇□ event2) → (event2 holds now).

Step 3 — evaluate truth of C1–C3 in the context
- Event2 does occur (after the initial event1), and in fact occurs infinitely often, but it does not hold at every moment because event1 occurs at alternating moments. So:
  - C1 is true at times when event2 occurs, but it's not a perpetual true proposition at all times.
  - C2 (□ event2) is false.
  - C3 (◇□ event2) asks whether there is a time after which event2 holds at every future moment. Because of the enforced alternation, event1 will always recur, so there is no time after which event2 holds permanently. Thus C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is an implication whose antecedent C3 is false. A material implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Therefore C4 is true given the context.

Final answer: True
---
First identify the question: we must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step-by-step:

- From the context (initially event1; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen) the system alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... so event2 occurs (infinitely often), but not in every moment/state.

- C1 (""Event2 happens and event2 happens"") is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant). So C1 is true at times when event2 occurs, but not at times when event1 holds.

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") would require event2 to hold at every time. That is false because event1 occurs between event2 occurrences.

- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") would require that at some future point C2 becomes true (i.e., from that point onward event2 always holds). That never happens under the alternating behavior, so C3 is false.

- C4 is the implication ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true (and in fact event2 does happen in the system anyway).

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context we get an infinite alternation: event1 happens initially, then event2 must happen, then event1 must happen after event2, and so on. So event2 does occur (infinitely often).

- C1 (""Event2 happens and event2 happens"") is just a redundant statement that event2 happens — it is true at the times when event2 occurs (and since event2 does occur, C1 is true as an occurrence).

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") requires C1 to be true at all times. Because event2 does not occur at every moment (the system alternates between event1 and event2), C1 is not true at all times. So C2 is false.

- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") asserts that at some future time C2 becomes true. Since C2 never becomes true (it would require event2 to hold at all times from some point onward, which never happens under the alternation), C3 is false.

- C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is a material implication C3 → event2. Since the antecedent C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C4 is True."

Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — model the timeline from the context
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- The context says ""after event2, event1 must happen"" → s1: event1 happens.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → from s2 onward there are no events.

So the concrete sequence of events by state is: s0: event2; s1: event1; s2+: no events.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" That requires event2 at every state from the current point forward. This is false (s1 and later do not have event2), so C1 is false in s0 (and in s1, s2).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C1 is false), so C2 is vacuously true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is true in s1, C3 is true in s0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must check whether C3 is true in s1. C3 at s1 means ""C2 holds in s2."" C2 is true in s2 (again vacuously, because C1 is false there), so C3 is true in s1. Therefore C4 (which asserts C3 in the next state from s0) is true in s0.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
You are asked whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 did happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.
(Those latter facts are consistent with event2 happening followed by event1.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context (event2 did happen), C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C2 is also false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true (C2 does not hold).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication is true whenever its antecedent is false (vacuous truth); here the antecedent C1 is false, and the consequent C3 is actually true as well.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 happened, and the rules force event1 after event2 and then nothing else. So event2 did happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Symbolically C4 is C1 → C3. Since C3 is ¬C2 and C2 ≡ C1, C3 ≡ ¬C1, so C4 is C1 → ¬C1, which is logically equivalent to ¬C1. Because C1 is false (event2 did happen), ¬C1 is true. Also by material implication, an implication with a false antecedent is true.

Therefore C4 is True.

Step 1 — What is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Evaluate the context
- Context states: event2 happened initially. After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1 no further events occur. So event2 does happen.

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" i.e. not C2. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" i.e. C1 → C3. With C1 false and C3 true, the implication is true (an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true).

Reasoning:
- C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (it's just event1 ∧ event1).
- The context says ""Initially, event2 happened"" and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 does not happen at any time in this scenario. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is false.
- C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") has a true antecedent (event2 did happen) and a false consequent (C2 is false), so C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
---
First identify the question: is C4 (""C3 does not hold"") true or false?

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus event1 does not happen at any point (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and there is no earlier occurrence).
- C1 (""Event1 happens and event1 happens"") is therefore false (event1 does not happen).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is false.
- C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds""): event2 does happen (initially), so the antecedent is true; since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4 states ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened (so “event2 happens” is true).
- The context says “after event2, no other events can happen,” so once event2 has happened no event1 can occur afterwards; with event2 already happened initially, event1 never occurs.
- C1 asserts event1 happens (redundantly). That is false (event1 does not happen).
- C2 asserts C1 always holds; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 is “if event2 happens then C2 holds.” The antecedent is true (event2 happened) but the consequent is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 states “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 is false, C4 is true."

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (the conjunction ""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary: event2 definitely happens initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no further events occur. So the actual sequence is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True, because event2 did occur (before event1).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True, because event2 does happen.
- C3: same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 asserts: C2 holds and C3 holds.

Step 2 — unpack conditions and context:
- Context states: event2 happened initially. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: event1 → event2.
- C2: event2 ∨ C1.
- C3: event1 → event2 (same as C1).
- C4: C2 ∧ C3.

Step 3 — evaluate given the context:
- From the context, event2 is true (it happened initially).
- From event2 happening, event1 must happen, so event1 is also true.
- C1 (event1 → event2): antecedent true (event1) and consequent true (event2), so C1 is true.
- C3 is identical to C1, so C3 is true.
- C2 = (event2 ∨ C1): event2 is true, so C2 is true regardless of C1.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is true ∧ true = true.

Final answer: True

Step 3 — C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context rules about events, C3 will become true at some point. (C3 = ""C2 always holds""; C2 = ""if event1 happens then C1 holds""; C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens"".)

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1 is the disjunction ""event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 is the implication: if event1 happens, then (event2 happens or event1 happens). That implication is a logical tautology whenever ""happens"" in the antecedent and disjunct are interpreted at the same time: if event1 happens then event1 happens (so the disjunction is true).
- C3 asserts that C2 holds always (i.e., at every time point).
- C4 asserts that C3 holds at some time (eventually).

Step 3 — Trace event sequences from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rules force alternation: after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So events alternate forever (event2, event1, event2, event1, ...).

Step 4 — Evaluate the conditions
- At any time when event1 happens, C1 is true (because event1 happened, making ""event2 or event1"" true). Thus C2 is true at every time.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.
- If C3 is true (it holds always), then it certainly holds at some time — so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C4 says “C3 eventually holds.” We must determine whether that statement is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (call this P ∨ Q, where P=event2, Q=event1)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: Q → (P ∨ Q).
  - This is a logical tautology: Q → (Q ∨ P) is always true (when Q is true the disjunction holds; when Q is false the implication is vacuously true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a tautology (true at every time/state), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 already holds (indeed holds always), then it certainly holds at some future time — so “eventually C3” is true.

Step 3 — account for the event rules
- The given temporal rules (initially event2; after event1 → event2; after event2 → event1) only reinforce that events occur, but they are not needed to conclude C2 is always true because C2 is true by logical form alone.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
You are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (the proposition event1 ∨ event2)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" That is event1 → (event1 ∨ event2). This implication is a logical tautology: whenever event1 is true, event1 ∨ event2 is automatically true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a tautology (true in every state), it indeed holds at all times; so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If something holds always, it certainly holds at some (in fact every) time in the future — so it also holds eventually.

Step 3 — use the context (consistency check):
The context (initially event2; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen) produces an alternating infinite sequence of the two events, so both events do occur repeatedly. That only reinforces that C1 and C2 are satisfied; it doesn't conflict with the tautological reasoning above.

C4 is True."

Step 1 — identify:  
- C1 = (event2 happens) and (event2 happens) — equivalent to just ""event2 happens"". Given ""Initially, event2 happened,"" C1 is true at the initial state.

Step 2 — examine C2:  
- C2 = (if event2 happens, then C1). Since C1 ≡ event2, C2 is (event2 → event2), which is true (and in particular true at the initial state where event2 happened).

Step 3 — examine C3:  
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds."" In linear temporal logic, ""eventually"" (F) allows the current state (some time j ≥ now). Because C2 holds now, ""eventually C2"" is true now. So C3 holds.

Step 4 — examine C4:  
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 holds now, ""eventually C3"" is also true now. Thus C4 holds.

Conclusion: C4 is True

True
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Understand the setting
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the trace contains event2 and then nothing).
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs (event2 already happened initially and nothing else can occur).

2. Evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is simply equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- Since event2 happens initially, C1 is true.

3. Evaluate C2
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 is equivalent to event2, so the implication is ""if event2 then event2"", which is true. In the actual trace event2 does happen and C1 is true, so C2 holds.

4. Evaluate C3
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds.""
- C2 already holds now, and the temporal ""eventually"" is satisfied if the property holds at the current or some future point. Therefore C3 is true.

5. Evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds.""
- C3 holds now, so ""eventually C3"" is true.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just the same atomic claim conjoined with itself, so C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 ≡ ""event2 happens"", C2 is the implication event2 → event2, which is a tautology whenever interpreted at a time when the truth of ""event2 happens"" is being evaluated (i.e., it is true at any point where the implication is evaluated).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That means there is some time point at or after the current one where C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That means at some time point at or after the current one, C3 is true.

Step 3 — use the context to trace events
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment ""event2 happens"" is true, hence C1 is true at the initial moment.
- Given that, C2 (if event2 then C1) is true at the initial moment (the antecedent is true and the consequent is true).
- Therefore C3 = ""eventually C2"" is true immediately (C2 holds now, so it eventually holds).
- Because C3 holds now, C4 = ""eventually C3"" also holds (eventually of something that already holds is true).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C4 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C4 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and C3 holds"".
- So we need to check whether both C1 and C3 are true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events occur in any later state (so the next state has no events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: if event2 occurs at some point, then event1 must occur in the subsequent state.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1 and C2: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, the next state has no events, so event1 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 (and C2, which is the same) is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Because no events can happen after the initial event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time, so the antecedent (""event2 happens"") is false. An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — combine for C4
- C4 = C1 and C3. C1 is false, C3 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the conditions:
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened.
  - After event1, no other events can happen.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
- Hypothesis pieces:
  - C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
  - C2: Event1 happens in the next state. (same as C1)
  - C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds. (i.e., if event2 happens, then event1 happens in the next state)
  - C4: C1 holds and C3 holds.

Step 3 — reason about the sequence:
- Since event1 has already happened initially and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no events occur after that initial event. In particular, event1 does not (and cannot) happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (and C2) are false.
- C3 is an implication ""if event2 then C2."" Because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (no events can happen), the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is false in all reachable situations, so the implication holds vacuously. Thus C3 is true.

Step 4 — combine:
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3. C1 is false while C3 is true, so the conjunction C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We want to know whether C4 (C1 and C3) holds.

- Context: initially event1 occurred, and after event1 no other events can happen. Thus there is no next state in which any event can occur.
- C1 and C2 assert ""event1 happens in the next state."" Because there is no next state, both C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 is ""if event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 cannot happen (no events after event1), so the implication is vacuously true; C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- “After event1, event2 must happen” forces event2 to occur sometime after the initial event1.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means event2 is terminal. So the only possible sequence consistent with the context is: event1 (initial), then event2, then nothing else.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” Given the forced sequence, both events do happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” Event1 does happen, and C1 is true, so the implication is true. Thus C2 holds.
- C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” C2 does hold, and event1 does happen (initially), so this implication is true. Thus C3 holds.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” C3 already holds now (at the initial time), so it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually). Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the initial facts.

Step 1 — translate the context and the Ci:
- Context: event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen. So the timeline is: event1 occurs, then (necessarily) event2 occurs, and then nothing else.
- C1: event2 happens AND event1 happens.
- C2: (event1 happens) ⇒ C1.
- C3: (C2 holds) ⇒ (event1 happens).
- C4: eventually C3 holds.

Step 2 — evaluate truth of the Ci along the timeline:
- Since event1 happens initially and event2 must happen afterward, both event1 and event2 do occur. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 says: if event1 happens then C1 holds. Because event1 does happen and C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3 says: if C2 holds then event1 happens. C2 does hold and event1 does happen, so C3 is true.
- Thus C3 holds (indeed it holds at least once, and in fact it holds throughout after these facts are established).

Step 3 — conclusion about C4:
- C4 asserts that C3 eventually holds. We have shown C3 does hold, so C4 is True.

Final answer: True

C4 asks whether ""C3 eventually holds"" is true given the context.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else can happen. So the actual sequence is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs (and then nothing).
- C1 = ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" That is true in the actual sequence (both events occur).
- C2 = ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is equivalent to ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (since C1 includes event1), which is exactly given by the context. So C2 is true.
- C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 does hold and event1 already happened initially, so the implication is true; thus C3 is true.
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. From the context: event2 has happened initially (call that state S0). Because ""after event2, event1 must happen"", there is a next state S1 where event1 happens. After S1 no further events occur.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the scenario both events occur (event2 at S0, event1 at S1). So the statement that both events happen (over the run) is true.

3. C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 holds and event2 indeed happens (at S0), C2 is true.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false (it is the negation of a true statement), so it cannot become true in the next state; therefore C4 is false.

Thus C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context: initially event2 occurs (state S0). After that event1 must occur (state S1). After event1 no further events occur (terminal).
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Both events occur along the trace (S0 then S1), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 already includes event2, C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 is true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" The next state after the initial is S1; C3 is false there as well (C2 still holds because both events have happened), so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We evaluate whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the described event sequence. Implicitly we evaluate formulas state-by-state, starting from the initial state.

Step 2 — model the states
- s0 (initial): event2 happens (given). event1 has not yet happened.
- s1 (the next state): because ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 happens in s1. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen"", s1 is terminal (no further events after s1).

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C4 in s0 and s1
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens.""
  - s0: event2 = true, event1 = false → C1 is false.
  - s1: event2 = false, event1 = true → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""
  - s0: C1 is false → C2 is false.
  - s1: C1 is false → C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
  - s0: C2 is false → C3 is true.
  - s1: C2 is false → C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
  - In s0 the next state is s1, and C3 is true in s1 → C4 is true (in s0).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the run terminates at that point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal, but it never happens here).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened and no events can occur after it, event2 indeed does not happen. So C1 is True.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (because event1 is terminal), so there is no next state in which to evaluate C1. Thus C2 is False (you cannot assert ""holds in the next state"" when no next state exists).

Step 3 — combine for C4
- C4 = C2 and C3 = False AND True = False.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context says: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So once we start, no further events (including event2) can occur.  
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is therefore true.  
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true because if event2 never happens from the initial point, it also does not happen in the next state.  
- C3 is the same as C1, so it is true.  
- C4 is the conjunction C2 ∧ C3; since both conjuncts are true, C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify what's given
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened there is no further state with any new events).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given that event1 has already happened and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen (now or later). So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state because after event1 no other events can happen. Under the usual reading, a claim about the next state is false if there is no next state in which it could hold. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — combine for C4
- C4 = C2 and C3. Since C2 is false (even though C3 is true), C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication of the form A → A, since C1 and C2 are identical.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds.""

Step 3 — logical reasoning:
- An implication A → A is a tautology; it is true regardless of whether A itself is true or false. Therefore C3 is true (in all states).
- If C3 is true now (indeed true always), then ""eventually C3"" is also true (it holds immediately, hence at some future time).

Step 4 — connection to the context (optional check):
- The context makes event1 occur initially, so C1 and C2 are in fact true in this scenario; that only reinforces that C3 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1 and C2 are the same statement: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" That is the formula C1 -> C2.
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point C3 is true).

Step 3 — logical observation
- C3 is an implication of a formula to itself (A -> A). Such an implication is a tautology: it is true regardless of whether A (here C1) is true or false.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- Since C3 is true right away (it is always true), C3 certainly ""eventually holds."" Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the event constraints, C3 becomes true at some point (or is already true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: event1 happens initially; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 no further events occur. So the run is event1 then event2 then stop.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (C3 is the implication C1 → C2)

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C1 and C2 are identical formulas. The implication A → A is a tautology: it is true regardless of whether A itself is true or false.
- Therefore C3 is true (indeed true at all points in the run).

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- Since C3 is already true (hence true eventually), C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (and it already has, initially), no further events (including event2) can occur.
- Also: after event2, no other events can happen. (This just says event2 would also be terminal if it occurred.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.
  - Since event2 can never occur (event1 already happened initially and prevents any later events), the antecedent (""event2 happens"") is never true, so C1 is vacuously true.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.
  - C2 is identical to C1, so it is also vacuously true.
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds.
  - C1 holds (true) and C2 holds (true), and logically ""if C1 then C2"" is true here (indeed the two are the same formula, so C1 ⇒ C2 is true).
- C4: C3 always holds.
  - Given the context, C3 is true; there is no change over time that would make it false, so ""C3 always holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (If event2 → event1)
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. (i.e. (C1) → (C2))
- C4: C3 always holds.

Step 3 — reason about truth of C3
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition (A → B with the same A and B). So C3 has the form P → P, which is a logical tautology: whenever you have “if P then P,” it is always true.
- This does not depend on whether event2 actually occurs in any trace; P → P is true in every possible interpretation.

Step 4 — relate to the event context
- The context (event1 initially; after event1 nothing else can happen) implies event2 never actually occurs, so C1 and C2 would be vacuously true in that scenario—but that detail is irrelevant because C3 is true regardless (tautologically).

Conclusion
- C3 always holds, so C4 is True.

Final answer: True

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the question: We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C3.

2. Understand the context about events:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   Since event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can ever happen in any reachable scenario.

3. Examine each condition:
   - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Because event2 never happens in any reachable scenario, the implication is vacuously true (and moreover event1 actually did happen initially).
   - C2: identical to C1, so it is also true.
   - C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, whenever C1 holds C2 holds; in fact C3 is a logical tautology here.

4. ""C3 always holds"" (C4): Given the context, C3 is true in every possible situation consistent with the context (both because C1 is true and because C1 ⇒ C2 is tautological). Therefore C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- C1: event2 ∨ event1.
- C2: ¬C1, i.e. ¬(event2 ∨ event1) which is equivalent to (¬event2 ∧ ¬event1).
- C3: event2 ∧ C2 = event2 ∧ (¬event2 ∧ ¬event1).

Step 3 — simplify C3
- C3 contains event2 ∧ ¬event2, which is a direct contradiction, so C3 is unsatisfiable (always false) in any state.

Step 4 — use the context (optional check)
- The context also forces that after the initial event2, event1 must occur next; that already makes C2 false in the next state, reinforcing that C3 cannot hold.

Conclusion
- C3 cannot hold in any state, so C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is False.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") can be true given the context.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: (event2) or (event1).
- C2: not C1 — i.e. neither event1 nor event2 holds.
- C3: event2 holds AND C2 holds. (So C3 says event2 holds while also neither event1 nor event2 holds.)
- C4: C3 holds in the next state.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 implies ¬event1 and ¬event2.
- C3 requires event2 and C2 simultaneously, i.e. event2 and ¬event2 (since C2 entails ¬event2). Thus C3 is a logical contradiction and cannot be true in any state.

Step 3 — use the event rules (context)
- The system alternates: initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen, after event1 event2 must happen. Regardless, C3 is intrinsically impossible because it asserts event2 and also asserts that event2 does not hold.

Conclusion
- Since C3 is unsatisfiable in any state, it cannot hold in the next state. Therefore C4 is False.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C4 is true or false.

1) Context timeline: initially event2 happens (call that state S0). Rules force alternation: after event2, event1 must happen (so S1: event1), after event1, event2 must happen (so S2: event2), etc.

2) Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" In every state of the timeline at least one of these holds (in fact exactly one in this interpretation), so C1 is true at all states.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false at all states.
- C3: ""event2 happens and C2 holds."" Because C2 is false, C3 is false in every state (even in states where event2 happens).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 never holds, so it cannot hold in the next state.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds.
- C3: C2 always holds.
- C4: C3 holds and event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine given context against the conditions:
- The context states: initially event1 happened; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. 
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we directly get C1 (the conditional holds).
- The rules are general/static in the context (""must happen""), so C1 holds at all times → C2 holds.
- If C2 holds and the rule does not change, then ""C2 always holds"" is also true → C3 holds.

Step 3 — does event2 happen?
- Since event1 happened initially and C1 holds, event2 must happen (immediately after). So event2 does happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 requires both C3 to hold and event2 to happen. Both are satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
1) What the hypothesis asks:
- C4 asserts two things: (a) C3 holds, and (b) event2 happens. We must decide if both are true given the context.

2) Examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context statement ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The context gives a general rule linking event1 → event2, so C1 holds universally; therefore C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 already asserts the universal validity of C1 and nothing in the context contradicts that, C2 does always hold; thus C3 is true.

3) Trace events:
- The context states initially event1 happened. Given C1 (and the context), event2 must then occur after that initial event1. So event2 does indeed happen.

4) Conclusion:
- C3 holds (as shown) and event2 happens (by the rule applied to the initial event1). Therefore C4 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C4 asserts: (C3 holds) AND (event2 happens).

Step 2 — Understand and examine each condition in context:
- Context rules: initially event1 happened; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen. So the rules force an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The context rule is a general rule (after event1 event2 must happen), so C1 indeed always holds; C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a stable/meta-statement that is true under the given rules, C3 is true.

Step 3 — Check the conjunct ""event2 happens"":
- Given initially event1 happened and the rule ""after event1 event2 must happen,"" event2 does happen (immediately after the initial event1).

Step 4 — Combine for C4:
- C3 holds (true) and event2 happens (true), so C4 is true.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C4 is true.

Step-by-step:
- Context: Initially event2 happened; after event2 no other events can happen. Thus no event (including event1) can occur after that initial event2.
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen""): True, because after the initial event2 no other events can occur.
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds""): True (event2 did happen and C1 is true).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): True (C2 already holds).
- C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds""): Requires event1 to happen, but C1 asserts event1 does not happen and the context forbids any events after event2. So event1 cannot happen, making C4 false.

Final answer: False
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is true.

Step-by-step:

- Context says initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Also after event1 no other events can happen.
- Because event2 happened initially and prevents any later events, event1 cannot happen after that.
- Could event1 have happened before event2? No — if event1 had happened earlier, then by ""after event1 no other events can happen"" event2 could not have happened afterward. That contradicts ""initially event2 happened."" Hence event1 never happens.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true (event2 did happen and C1 holds).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true (C2 already holds).
- C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") requires event1 to happen, but event1 does not happen, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C4 is True or False.

Context summary:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 never happens. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 did happen and C1 is True, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds (from the initial state), so C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" C3 holds, but event1 does not happen, so the conjunction is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward.
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — inspect each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Given event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is true and event1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" C2 holds, but C3 additionally requires that event2 happens.

Step 4 — can event2 happen?
- Because event1 happened initially and Rule B forbids any further events after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- There is no time before the initial event1 in the given description, so event2 cannot have occurred before.
- Therefore event2 does not happen, so the conjunct ""Event2 happens"" in C3 is false, so C3 is false.

Step 5 — conclusion about C4
- C4 asserts that C3 always holds. But C3 is false (event2 does not happen), so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that is True or False given the three background facts.

Step 2 — restate the background constraints
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the start event1 has occurred).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs, no further events can occur).

Step 3 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" simply means event1 happens.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is a tautology (if event1 then event1).
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" therefore requires that event2 happens (C2 is true anyway).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" requires that at every relevant time event2 happens (and C2 holds).

Step 4 — trace events under the background constraints
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no event2 can occur at any later time.
- There is no time before the initial moment in the given scenario, so there is no place where event2 can validly occur.
- Therefore event2 does not happen, so C3 is false.

Conclusion
- Since C3 is false, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False

You are asking whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

2. Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given the context, C1 holds (event1 did happen initially).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 does hold, C2 is true (and in any case is tautological).
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" C2 holds, but C3 additionally requires that event2 happens.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This requires C3 to be true (and keep true) — in particular, event2 must occur.

3. Trace events:
- Because event1 happens initially and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" applies, no event2 can occur at any later time. Also there is no earlier event2 (initial event1 is the start). Therefore event2 does not happen.

4. Conclusion:
- C3 is false (event2 does not happen), so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” Event1 does happen (initially), but event2 cannot happen after event1. So C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” There is no way for event2 to occur later, so C1 will not hold in the next state. Hence C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 is false now and can never become true in the future, C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” Since C3 is false and cannot become true in the next state, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C4 is True or False given the context.

1) What the hypothesis asks
- C4 asserts: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
- C3 asserts: ""C2 eventually holds.""
- C2 asserts: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

So C4 requires that in the next state, it will be true that eventually (in some future state) C2 is true, where C2 says that in that state's next state C1 (event2 and event1) holds.

2) Examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true in the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events in any later state.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

3) Trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, there are no later events at all. In particular, event2 can never happen in any future state.
- Therefore ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (C1) is false in every state: although event1 happened initially, event2 never happens.

4) Propagate truth values
- C1 is false in every state.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false in every state (next-state C1 is false).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false: there is no future state where C2 is true.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is therefore false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step by step:

1. What is being asked
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"".
- C3 is ""eventually C2"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"".
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (E2 ∧ E1).

2. Translate the context constraints
- Initially, event1 happened (E1 true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen — so in every successor state after the initial one, no events occur (neither E1 nor E2).
- After event2, event1 must happen — if E2 occurs at some state, then a subsequent state must have E1.

3. Consequences for events
- Because E1 already happens initially and no events can occur after that, no state after the initial one can contain any events.
- If E2 were to occur in the initial state, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" would force a later state to have E1, but no later state can have events — a contradiction. Thus E2 cannot occur at any state. So E2 is false everywhere.

4. Evaluate the C-conditions
- C1 = E2 ∧ E1 is false in every state (E2 never holds).
- C2 = X C1 (C1 in the next state) is therefore false in every state.
- C3 = F C2 (""eventually C2"") is false (C2 never becomes true).
- C4 = X C3 (C3 holds in the next state) is false (C3 is false in the next state, and everywhere).

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the described event constraints.

Step 2 — restate the background
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the background, both do occur, so C1 is true (it becomes true once event2 has happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This is redundant with C1 (it requires event2 again), so C2 is true at the moment/event where event2 has happened.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That means there is some point in time (now or later) when C2 is true. Before event2 occurs, C3 is true because event2 will occur later. At the moment event2 occurs, C3 is true because C2 holds then. But after event2 has happened (and since no more events can occur), there is no future time at which C2 newly becomes true again — C2 was true in the past/current, but ""eventually"" refers to the future from the current point. So at times strictly after event2, C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 (""C3 always holds"")
- ""Always holds"" requires C3 to be true at every time point.
- We found time points after event2 where C3 is false (there will be no future occurrence of C2 from those points).
- Therefore C3 does not hold at all times, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False.

1) Interpret the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so there will be a time when event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2) Check the conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, both do occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This is redundant but true (event2 does happen), so C2 is true at the moment event2 occurs (and immediately when both events have occurred).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Before event2 occurs, C2 will hold at the future time when event2 occurs, so C3 is true at those earlier times. At the moment event2 occurs C2 already holds (so C3 is true there as well, assuming ""eventually"" allows the present). 

3) Key temporal point for C4
- C4 says C3 always holds (i.e., at every time point C3 is true).
- After event2 has occurred and we are at times strictly after it, no further events can happen. From those later times, C2 will not occur in the future (there is no additional event2), so ""C2 eventually holds"" is false at those times. Thus C3 is false at times after event2.

Therefore C3 does not hold at all times, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Let's unpack the context and each condition step by step.

Context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

From this, because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, the system is already in a terminal state and event1 will never occur.

Now examine the conditions:

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event1 does not happen (it cannot happen after the initial event2). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false at all times (it never becomes true), so it never eventually holds.

Therefore C4 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C4 asserts ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point (possibly now) C3 is true.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition:
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen; and after event2 no other events can happen.
- From ""initially, event2 happened"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" it follows that no events occur after the initial state. In particular, event1 never occurs at any time.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This requires event1 to hold (now and at all times). But event1 never occurs, so C1 is false (indeed false at all times).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 says C3 eventually holds. But C3 is false at all times (it never becomes true), so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the system is in a terminal state where event1 will never occur.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"", i.e. from a state onward event1 holds at every future moment) is false (event1 never happens).
- C2 = always(C1) is false (C1 is already false now and never becomes true).
- C3 = always(C2) is false for the same reason.
- C4 = eventually(C3) asks whether there is some future state where C3 holds. Since C3 is false in every state, C4 is false."

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the events must alternate forever: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is a statement about the current state's next step.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. C2 = ¬C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" i.e. C3 = ¬C2 = ¬(¬C1) = C1. So C3 is logically equivalent to C1.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" means C1 holds in every state (globally).

Step 4 — evaluate on the alternating sequence
From the sequence event1, event2, event1, ...:
- At the initial state (which has event1), the next state has event2, so C1 is false at the initial state.
- Therefore C3 (equivalent to C1) is false at the initial state.
- Since C3 fails at the initial state, it cannot be true ""always.""

Conclusion
C4 is False. 

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 says “C3 always holds.” We must decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — clarify the context and the conditions
- Context: s0 (initial): event1 happened. Rules force alternation: after event1 the next state has event2, and after event2 the next state has event1. So the states go: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … (event1 in even-numbered states, event2 in odd-numbered states).
- C1 (at a state s): “Event1 happens in the next state” (i.e., event1 at s+1).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (¬C1 at the same state).
- C3: “C2 does not hold” (¬C2), which is logically equivalent to C1 (since ¬(¬C1) = C1).
- C4: “C3 always holds” (C3 holds in every state).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions over the state sequence
- At s0: C1 is false (s1 has event2), so C2 is true, C3 is false.
- At s1: C1 is true (s2 has event1), so C2 is false, C3 is true.
- In general C1 (and thus C3) is true exactly at odd states and false at even states — it alternates and is not true in every state.

Step 4 — conclusion
Since C3 is false in (for example) the initial state s0, C3 does not hold in all states. Therefore C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial moment event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events are possible).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).

2. Consequence of the first two sentences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, no other events (including event2) can occur at any time after the initial moment. In effect, event2 cannot occur at any reachable time.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". This is false (event2 cannot occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — still equivalent to ""event2 happens"", so false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — since C2 never holds, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 does not hold (so it is not always true), hence C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- You are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — restate the context compactly
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur at any later time).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs at some time, a later occurrence of event1 is required).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This just asserts that event2 occurs (redundantly). Given the context, since event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This requires event2 as well, so it is false (because C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is never true (event2 cannot occur at any future time), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false (not true now or ever), so it is not the case that C3 always holds. Therefore C4 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 is True or False. C4 is defined as ""C3 always holds.""

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to just ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — since C1 is ""event2"", C2 is also equivalent to ""event2.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — equivalent to ""event2 eventually happens.""
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — equivalent to ""always (event2 eventually happens)."" In temporal terms, C4 says: at every point in time, there will be an event2 at some future time (i.e., 'always eventually event2').

Step 3 — apply the context rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no events can happen at any later time.
- Therefore event2 can never occur at any future time.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions under the context
- Event2 never happens, so C1 and C2 (which are simply ""event2"") are false.
- C3 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false because event2 never occurs.
- C4 (""always eventually event2"") therefore cannot hold (it requires C3 to be true at all times, but C3 is false already).

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context forces alternation starting with event1: at initial state event1 is true; then event2 must occur; then event1 must occur again; and so on infinitely.

- C1 = (event2 ∨ event1). At the initial state C1 is true (event1 holds).

- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds initially, C2 is true at the initial state.

- C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" At the initial state C2 is true and event1 is true, so C3 holds at the initial state.

- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state."" Consider the next state: there event2 holds (by the alternation). C2 still holds there (there will be future occurrences of event1 or event2), so the antecedent of C3 is true in that next state, but event1 is false in that state. Thus the implication in C3 is false in the next state, so C3 does not hold there.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. What is asked: whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

2. Interpret the context as a state sequence:
   - Initially (state s0): event1 holds.
   - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → s1: event2.
   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → s2: event1, and so on.
   So the trace is s0: e1, s1: e2, s2: e1, s3: e2, ...

3. Evaluate the conditions at states:
   - C1: ""event2 or event1"" — true at every state (each state has either e1 or e2).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — true at every state (C1 holds immediately).
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — since C2 holds everywhere, C3 is equivalent to ""event1 holds now"". So C3 is true exactly in states s0, s2, s4, ... and false in s1, s3, ...

4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — evaluate at the initial state s0: the next state s1 has event2 (so C3 is false there). Therefore C4 is false (in particular it is false at the initial state).

Hence C4 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step:

- From the context, initially event1 happened. So the factual statement ""Event1 happens"" (C1, redundantly written as ""event1 or event1"") is true at the initial moment.
- The context also says that after event1 no other events can happen, so nothing can occur later to change the truth of C1. Therefore C1 holds at every time — i.e. C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.
- By the same reasoning, since C2 is true and nothing can change it, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also true.
- C4 asserts that C3 does not hold; but we have C3 true, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide the truth value of C4 (""C3 does not hold"") given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (redundant disjunction).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., event1 holds at all times.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., C2 holds at all times.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — the negation of C3.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. (Also, after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 does not occur in the initial situation.)
- So C1 is true at the initial moment (event1 does happen initially).
- However, after that initial moment no further events occur, so event1 does not hold at all later times. Therefore C1 does not hold at all times.
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- If C2 is false, then C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also false.
- C4 is the statement that C3 does not hold; since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 says ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is True or False.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just ""Event1 happens."" The context says initially event1 happened, so C1 is true at the initial moment.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because after event1 no other events can happen, there are no future moments at which C1 could fail. C1 is true at the (only) time, so ""always C1"" is true (vacuously/ trivially true over the timeline).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" By the same reasoning, C2 is true at the only time and there are no future times to contradict it, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C3 does not hold is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
C4 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" We must decide if that conjunction is true.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given ""Initially, event2 happened,"" C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 3 — can Event1 happen?
- Because event2 happened initially and ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" no other events (including event1) can occur after that initial event2. There is no earlier time before the initial event, so event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 requires both ""Event1 happens"" (false) and ""C3 holds"" (true). The conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks:
- We must evaluate whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so C3 is True.

Step 3 — Can Event1 happen?
- The context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Because event2 already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur after that. There is no indication event1 happened prior to that initial moment, so Event1 does not occur.

Step 4 — Evaluate C4:
- C4 requires both ""Event1 happens"" and ""C3 holds."" C3 does hold, but Event1 does not happen. Therefore C4 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C4 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds.""

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is True because the context says ""Initially, event2 happened.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is False, C3 is True.

Step 3 — can C4 be true?
- C4 requires both (a) Event1 happens, and (b) C3 holds.
- We have C3 = True.
- Does Event1 happen? No: because event2 happened initially and the context says ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" so Event1 cannot occur after event2. There is no indication Event1 happened before or concurrently, and the initial occurrence of event2 prevents any subsequent events. Therefore Event1 does not happen.

Conclusion:
- Since Event1 does not happen, C4 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means there is no next state with any events after the initial state.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true (event1 did happen).
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore false.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state after the initial event1 (and in standard temporal semantics a next-state claim is false if there is no next state).

Thus C4 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 is true.
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false: the initial state already has event1 and there is no indication event2 holds there, so ""always"" cannot be satisfied.
- C2 (C1 or event1) is true in the initial state because event1 holds.
- C3 (C2 does not hold) is therefore false in the initial state.
- C4 asserts that C3 holds in the next state. But after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no next state where C3 could become true. Hence C4 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C3.

2. Context summary:
   - Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal — there is no next state where events occur).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 can never occur once event1 has already happened).

3. Evaluate the conditions in the initial state:
   - C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because no events can occur after the initial event1, so event2 does not (and cannot) happen.
   - C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true because event1 does happen in the initial state.
   - C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore false (it contradicts C2 being true).

4. C4 asks whether C3 holds in the next state. But there is no next state (after event1 no other events can happen). Under standard next-state semantics, a ""next"" formula is false in a terminal state. Also there is no state where C3 could hold because C3 is already false in the only state.

Therefore C4 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We ask whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 has already happened, event2 will happen at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (not needed for the core contradiction, but confirms event2 will occur and then nothing further).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 does not happen. This contradicts the context: since event1 already happened and event2 must happen after event1, C1 is false (event2 will occur).
- C2: event1 happens and C1 holds. Although event1 did happen, C1 is false, so C2 is false (cannot hold).
- C3: C2 always holds. Because C2 is already false (and will become false once event2 occurs), C3 cannot be true at any time.
- C4: C3 eventually holds. For this to be true, there would have to be some future point from which C2 holds forever. But event2 is required to happen (because event1 already happened), so there is no point from which ""event2 does not happen"" holds forever; thus C3 can never become true.

Conclusion: C4 is False.
---
We want to know whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

1. From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore event2 will happen (it cannot be avoided).

2. C1 says ""Event2 does not happen."" That contradicts (1), so C1 is false.

3. C2 is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.

4. C3 is ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false (and will remain false because event2 must occur), C3 is false.

5. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is never true, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- C4 asks: ""C3 eventually holds?"" i.e. at some time in the future C3 becomes true.

Step 2 — decode the context and conditions
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. (So because event1 already happened, event2 will (must) happen.)
- C1: event2 does not happen. This contradicts the context (event2 must happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is already false, so C3 is false (it cannot be true now).
- For C3 to ever hold at some future time, from that time onward C2 would have to be true always. But C2 requires event2 never happens, which is impossible because event2 must happen (given event1 already happened). So C3 can never become true.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C3 cannot eventually hold, so C4 is False.

We are asked whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

1) From the context: initially event2 happened; after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 did not happen.

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A). Since event1 does not happen, the implication is still true; in any case A → A is always true. So C1 holds (true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so the statement ""C2 does not hold"" is true; thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, the claim that it does not hold is false.

We are asked whether C4 is true or false.

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not happen (there is no way for event1 to occur after the initial event2).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so ""C2 does not hold"" is true; thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
We must determine the truth value of C4 (""C3 does not hold"") given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C4. The final answer must be either ""True"" or ""False"".

Step 2 — understand the context about events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Because event2 already happened initially, no other events can occur thereafter; in particular, event1 does not occur. (This fact will not affect logical truths below.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical implication of the form P → P, which is always true (a tautology) regardless of whether event1 actually happens.
  ⇒ C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, the claim that C1 does not hold is false.
  ⇒ C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is False, the statement that C2 does not hold is True.
  ⇒ C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, the claim that C3 does not hold is false.
  ⇒ C4 is False.

We want to know whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

1) Understand the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus events alternate indefinitely: e1, e2, e1, e2, ...

2) Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context directly, so C1 is true (and remains true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false (and stays false because C1 holds always).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That would require C3 to become true at some time, but C3 is false now and cannot become true because C1 remains true and thus C2 remains false. Therefore C3 never holds.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 says: ""C3 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point C3 becomes true).

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context: initially event1 happens; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So the execution is event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (infinite alternation).
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Given the rules, every occurrence of event1 is followed by event2, so C1 is true on the trace.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (i.e., at every time point C1 does not hold). Because C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (i.e., from some point onward C1 does not hold). Since C1 actually holds on the given trace, C2 never holds and C3 never holds, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 holds or C3 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
- Conditions:
  - C1: Event1 eventually happens.
  - C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds (so C2 entails that event1 happens).
  - C3: Event1 eventually happens (same as C1).
  - C4: C2 holds or C3 holds (equivalently: event1 eventually happens, since both disjuncts assert event1 happens).

Step 3 — trace the event sequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially, and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event1) can occur at any time after the initial moment.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time (it cannot ""eventually happen"").

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 and C3 (event1 eventually happens): false.
- C2 (event1 happens and C1): false (requires event1 happens).
- C4 (C2 or C3): false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
You ask whether C4 (C2 or C3) is true given the context. Step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means once that initial event2 has occurred, no further events can occur thereafter.  
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial state. So ""event1 eventually happens"" is false. Thus C1 is false and C3 (same statement) is false.
- C2 requires ""event1 happens and C1 holds"" — since event1 does not happen, C2 is false.
- C4 = C2 or C3 = false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the start of the timeline event2 has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, nothing else can occur later).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" only imposes that if event1 occurs, a later event2 must occur; but because event2 already occurred initially and no events can occur after that, event1 cannot occur after the initial event2 without violating ""no events after event2.""

Step 3 — evaluate the components
- C1 and C3: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given that event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after that, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur at any time. So C1 and C3 are false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" That requires event1 to happen, which it does not, so C2 is false.
- C4: C2 or C3 — since both C2 and C3 are false, the disjunction is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus any run contains event1 and then event2 (and then stops).

- From the context: event1 happened initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, nothing else can happen. So the actual run is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, then no further events.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Given the context and the actual run, C1 is true (event1 did happen and event2 did happen).

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That asserts C2 is true at all times. Because C2 is false (now and it cannot become true given the fixed truth of C1), C3 is false.

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" For C4 to be true, there must be some future point where C3 becomes true. But C3 is false and cannot become true (it asserts the falsehood of C1 always holds), so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C3 becomes true at some point given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition with the context
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This follows directly from the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That asserts C2 is true at all times; but C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence and temporal possibilities
- The sequence is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, then nothing else can occur. Nothing in the context can make C1 false later, so C2 remains false at all times. Therefore C3 (which requires C2 to always hold) never becomes true at any time.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
C4 states ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Context: event1 has happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. Thus events alternate, and event2 will occur after the initial event1.
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. (True under the context.)
- C2: Event2 eventually happens. (Same as C1, so also True.)
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. Since both C1 and C2 are True, C3 is True.
- C4: C3 does not hold. That is the negation of C3.

Step 3 — conclusion:
Because C3 is True, C4 is False.

Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So starting from the initial event1, event2 is guaranteed to occur (and then event1 again, etc.).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, this is true.
- C2: same as C1, so also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" True and true → C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Final answer: False

Step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happens. The rules force alternation: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So event2 will occur (indeed infinitely often) after the initial event1.

2. C1 asserts ""Event2 eventually happens."" That is true given the above. C2 asserts the same; also true.

3. C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.

4. C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Because C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
First, identify the question: we must decide whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward. Since event1 already happened initially, event2 does not happen.

Now examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is true (the implication holds; in particular event1 does happen, so the implication is true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This asserts C1 is false. But C1 is true, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Event2 does not happen (from the context) and C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events—including event2—can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false, C3 is false.
- Event2: Given event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" = (False) OR (False) = False.

Final answer:
False

Goal: determine whether C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must evaluate C4 given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C3 asserts C2 is true; but C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Step 3 — trace events from the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- The context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Because event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can ever happen.
- Therefore event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Both disjuncts are false (event2 does not happen; C3 is false), so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
We must determine whether C4 (which is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is true given the context and definitions.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur). After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: Event1 happens and event2 happens (same as C1).
- C3: C2 eventually holds (i.e., at some point C2 is true).
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds.

Step 3 — reason through the sequence:
- From the context, event1 occurs (initially) and event2 must occur afterward, so both events do happen.
- Therefore C1 is true. Since C2 is identical to C1, C2 is also true.
- C3 asserts that C2 eventually holds; because C2 is true (either immediately or once event2 has happened), C3 is true.
- C4 requires both C1 and C3; both are true.

Conclusion:
True

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context about events.

Step 2 — interpret the context:

- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the sequence ends after event2).

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context both occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds (it occurs), it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step)

- Interpret the conditions as temporal statements:
  - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (F event2).
  - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G (F event2)).
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F (G (F event2))).
  - C4: ""C3 always holds"" (G (F (G (F event2)))).

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no future occurrence of any other event is possible. In particular, event2 never happens.

- Therefore C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false. If C1 is false now and at every future time, then C2 (always C1) is false, C3 (eventually C2) is false, and C4 (always C3) is false.

So C4 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C4 is True or False.

Interpretation of the context:
- At time 0 (initially) event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur thereafter (event1 is terminal).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards (i.e. event2 implies that event1 must occur later).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, so there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any future time. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already false at the initial point, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is false and there is no change that could make it true (no events occur), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false now, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Goal: decide truth of C4.

Interpretation:
- Context: at time 0 event1 happened. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events occur at any later time. ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (see below).
- Read conditions as temporal properties:
  - C1: eventually event2 occurs (F event2).
  - C2: C1 always holds (G F event2).
  - C3: C2 eventually holds (F G F event2).
  - C4: C3 always holds (G F G F event2).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 never occurs at any time. So C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false.
2. If C1 is false, then ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
3. If C2 is false at the current and all future times (the system is stuck), C2 will never become true, so ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is false.
4. If C3 is false, then ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Step 1 — Identify what’s asked:
- C4 asserts “C3 does not hold.” We need to determine whether C4 is True or False given the context and other conditions.

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition using the context:
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” True (event2 happened initially).
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds.” True (event2 happens and C1 is true).
- C3: “Event1 happens or C2 holds.” True because C2 holds (and in fact event1 also must happen after event2).
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” This is false because C3 does hold.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 happens (already true).
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" True (event2 happens and C1 is true).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" True — C2 holds (and in fact event1 also happens).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify the question
You ask whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happened. So event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 also occurs (after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Terminal.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (event2 happens initially).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" True (event2 happens and C1 is true).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, and C2 also holds, so C3 is True.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C4 is True or False.

1) Clarify the system:
- s0 (initial): event1 holds.
- After event1, event2 must happen → s1: event2 holds.
- After event2, event1 must happen → s2: event1 holds.
Thus the execution alternates: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, …

2) Interpret the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is true exactly in states where event2 holds (it’s just a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means C1 must hold in every state (globally).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" means at the next state, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" means two steps ahead, C2 is true.

3) Evaluate on the trace:
- At s0, event2 does not hold, so C1 is false at s0. Therefore C2 (""always C1"") is false (because C1 fails at s0).
- Since C2 is false, C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
- Therefore C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context and timeline
- Initially (time 0): event1 happens.
- Rules: after event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1. So the timeline is forced to alternate:
  time 0: event1
  time 1: event2
  time 2: event1
  time 3: event2
  ... and so on.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event2 holds at the current time.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = G C1 (C1 holds at every time).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = X C2 (C2 true at time+1).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X C3 = X X C2 (C2 true at time+2).

Step 3 — evaluate
- C1 holds at times 1, 3, 5, ... but not at times 0, 2, ...
- C2 (G C1) is false because C1 does not hold at time 0 (and many other times).
- C3 = X C2 is false at time 0 because at time 1 C2 is false.
- C4 = X X C2 is false at time 0 because at time 2 C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
We are asked whether C4 (which says ""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and event sequence:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, event2 must hold (so the next state after an event1 state is an event2 state).
- After event2, event1 must hold (so the next state after an event2 state is an event1 state).
Thus the states alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — effectively C1 is just that event2 holds in the current state. So C1 is true in event2 states and false in event1 states.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., event2 holds in every state. That is false, because event2 does not hold in the event1 states.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — since C2 is false in every state (there are event1 states where event2 is false), C2 is not true in the next state either, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C3 is false in every state, so C3 is not true in the next state; therefore C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify what’s being asked:
- C4 says “always (if event1 happens then C2 holds)”. We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Understand each condition:
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens” — this is just the assertion that event2 happens (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state = “event2 happens in the next state.”
- C3: If event1 happens (now), then C2 holds = “if event1 happens now, then event2 happens in the next state.”
- C4: C3 always holds (i.e. at all times, whenever event1 happens, event2 must hold in the next state).

Use the context to check these:
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial time event1 is true).
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” Therefore in the state immediately after the initial state, no events (including event2) can occur.
- C2 requires that event2 happens in the next state after any state where C3’s antecedent holds.
- At the initial state event1 holds, but in the next state event2 cannot happen (by “after event1, no other events can happen”), so C2 is false in that situation.
- So the implication in C3 (“if event1 then C2”) is false at the initial state (antecedent true, consequent false).
- Hence C3 does not hold at that time, so C4 (“always C3”) is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to simply ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X(Event2).
- C3 = ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"" = (event1 → X(Event2)).
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" = G(event1 → X(Event2)).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So whenever event1 occurs, the next state has no events — in particular, Event2 cannot occur in the next state.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- At the initial state event1 is true, so the antecedent of C3 holds there.
- But because no events can occur after event1, X(Event2) is false at that next state, so C3 is false at the initial state.
- Since C3 fails at the initial state, ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means there is no opportunity for event2 after that state (no successor event occurrence).
- C1 says event2 happens. C2 says C1 holds in the next state (i.e. event2 holds in the successor).
- Because no events can happen after event1, the next state does not satisfy C1, so C2 is false following the initial event1.
- C3 requires that whenever event1 happens, C2 holds. But at the initial state event1 does happen and C2 is false, so C3 is false in that state.
- C4 asserts C3 always holds; since C3 is already false in the initial state, C4 is false.

Thus C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 asserts ""C3 always holds.""

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 happens.
- C2: same as C1 ≡ Event1 happens.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds ≡ Event1 happens (since both reduce to the same).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" ≡ ""Event1 holds at all times.""

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not (and cannot) happen after the initial state.
- Since the initial state already has event2 and not event1, C3 (Event1 holds) is false in that initial state.

Step 4 — conclude:
- C3 does not hold in all states, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C4 says ""C3 always holds."" The question asks whether C4 is True.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: same ≡ ""Event1 happens.""
- C3: C1 and C2 ≡ ""Event1 happens"" (both require event1).
- C4: ""Always C3"" ≡ at every time point, event1 happens.

Step 3 — use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (initially), event1 can never happen at any time.

Step 4 — conclude:
Event1 never happens, so C1, C2, C3 are false, and therefore C3 does not hold always. Hence C4 is False.

Final answer:
False

You are asking whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. (Also after event1 no other events can happen, but that does not apply because event1 did not happen.)
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this simply asserts that event1 happens.
- C2 is identical to C1, so it also asserts that event1 happens.
- C3 is C1 and C2 — equivalently, it asserts that event1 happens.
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen at any time.
- Therefore C1, C2, and C3 are false in the actual/possible executions.
- C4 states that C3 always holds; since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
C4 states ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context and the other claims.

Step 2 — examine conditions and context:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. (So event2 has occurred.)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" C1 holds, so C2 is true (regardless of event1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds immediately, so it certainly holds eventually. Thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But we just established C3 is true, so C4 is false.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True, because C1 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True, because C2 already holds now (so it holds eventually).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 happened initially, and the rules force alternation (after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen). Therefore event2 does eventually happen. So C1 is true.

2. C2 is ""event1 happens or C1 holds"". Since event1 already happened, C2 is true.

3. C3 is ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" C2 holds and, by the context, event2 does happen, so the implication is true. Thus C3 is true.

4. C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C3 is true and event2 happens), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
We are asked whether C4 is True or False given the scenario.

1) From the context: event1 happens initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. Thus the sequence will include event2 (in fact they alternate), so event2 eventually happens.

2) C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — True (from the context).

3) C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" — True because event1 did happen initially (and C1 also holds).

4) C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" — The antecedent C2 holds, and event2 does happen (from the context), so this implication is True.

5) C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" — Both disjuncts are true, so C4 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from that initial event1, event2 eventually happens).
- After event2, event1 must happen (they alternate).

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because from the initial event1 the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True: event1 did happen initially (and C1 also holds), so the disjunction is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C2 is true and the consequent (event2 happens) is true (by C1), so the conditional is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C3 is true and event2 happens), so the disjunction is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.""
  This gives three facts for the scenario: event1 did occur (initially), event2 must occur (after event1), and event2 is terminal.
- C1 / C3: ""Event1 always happens."" The context asserts event1 happened initially as a fixed fact, so C1 (and C3, identical) holds.
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and the fact event1 did happen, event2 will happen. So ""event2 happens"" is true in this scenario.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 happens, C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" We have shown C2 is true (and C3 is true as well), so the disjunction is true.

Step 1 — what's being asked:
- C4 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.""
  This fixes every allowed execution to the sequence: event1 (initially), then event2, then termination.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event1 occurs in the initial state of every execution, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 must follow event1 in every execution, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 = C2 or C3. Both C2 and C3 are true, so the disjunction is true.

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds.""
- C3 is identical to C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens,"" so C2 implies C1. Therefore C4 is equivalent to C1 (C2 ∨ C3 reduces to C1).
- The context only says ""Initially, event1 happened."" That does not imply ""Event1 always happens"" (initial occurrence ≠ always).
- The context does imply event2 will happen after event1, so event2 does occur; however without C1 we cannot conclude C2 either.
- Since C1 is not guaranteed by the context, C4 is not guaranteed.

Thus C4 is False."

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Restate context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus, once event1 has occurred (and it has occurred initially), no further events can ever occur.

2. Understand the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = event2 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = event2 never happens (at all times).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" = (if event2 never happens) then event2 happens.

3. Evaluate them under the context
- Because event1 has already happened and no events can happen afterward, event2 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 is true (event2 does not happen).
- And since no events can ever occur after the initial event1, C2 holds always, so C3 is true.
- C4 is the implication: if C3 (true) then event2 happens. The antecedent is true but the consequent (event2 happens) is false. A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1 no other events can happen. Also ""after event2, event1 must happen"" (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (redundantly stated twice but meaning: event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → event2 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" → event2 never happens (at all times).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any time. So:
  - C1 is false.
  - C2 is true.
  - C3 is true (event2 never happens).

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""If C3 (true) then event2 happens (false)"". A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step:

1. Initially event1 happened. The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event2) can occur at any later time.

2. Therefore event2 does not happen. So C1 (""event2 happens"") is false.

3. C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. Because no events can ever occur after the initial event1, C2 remains true at all times, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also true.

4. C4 is the implication ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" Here the antecedent C3 is true but the consequent (event2 happens) is false. Thus the implication is false.

- C2: same formula as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
C4 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" That is true → false, which makes the implication false.

Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P), so C1 holds (true).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 also holds (true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

Step 3 — Evaluate C4
- C4 is ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" The antecedent C1 is true, the consequent C3 is false, so the implication C4 is false.

Goal: determine truth of C4.

1) From context: event2 happens initially. Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — so event2 indeed happens.

2) C1 and C2 are both ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That conditional is true: the antecedent (event2 happens) is true and the consequent is true, so each of C1 and C2 holds.

3) C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 does hold, C3 is false.

4) C4 is ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 holds but C3 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur.
- Also, ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (That forbids events after event1, but does not force event1 to occur.)

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event2 has already happened initially and that prevents any further events; there is no time for event1 to occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" (same as C1) — false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C4
- C4 is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"". Both C1 and C3 are false, so their conjunction C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First identify what C4 demands:
- C4 = C1 holds AND C3 holds.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" and C2 is ""Event1 always happens."" So C3 says ""it is always the case that (Event1 always happens).""

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Because event2 happens initially and no other events can happen afterward, event1 does not (and cannot) happen in the actual run. Therefore the claim ""Event1 always happens"" is false (C1 is false, and C2 is false). Consequently C3 (""C2 always holds"") is also false. Since both conjuncts required by C4 are not true, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so event1 does not occur.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false (event1 does not occur).
- C2 is the same as C1, so false; C3 (""C2 always holds"") is therefore false.
- C4 is C1 AND C3, so it is false.

Sample responses:
We ask whether C4 (""eventually C3"") is true given the scenario.

Interpretation / assumptions:
- An atomic proposition ""eventX"" is true in a state exactly when that event happens in that state.
- C1 = (event1 ∧ event2) means both events happen in the same state.
- ""Eventually φ"" means φ is true in some future state; ""Next φ"" means φ is true in the immediate next state.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Initially (state s0) event2 happens, so event2 is true and event1 is false in s0. Thus C1 is false in s0.
2. The system requires that after event2 occurs, event1 must occur later. So there will be a later state s1 where event1 is true. By the requirement ""after event1 no other events can happen"", once event1 occurs no further event2 can occur afterwards.
3. There is no state in which event1 and event2 are both true simultaneously: event2 was true at s0 only, event1 becomes true at s1, and they do not coincide. Therefore C1 is false in every state.
4. Since C1 is never true, ""eventually C1"" (C2) is false in every state.
5. Hence ""next (eventually C1)"" (C3) is false in every state.
6. Therefore ""eventually C3"" (C4) is false as well.

Final answer:
False

We must decide whether C4 is true under the given scenario. I'll assume standard linear-time (LTL-style) semantics where an atomic ""EventX happens"" means ""EventX is true in the current state"" (i.e. events are state properties), and the temporal operators are the usual next (X) and eventually (F).

Construct the timeline forced by the context:
- s0 (initial): Event2 is true, Event1 is false.
- s1 (next): because after Event2, Event1 must happen, Event1 is true in s1; after Event1 no other events can happen, so Event2 is false in s1 and there are no further eventful states (no state with new events after s1).

Evaluate the conditions state by state:

- C1 = (Event1 ∧ Event2). In s0: false (Event1 false). In s1: false (Event2 false). So C1 is false in every state (there is no single state where both events hold simultaneously).
- C2 = F C1 (C1 eventually holds). Since C1 never holds in any future state, C2 is false everywhere.
- C3 = X C2 (C2 holds in the next state). At s0, the next state is s1 and C2 is false there, so C3 is false in s0. (C3 is false in any state whose next state does not satisfy C2.)
- C4 = F C3 (C3 eventually holds). Because C3 is false in every state of the run, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happens initially, no other events can ever happen after that initial moment.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally E2 → ¬E2, which is equivalent to ¬E2; so C2 is true (it is vacuously true because event2 never happens, and equivalent to C1).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This is (true) ∧ (false) = false. C3 is false (it is inconsistent: it requires event2 to happen while C1/¬E2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false (now and cannot become true unless event2 happens, which is impossible), C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

You ask whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- Determine whether C4 is true given the context and the other conditions C1–C3.

Step 2 — the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 has already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can ever occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 happened initially and forbids any further events.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This implication is true (its antecedent is false), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" False, because event2 does not happen (the conjunction has a false conjunct).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false (it does not hold at the actual time), C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the background.

Step 2 — background constraints
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore, once event1 has occurred (and it has, initially), event2 can never occur.
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 happened initially and that prevents any further events, so event2 cannot happen.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is a conditional with a false antecedent (event2 never happens), so it is vacuously true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" C2 holds but event2 does not happen, so the conjunction is false. Thus C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false (it does not hold), C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 is the conjunction: (Event1 happens in the next state) AND (C3 holds).

Step 2 — understand each condition and timeline (states s0, s1, s2,...):
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- Given ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ⇒ at s1: event1 happens.
- Given ""after event1, event2 must happen"" ⇒ at s2: event2 happens.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (from s0) — that's true (event1 at s1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this asserts that at s1, C1 is true (i.e., from s1, event1 happens at s2). But at s2 event2 happens, not event1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is a material implication. Since C2 is false, the implication is true (vacuously). Also independently event2 does occur at s2, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — combine for C4:
- C4 = C1 AND C3 = True AND True = True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify what's asked
We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and timeline
- Initially (current state s0): event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → in s1, event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen → in s2, event2, and so on (alternating).

Step 3 — examine each condition in the current state s0
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" True, because s1 has event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether in s1 the statement C1 is true, i.e. whether event1 happens in s1's next state (s2). But s2 has event2, not event1, so C1 is false in s1. Therefore C2 is false in s0.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Because C2 is false, the implication C2 → event2 is vacuously true. So C3 is true in s0.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" This requires event1 to happen in the current state s0 and C3 to hold. C3 holds, but event1 does not happen in s0 (s0 had event2). Thus C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the timeline:
- Let S0 be the initial state (event2 happened in S0).
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state S1.
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state S2.
So the actual events are: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, etc. (alternating).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From S0, the next state S1 has event1, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That says: in S1, C1 is true — equivalently, event1 happens in S2. But in S2 we have event2 (not event1), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication with false antecedent (C2 is false), so the implication is true (classical truth table).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" We have event1 happening in the next state (C1 true) and C3 true, so the conjunction C4 is true.

Sample responses:
First: the hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Examine each condition with the context:
- Context says: initially event1 happened. So ""Event1 does not happen"" is false at the initial time.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" → False (because event1 did happen).
- C2: same as C1 → False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That requires C2 to be true at all times; but C2 is already false initially, so C3 is False.

Now C4 = C1 OR C3 = False OR False = False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 is true.

Step 2 — examine each condition in the context:
- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 did occur at the initial moment.)
  2. After event1, event2 must happen.
  3. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event1 does not happen. — This contradicts the context's “initially, event1 happened,” so C1 is false.
- C2: Event1 does not happen. — Same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: C2 always holds. — Since C2 is already false (event1 did happen initially), C2 cannot always hold; C3 is false.
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds. — Both C1 and C3 are false, so their disjunction is false.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- C4 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the context

- After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 did happen and cannot be undone; event2 will occur and then nothing else changes.

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (contradicted by ""Initially, event1 happened"").
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false initially, C3 is false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Interpret the context temporally: states alternate events forever: initial state has event1; the next state must have event2; the next after that must have event1; and so on. So the trace is ... event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

- Interpret the Ci:
  - C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2). This is true at the initial state.
  - C2: ""event2 happens and C1 holds"" = (event2 now) ∧ (X event2). That requires event2 in the current state and event2 in the next state — i.e. two consecutive event2 states.
  - C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" = C2 ∧ event2. This is logically the same requirement as C2 (it still requires event2 now and in the next state).
  - C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = F C3 (at some future state C3 is true), i.e. at some point there are two consecutive event2 states.

- In the alternating trace there are never two consecutive event2 states, so C2 (and therefore C3) is never satisfied at any state.

Therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The context forces an alternating infinite sequence of events: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

2. C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is true exactly at states where the current state has event1 (because the next state then has event2). So C1 holds at s0, s2, s4, ...

3. C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") requires that the current state has event2 and that C1 holds at the same state (i.e., the next state also has event2). But in the alternating sequence no state has event2 and simultaneously has the next state being event2. Thus C2 is false at every state.

4. C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") requires C2, so it is also false everywhere.

5. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") asks whether there exists some future state where C3 holds. Since C3 never holds, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 asserts that ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e., there will be some future state where C3 is true.

Step 2 — understand the context and consequences
- Initially s0: event1 occurs.
- The rules force alternation: after event1, event2 must occur next; after event2, event1 must occur next. So the state sequence of events is: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ... (alternating forever).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 this is true (s1 has event2). More generally, C1 holds exactly at states where the next state contains event2 — i.e., at states that currently have event1.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires a state where event2 happens now AND the next state has event2. But the alternation prevents two consecutive event2s: whenever event2 happens now, the next state must have event1. Therefore there is no state where both event2 now and event2 next hold. So C2 is never true in any state.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Since C2 never holds, C3 never holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 never holds at any state, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
We’re asked whether C4 (C2 and C3) is true given the context:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. So the system alternates: event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, …

Step-by-step evaluation:
- C3 (same as C1): ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" to mean ""holds at all times"" (i.e., at every moment/event), this is false: at the initial moment event2 happened, event1 did not hold then. Even though event1 recurs, it does not hold at every moment (there are moments when event2 holds instead).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., event1 always happens)."" Because C1 is false, C2 is also false (and in any case the mere occurrence of event2 does not make event1 true at all times).
- C4 is C2 and C3. Since C3 is false (and C2 is false), C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C4 (which is C2 ∧ C3) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- C1 and C3: ""Event1 always happens."" (C3 is the same as C1.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. if event2 occurs, then Event1 always happens.)

Step 3 — reason from the context
- The context says initially event2 happened. At that initial moment event1 did not hold, so the statement ""Event1 always happens"" is false (it does not hold at every time).
- Since C1 (and thus C3) is false, and event2 does in fact happen (initially), C2 is false as well (the antecedent is true but the consequent false).

Step 4 — conclusion
- C2 is false and C3 is false, so C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is false.

Final answer:

We are asked whether C4 (C2 and C3) is true given the context.

1) Understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So events alternate starting from event2: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2) Examine the conditions:
- C1 / C3: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""at every relevant time point (globally)"", this is false: initially event1 did not happen (event2 did), so event1 is not true at all times (it does recur but not at the initial moment). Thus C1 and C3 are false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially). Because C1 is false, the implication ""if event2 then C1"" is false in that actual case. So C2 is false.

3) Therefore C4 = C2 and C3 is false (both conjuncts are false).

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- What’s asked: Is C4 (""C3 always holds"") true given the scenario?

- Model the timeline:
  - State s0 (initial): event2 has just happened. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 will occur next.
  - State s1: event1 happens. After event1 no further events occur (terminal).

- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" At s0 this is true (event2 happened and event1 occurs in the future). At s1 it is also true (the antecedent is false there, or event1 already holds).
  - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at s0 this says C1 holds at s1, which is true. So C2 is true at s0.
  - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" At s0 C2 is true, but event1 does not happen in s0 (it happens in s1). Thus C3 is false at s0.
  - C4: ""C3 always holds"" would require C3 be true in every state; since C3 is false at s0, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So we are in a final state (no next state/transitions).

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication, so C1 holds (vacuously true here, since event1 does not occur).

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" C1 does hold, and event2 did happen initially, so C2 holds in the initial state.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (after event2 no events/transitions are possible), so the ""next"" assertion is false. Therefore C3 does not hold.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:

- The goal is to decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true given the context.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication, so C1 holds in any state.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds, C2 requires that event2 happens. In the initial state event2 has happened, so C2 is true in the initial state.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Consider the next state after the initial one. The context says that after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no way for event2 to happen in any following state. Even though C1 would still hold in the next state, the consequent of C2 (event2 happens) cannot be satisfied there, so C2 is false in the next state. Therefore C3 is false.

- C4 states that C3 does not hold. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (material implication); it holds in any state (it is true whether or not event1 actually happens).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds (tautologically), C2 requires that event2 happens (in the same state where C2 is evaluated).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So in the next state we must have C2 true, i.e. in that next state C1 holds (it does) and therefore event2 must happen in that next state.
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (And likewise after event1 no other events can happen.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Initially event2 has happened. Because event2 happened, no further events can happen in any subsequent state.
- C1 is true (tautology), so C2 requires event2 to happen in whatever state C2 is evaluated.
- C3 asserts that C2 holds in the next state, which would force event2 to happen in the next state.
- But the context forbids any event after event2, so event2 cannot happen in the next state. Thus C2 is false in the next state, so C3 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion about C4
- C4 states ""C3 does not hold."" Since we showed C3 is false, C4 is true.

We are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (the run terminates).

2. Interpret the conditions:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a system rule that whenever event1 occurs, event2 follows. The context explicitly gives this, so C1 is true.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is a general rule of the system, it also holds in the next state (and in fact in all states). Thus C2 is true.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2, so C3 is false because C2 is true.
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That asks whether at some future point C2 becomes false. But C2 remains true (the implication C1 holds in the next state and continues to hold), so C3 never becomes true.

Conclusion: C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no further events can happen (terminal state).
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the state immediately after the initial state, C1 is true there.
  - In the next state either event1 happens there or it does not. If event1 does not happen in that state, the implication in C1 is vacuously true; also the rule that event2 must follow event1 does not get invalidated by moving to the next state. So C1 does hold in the next state, hence C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" That is the negation of C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false at the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether at some future state C3 becomes true.

Step 3 — trace the possible states
- S0 (initial): event1 has happened; C1 true; C2 true; C3 false.
- S1 (next): event2 happens (it must), after which no further events or state changes are possible (terminal).
- Because there are no further changes after S1, the truth of C2 cannot later flip from true to false; C3 therefore cannot become true at any later state.

Conclusion
C3 never becomes true, so ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is false.

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis: C4 asserts that C1 holds and C3 holds.

Examine conditions vs. context:
- Context: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This matches C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") and also matches C2 (which is the same as C1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" The context states the rule without exception, so C2 holds universally (i.e., always).

Since C1 is true (by the context) and C3 is true (C2 always holds by the context), C4 (C1 holds and C3 holds) is true.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and conditions
- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen.""  
  This states a rule: whenever event2 happens, event1 must follow (and vice versa).
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. — This matches ""After event2, event1 must happen.""
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. — same as C1.
- C3: C2 always holds. — says the rule C2 is universally true (i.e., it holds).
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate
- From the context the implication in C1 (and C2) is true.
- Because C2 is the same implication and the context indicates it always holds, C3 is true.
- Therefore both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
We are asked whether C4 (C1 holds and C3 holds) is true given the context.

1) Context: initially event2 occurred. The rules say ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen."" So whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event1, and whenever event1 occurs it is followed by event2.

2) Examine conditions:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the first rule, so C1 holds.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Same as C1.) So C2 holds.
- C3: C2 always holds. Since the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is given as a general requirement, C2 is always true; thus C3 holds.

3) Therefore C4 = (C1 holds and C3 holds) is true.

Step 1 — identify C4:
- C4 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur following the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they force an alternation, ensuring event2 does occur).

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false (event2 must happen after the initial event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this asserts that in the next state event2 does not happen. That is false (event2 must happen after event1, i.e. in the subsequent state or at least eventually).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C2 is false, the implication C3 is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 does hold (true), so C4 asserts that event2 happens. And event2 does indeed happen (from the context).

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C4 is true.

True
---
Answering: C4 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 = true, event2 = false). The rules force alternation: after event1, event2 must happen next; after event2, event1 must happen next. So at the next state event2 does happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — true in the initial state (event2 is false now).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" — this says that in the next state event2 does not happen. But we know event2 does happen in the next state, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" — this implication has a false antecedent (C2 is false), so C3 is true (material implication).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" — here the antecedent C3 is true, so for C4 to be true the consequent (event2 happens) must be true in the current state. But event2 does not happen in the current state, so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — restate the context and what each Ci means
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened.
  - After event1, no other events can happen.
  - (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., two steps ahead the original).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e., three steps ahead).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- Initially event1 has happened, and the context says after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore there are no successors after the initial state; no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Thus event2 does not and cannot eventually happen. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — propagate through the next-operators
- Because there is no next state after the initial state, any ""next"" formula evaluated at the initial state is false. So C2 (next C1) is false.
- By the same reasoning, C3 and then C4 are false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e. in the immediate successor state)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So the state reached after event1 is terminal: there are no successors and no further events.)
- Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (irrelevant because event2 cannot be reached if no further events occur after event1.)

Step 3 — reason about event sequences
- Since event1 has already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur now or at any future time. Therefore ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is false.
- Because there is no successor state after the initial state (the system is terminal), any ""next-state"" statement (X φ) is false in the usual semantics. Thus C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is false, and similarly C3 and C4 are false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C4 (which asserts ""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, there are no future events.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant unless event2 occurs.)

Step 3 — examine C1–C4:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
  - Given ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and event1 already happened initially, event2 cannot happen now or in any future state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
  - Since C1 is false in every reachable state (event2 never happens), C1 is false in the next state as well. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""
  - Similarly, C2 is false in every reachable state, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
  - By the same reasoning, C3 is false in every reachable state, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (and likewise after event2 no other events can happen). So once event1 has occurred (which is true initially), there are no successor states in which any further events occur.
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simply asserts that event2 happens. Given the context (event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after event1), event2 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" is equivalent to asserting event2 (or the same as C1). So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" requires a next state where C2 is true. There is no next state with further events (because after event1 no other events can happen), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" would require that at some future point C3 becomes true. Since there are no future states where C3 can become true, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3), where C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2), C2 = ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", and C1 = ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e. just Event2).

So C1, C2 reduce to the proposition ""Event2 happens"". Thus C4 says: eventually there is a state whose next state satisfies ""Event2 happens"" — equivalently, at some future time the immediate successor state has Event2.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, Event1 has happened.
- After Event1, no other events can happen. (Also ""After Event2, no other events can happen"" is given but irrelevant because Event2 never occurs.)
Because Event1 has already happened initially, no further events (including Event2) can ever occur in any future state.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- Since Event2 cannot occur at any future state, C1 and C2 are false in all states.
- Therefore C3 = ""next state C2"" is false in all states.
- Hence C4 = ""eventually C3"" is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Identify what's asked
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" (i.e., F C3). We must decide whether that is true given the context.

2) Simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to: Event2 happens.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" becomes ""Event2 happens or (Event2 happens)"" → still: Event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" becomes: In the next state, Event2 happens.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" means: at some future point there is a state where (in its next state) Event2 happens.

3) Use the context to rule out Event2
- Initially, event1 happened.
- The context states: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no events (including event2) can occur after that point. Therefore Event2 does not and cannot happen in any future state.

4) Evaluate C1–C4 under that fact
- Event2 does not occur ⇒ C1 and C2 are false.
- There is no state where Event2 occurs, so there is no next state in which C2 holds; C3 is false.
- Since C3 never becomes true, ""eventually C3"" (C4) is false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Goal: determine whether C4 is True or False.

Context interpretation
- Initially, event2 has already happened (so the starting state includes event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 implies eventual event2).

Analyze the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" so C1 holds as a rule.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 holds, but event1 does not happen in any reachable timeline because event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event2. There is no prior time before the initial state for event1 to have happened. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
We must determine whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine conditions against the context:
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context statement ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 is true (entailed by the context).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 holds, but C2 additionally asserts that event1 happens. The context says event2 happened initially and that after event2 no other events can happen. That prevents event1 from occurring at or after the initial moment; nothing in the context asserts event1 occurred prior to that. Therefore we cannot conclude event1 happens — C2 is not satisfied.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false (it asserts event1 happens, which is not supported and is prevented after the initial event2), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
What the hypothesis asks
- C4 asserts that ""C3 always holds.""

Examine each condition with the context
- Context:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event2, no other events can happen.
  3. After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches context rule (3), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 holds, but event1 does not happen: event2 already happened initially and no further events can occur, so event1 cannot occur. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 is True or False.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" So we need to decide whether that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the chain of conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (so C2 just asserts C1 is true)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (so C3 asserts C2 is true)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (so C4 asserts C3 is true)

If any one of these is false, all stronger ""always holds"" statements above it are also false.

Step 3 — use the context to test C1
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So there is a concrete occurrence of event1.
- Context: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 occurs, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- Therefore in the actual scenario event1 happens but event2 does not happen afterward — so the implication ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (C1) is false (we have a counterexample: the initial event1 without event2).

Step 4 — propagate falsity
- C1 is false, hence ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
- Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
- Hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true in the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- Also, after event2 no other events can happen (so event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Evaluate this in the actual initial situation: event1 did happen, but because no events can happen after event1, event2 does not happen. So the antecedent (event1) is true while the consequent (event2) is false. Therefore C1 is false in the given scenario.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 is already false in the initial situation, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- In the actual history event1 did happen (initially). Because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur after event1. Thus event1 occurs while event2 does not — the antecedent is true and the consequent is false, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — propagate through C2–C4
- C2 asserts ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 is true or false.

1) Identify the question: C4 = (C3 holds) AND (event2 happens). We must decide if C4 can be true given the context.

2) Understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

3) Examine the conditions:
- C1: event2 happens OR event1 happens. This is true initially because event2 happened initially.
- C2: event1 happens AND C1 holds. This requires event1 to happen in the same state. There is no evidence event1 happens initially, and because event2 happened initially and after event2 no further events can occur, event1 cannot occur later. So event1 does not happen in any reachable state → C2 is false everywhere.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” Since C2 is false in all states, C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 holds AND event2 happens.” C3 is false, so the conjunction is false regardless of event2.

Conclusion: C4 is False.

Goal: decide whether C4 (C3 holds and event2 happens) can be true given the context.

Context summary
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Examine the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given the context, event2 happens initially, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""event1 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event1 to happen (in the same state). But event1 does not happen in the initial state, and there is no possibility of an event after event2 (event2 is terminal). So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial event2 (no events can follow event2), so C2 cannot hold in a next state; C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Since C3 is false, C4 cannot be true (and there is no way to arrange a next state where C2 holds because event2 ends the execution).

Conclusion
C4 is False.
---
First identify the question: it asks whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened. Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So once event2 occurs, there can be no further events; likewise once event1 occurs, there can be no further events.
- C1 = (event2 happens) or (event1 happens). In the initial state this is true because event2 happens initially.
- C2 = (event1 happens) and C1. C2 requires event1 to happen. But event1 does not happen at any time after the initial event2 (and there's no earlier state where event1 happened), so C2 is false.
  - (If one considered simultaneity where both happened initially, C2 could be true initially, but then in the next state no events can occur, so C2 would not hold in the next state.)
- C3 = C2 holds in the next state. Since C2 is false (or cannot hold in the next state), C3 is false.
- C4 = C3 and event2 happens. Because C3 is false, C4 is false regardless of event2.

Therefore C4 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
C4 is the statement: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide True or False given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — true (event2 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — true (C1 is true, and event2 is true anyway).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — true (C2 is true).

Step 3 — check C4
C4 says: if C3 holds then event1 happens. We have C3 = true, so C4 requires event1 to be true. But event1 did not happen: the only initial event was event2, and since after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after event2. There is no information that event1 occurred before event2, so event1 is false.

Thus antecedent true and consequent false → C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — facts from the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. 
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen after that).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — true (C1 holds, and event2 happens).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — true (C2 holds).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" — this is the implication C3 → event1.

Step 3 — decide C4:
- C3 is true, so for C4 to be true we would need event1 to be true.
- But event1 cannot happen (event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen), so event1 is false.
- A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. 
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen; this just says event1 would also be terminal if it occurred.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 and event2 — equivalent to ""event2 happened"". True because event2 happened initially.
- C2: C1 or event2 — true (C1 is true).
- C3: C2 or event1 — true (C2 is true).
- C4: If C3 holds, then event1 happens. This requires: whenever C3 is true, event1 must have happened.

Step 4 — trace events and evaluate C4
- C3 is true (as shown).
- For C4 to be true, event1 must have happened.
- But event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen; therefore event1 cannot happen after that initial event2. Nothing in the context states event1 happened before event2, so there is no basis to conclude event1 occurred.
- Since the antecedent C3 is true but the consequent (event1) does not hold, the implication C4 is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- From the context, event2 happened initially. Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens and event2 happens"") is true (it just redundantly asserts event2 happens).
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", so C2 is false (because C1 holds).
- C3 is ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true (vacuously).
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" Since C1 is true (event2 did happen), C2 never holds, so C3 is true in all states/points of the scenario (it is vacuously true everywhere). Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 is the statement ""C3 always holds"". We must determine whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus the only possible sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 → end.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event2 happens."" Given the context, C1 is true (event2 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication whose antecedent (C2) is false, so the implication is true (vacuously). Because C2 is false at all times in this context, C3 is true at all times.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true at all times, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What is being asked
- C4 states: ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether C3 is true at every relevant time point given the context.

2) Interpret the context as a timeline
- Initially (time t0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at some later time, say t1, event1 occurs).
- After event1, no further events can happen.

A simple timeline: t0: event2; t1: event1; then nothing afterwards.

3) Evaluate the conditions at those times
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" At t0 this is true (event2 happens). At t1 it is false (event2 does not happen at t1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is false at t0 (because C1 held at t0) and true at t1 (because C1 does not hold at t1).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication whose truth can vary by time:
  - At t0, C2 is false, so the implication C3 is vacuously true at t0.
  - At t1, C2 is true (C1 does not hold), but event2 does not happen at t1, so the implication is false at t1.

4) Conclusion about C4
- C3 is false at t1, so it is not true at all times. Therefore ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Reasoning (step by step):

- From the context we get an infinite alternation starting with event1: at time 0 event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, then event1, then event2, … (event2 occurs at every other step but not continuously).

- C1 (""event2 happens and event2 happens"") is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"" — it is true at the times when event2 occurs but false at the times when event1 occurs.

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") would require event2 to hold at every moment. That is false (e.g., at the initial time event1 holds, not event2).

- Because C2 never becomes true, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false, and therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false as well — there is no time from which event2 holds at all future times (after any event2 an event1 must follow).

Hence C4 is False.
---
Hypothesis: is C4 true or false?

Interpretation and assumptions
- Context forces an infinite alternating sequence starting from an initial event1: event1 (initial) → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
- Read “happens” as “occurs at some step,” and “always” as the usual temporal “always (from that point on).” “Eventually” means “at some future point.”

Examine the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens …” — under the context, event2 does occur (immediately after the initial event1). So C1 is true at the time when that event2 occurs (i.e. C1 holds at least once).
- C2: “C1 always holds” — would require that from some point onward event2 is true at every step. That is impossible under the required alternation (there are steps with event1, not event2). So C2 is never true.
- C3: “C2 always holds” — since C2 never holds, C3 is false everywhere.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” — C3 never holds, so C3 cannot become true at any future point. Therefore C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" So we must decide whether at some future point C3 becomes true and remains true.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- From the context the system produces an infinite alternation of events starting with event1: event1 (initial), then event2, then event1, then event2, ...
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is just a redundant way of saying event2 holds at the current point.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means event2 holds at every timepoint.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" is equivalent to ""C1 always holds"" (nesting always does not change the meaning).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" means at some point onwards C1 will hold at every timepoint (i.e., from some time on event2 holds constantly).

Step 3 — trace and reason:
The actual trace alternates forever between event1 and event2, so event2 is true at infinitely many timepoints but is false at the timepoints where event1 occurs. There is no point after which only event2 occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because there is no suffix of the run where event2 holds at every timepoint, C3 never becomes true, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 says ""C3 always holds.""
- C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds.""
- C1 and C2 both state ""Event1 always happens."" (they are the same claim).

So C4 is effectively saying: ""It is always the case that (Event1 always happens).""

Step 2 — understand the background event facts
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the start of the trace).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the trace continues event1 → event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the trace ends after event2).

Step 3 — evaluate ""Event1 always happens""
- ""Event1 always happens"" requires event1 to hold at every relevant time (or in every possible continuation), i.e., it must be true beyond just the initial moment.
- In the actual sequence we have event1 only initially; after event2 no events can happen, so event1 does not occur at later times. Thus event1 is not true at all times.
- Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" is false.

Step 4 — propagate to C3 and C4
- Since C1 (and thus C2) is false, C3 = C1 ∧ C2 is false.
- C4 asserts that C3 always holds; because C3 is false in the actual sequence, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C4 says “C3 always holds.”
- C3 is “C1 holds and C2 holds.”
- C1 and C2 are the same statement: “Event1 always happens.”

So C4 is asserting that “(Event1 always happens) always holds” — effectively that Event1 always happens.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- “Event1 always happens” would mean event1 holds at all times (or at every point along the execution).
- In the actual sequence given: event1 occurs initially, then event2 occurs, then nothing else. Event1 does not occur at the later points in the run.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because event1 does not occur after the initial moment (event2 happens next and then no events), it is not true that event1 occurs at every time point.
- Therefore C1 is false; C2 (same as C1) is false; C3 (their conjunction) is false; and C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: the same as C1.
- C3: C1 and C2 — effectively just ""Event1 always happens.""
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — i.e. ""It is always the case that Event1 always happens.""

Step 3 — trace the events from the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at time 0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs subsequently).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the sequence ends after event2).

Step 4 — reasoning
- The context guarantees event1 occurred initially, but does not guarantee event1 occurs at every time (it does not imply ""always happens"").
- Since C1/C2 assert ""event1 always happens,"" they are not supported by the context.
- Therefore C3 (their conjunction) does not hold, and C4 (""C3 always holds"") is also not supported.

Sample responses:
First identify what's being asked: C4 says ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C3 is true at every moment.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. (C1 ≡ e1 ∨ e2)
- C2: C1 does not hold. (C2 ≡ ¬(e1 ∨ e2) ≡ ¬e1 ∧ ¬e2)
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens. So C3 ≡ (¬e1 ∧ ¬e2) ∨ e2. Simplifying: C3 ≡ ¬e1 ∨ e2.
  (C3 is true whenever event2 occurs, or whenever event1 does not occur.)
- C4: C3 always holds (i.e., at every moment C3 is true).

Find a counterexample moment: the context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" At that initial moment e1 is true and e2 is not true. Plug into C3: ¬e1 ∨ e2 = false ∨ false = false. So C3 is false at the initial moment.

Therefore C3 does not hold at all times, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Interpret the conditions:
  - C1 = (event1) ∨ (event2).
  - C2 = ¬C1 = ¬(event1 ∨ event2) = ¬event1 ∧ ¬event2.
  - C3 = C2 ∨ event2 = (¬event1 ∧ ¬event2) ∨ event2 = ¬event1 ∨ event2, which is equivalent to the propositional implication (event1 → event2).
  - C4 = ""always C3"" = at every moment, (event1 → event2) holds (i.e., whenever event1 holds at a time, event2 also holds at that same time).

- Use the context:
  - Initially event1 happened (so at the initial moment event1 is true, and event2 is not said to hold).
  - The context says ""after event1, event2 must happen"" — that guarantees event2 occurs sometime after event1, not necessarily at the same instant.

- Evaluate C3 at the initial moment:
  - At the initial moment event1 is true and event2 is (presumably) false, so ¬event1 ∨ event2 is false. Therefore C3 does not hold at that time.
  - Hence ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False.

1) Translate/simplify the conditions:
- C1 = event1 ∨ event2.
- C2 = not C1 = ¬(event1 ∨ event2) = ¬event1 ∧ ¬event2.
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2 = (¬event1 ∧ ¬event2) ∨ event2 = ¬event1 ∨ event2.
- C4 = Always(C3).

2) Use the context:
- Initially event1 happened, so event1 is true at the initial moment and event2 is (at that moment) false.
- At that initial moment C3 = ¬event1 ∨ event2 = false ∨ false = false.

3) Since C3 is false at the initial moment, it is not true at all times, so ""always C3"" (C4) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and C3 holds"".

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no other events can ever occur at any later state.
- Therefore event2 can never occur at any future time.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: same as C1, also False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False, because C2 never becomes true at any future point.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 = C1 and C3 = False and False = False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and C3 holds"".
- So we must decide whether both C1 and C3 can be true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so the current state has event1).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Thus once event1 has occurred, there can be no subsequent events in any later state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (This is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur given the previous point.)

Step 3 — evaluate each component
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This requires an event after the initial event1; but no events can happen after event1, so C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point there is a state whose next state has event2. Since no events can ever happen after the initial event1, C2 never holds at any future point, so C3 is false.
- Therefore C4 = C1 AND C3 is false AND false = false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 asserts (C1 holds) AND (C3 holds). We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened — so at the initial state S0 event1 has just occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has occurred (as it has at S0), there are no future states where any (other) event occurs.
- (The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 ever occurs.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" That requires some next state from S0 in which event2 occurs.
- But from S0 (where event1 happened) no other events can happen, so there is no next-state occurrence of event2. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future time C2 is true. Since C2 is false now and no events can ever occur after S0, C2 can never become true, so C3 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
C4 requires both C1 and C3 to be true. Both are false, so C4 is false.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate possibility
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no future occurrence of event2 is possible.
- The clause ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (given event1 already happened and blocks further events).

Step 4 — conclude truth values
- Since no event2 can ever occur, ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1 and C2) is false at all times.
- Thus C3 is always false, and it will never become true.
- Therefore ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Short answer: False

Reasoning (concise):
- The context states event1 happens initially and that after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore no event can occur at any later time, so event2 cannot happen.
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false, and so is C2 (same). Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is false.
- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 never holds, C4 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.
- C1 and C2 both state ""Event2 does not happen.""
- The context states that initially event2 happened — so the claim ""event2 does not happen"" is already false.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false, and C3 (C1 or C2) is false.
- ""Eventually C3 holds"" would require C3 to be true at some future point. But since event2 has already happened, the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" cannot become true later.
- Hence C4 is false.
---
Step 1 — What is asked:
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Context: Initially, event2 happened.
- Also: After event2, no other events can happen (and likewise after event1 no other events can happen).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — but event2 did happen initially, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: C1 or C2 — false or false = false now.

Step 3 — Consider the future:
- Since event2 has already happened and after event2 no other events can happen, the situation cannot change: no future event can make C1 or C2 true.
- Therefore C3 can never become true at any later time.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C4:
- C4 says C3 eventually holds. Because C3 is false now and can never become true, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (the system stops).
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here since event1 did not occur).

Hypothesis breakdown
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — This is false because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" — Same as C1, also false.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" — False OR False = False now.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" — means C3 is true at some time now or in the future.

Step 3 — trace / temporal reasoning
- Event2 has already occurred and no further events can occur, so the truth values of C1/C2/C3 cannot change after the initial state.
- Since C1 and C2 are already false and cannot become true, C3 can never become true.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

- C1 says ""event2 happens."" From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 cannot happen at any time. Therefore C1 is false at all times.

- C2 says ""event1 happens or C1 holds."" At the initial time event1 did happen, so C2 is true at that initial moment. But ""event1 happens"" is an occurrence at that moment; at later times that occurrence does not reoccur, and C1 never becomes true (event2 never happens). Thus C2 is not true at all later times.

- C3 asserts ""C2 always holds."" Since we just saw C2 fails at times after the initial moment, C3 is false.

- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"" — that is true because C3 is false.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 is the statement ""C3 does not hold"". We must decide whether that statement is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 ⇔ (event2 happens).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" ⇔ (event1 happens) or (event2 happens).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. C2 is true at all times in the system.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — the negation of C3.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate
- Initially, event1 happened. So (event1 happens) is true in the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1; there are no further events.
- Since event1 has happened (and no events change that), C2 = (event1 or event2) is true in the initial state and remains true thereafter (there are no changes that could make it false).
- Therefore C2 holds at all times, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"". Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same event).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — so C2 is true iff event1 happens or event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 always holds.""
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" (negation of C3).

Step 3 — trace the events
- Initially event1 happened, so event1 is true.
- Because event1 happened, no other events can happen afterward, so event2 does not happen.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 did not happen).
- C2 is true because event1 did happen.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true: since event1 happened, the disjunction in C2 is satisfied, so C2 holds (and thus holds at all times).
- C4 is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.

   - C3: C1 and C2, so equivalently ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" i.e. if event2 eventually happens, then event1 happens.

2. Use the context:
   - Initially, event2 happened — so event2 does in fact happen (so C1, C2, and therefore C3 are true).
   - After event2, no other events can happen — so once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterward.
   - The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" only says event1 implies a later event2; it does not require event1 to have occurred whenever event2 occurs.

3. Evaluate C4:
   - C3 is true (because event2 happened initially), but that does not force event1 to have happened. Event1 could have never occurred at all; the context allows event2 to occur without any prior event1.
   - Therefore C3 does not imply event1.

So C4 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the claim: C4 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" We must determine whether this implication is true under the given context.

2. Examine conditions:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 eventually happens.
- C3: C1 and C2 hold.

3. Evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- Since event2 already happened initially, ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (it has occurred). So C1 is true and C2 is true. Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) is true.

4. Check the implication in C4:
- Given that event2 has already occurred initially and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" no other events (including event1) can occur at any later time.
- There is no possibility for event1 to have occurred before the initial event2 in the given description (the context specifies event2 happened initially), so event1 does not occur in any allowed sequence.
- Thus the antecedent of C4 (C3) is true, but the consequent (event1 happens) is false. An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4: If C3 holds, then event1 happens.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 eventually happens.
- C3: C1 and C2, i.e., event2 eventually happens (the conjunction is equivalent to a single claim that event2 eventually happens).
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened (so event2 does happen).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then later event2 occurs).
  - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially, event2 does eventually happen, so C3 holds.
- After that initial event2, no other events can happen, so event1 cannot happen after the initial event2 (and there is no time before the initial moment for event1 to have occurred).
- Therefore there is a valid execution (the actual one described) where C3 is true but event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- The implication ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" is not guaranteed by the context (we have a counterexample), so C4 is False.

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether statement C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the context (""After event2, event1 must happen""), so C1 is true.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds. Since C1 holds (true), C2 is true (the disjunction is true).
- C3: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This is the same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". Both C2 and C3 are true, so their disjunction C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step-by-step:

1. From the context: event2 did happen initially, and the rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means the implication ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" is true. That directly makes C1 true (and C3, which is identical to C1, also true).

2. C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 is true (and in fact event1 also happens because event2 happened and the rule requires it).

3. C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are true, so their disjunction C4 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 → event1.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Not needed for the disjunction but implies event1 occurs and then stops.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context rule, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" C1 holds (true), and event1 also happens (because event2 happened and implies event1), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We evaluate the temporal sequence starting from the initial state (time 0).

Context interpretation:
- At time 0: event1 happened.
- Rule A: after event1, event2 must happen (so at the next time instant).
- Rule B: after event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the system alternates: time 0: event1, time 1: event2, time 2: event1, etc.

Now evaluate the conditions at time 0:

- C1: ""event1 or event2"" — at time 0 this is True (event1 happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — check time 1: time 1 has event2, so C1 at time 1 is True. Therefore C2 at time 0 is True.
- C3: ""event1 and C2"" — at time 0 event1 is True and C2 is True, so C3 at time 0 is True.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — we need C3 at time 1. At time 1:
  - event1 is False (time 1 has event2),
  - C2 at time 1 is True (since at time 2 there is event1, so C1 holds at time 2),
  - therefore C3 at time 1 (""event1 and C2"") is False.

So C3 does not hold at time 1, hence C4 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine whether C4 is true given the context.

1) Interpret the context as a state sequence with ""next state"" semantics:
- t0 (initial): event1 happens.
- Rule: if event1 happens at a state, then event2 happens in the next state.
- Rule: if event2 happens at a state, then event1 happens in the next state.
Thus the events alternate: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, ...

2) Evaluate the conditions at t0 and t1:
- C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens""): true at any state where one of the events occurs. At t0, event1 happens, so C1 is true at t0.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): at t0, the next state is t1; at t1 event2 happens, so C1 is true at t1. Hence C2 is true at t0.
- C3 (""event1 happens and C2 holds""): at t0, event1 happens and C2 is true (as just shown), so C3 is true at t0.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state""): this asks whether C3 is true at t1. For C3 to be true at t1 we need (a) event1 happens at t1 and (b) C2 holds at t1 (i.e., C1 holds at t2). But at t1 event2 happens (not event1), so condition (a) fails. Therefore C3 is false at t1, so C4 is false at t0.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

1) Model the timeline from the context:
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"" -> s1: event2.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"" -> s2: event1.
- This repeats: events alternate (…, event1, event2, event1, event2, …).

2) Evaluate the conditions at the initial state s0 (unless otherwise specified, these claims are evaluated from the start):
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state s1 has event2 → C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True at s0, C2 is False at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" For C3 to be True, C2 must hold in every state. But C2 is already False at s0, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is False at s0, C4 is False.

(As a note: C2 is true in some later states (e.g., at s1 C1 is false so C2 true there), but it is not true in every state, so C3 fails, and hence C4 fails.)

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 says “C3 always holds.” We must decide whether that statement is true given the context rules about events.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happens. After any event1, event2 must happen next. After any event2, event1 must happen next. So the trace of states is: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … (alternating forever).
- Interpret the Ci:
  - C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (a proposition evaluated at a state; at s it means the next state has event2)
  - C2: “C1 does not hold.” (negation of C1 at the same state)
  - C3: “C2 always holds.” (globally: C2 holds at the current and all future states)
  - C4: “C3 always holds.” (globally: C3 holds at the current and all future states)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions along the alternating trace
- At s0 (initial): next state s1 has event2, so C1 is true at s0. Hence C2 is false at s0.
- At s1: next state s2 has event1, so C1 is false at s1; hence C2 is true at s1.
- At s2: next state s3 has event2, so C1 true at s2; C2 false at s2.
- So C2 alternates: false at s0, true at s1, false at s2, etc. There is no point after which C2 holds forever.

Step 4 — truth of C3 and C4
- C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false at s0 because C2 is false at s0 (and in fact C2 is not true at all future states either).
- More generally, there is no state from which C2 holds at that state and at all future states (because C2 keeps flipping), so C3 is false at every state.
- C4 (“C3 always holds”) therefore is false: C3 does not hold (anywhere), so it does not hold always.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C4 says “C3 always holds” (i.e., at every state C3 is true).

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., Event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C3: “C2 always holds” (i.e., at every state, Event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C4: “C3 always holds” (i.e., at every state, C2 always holds).

Step 3 — use the context and trace states:
- Initial state S0: event1 happened.
- The context requires: after event1, event2 must happen. Interpreting “after” as the next state gives that in S1 event2 must happen.
- Therefore C1 is true at S0 (event2 does happen in the next state).
- Hence C2 (which asserts C1 is false) is false at S0.
- Since C2 is false at S0, C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false.
- Since C3 is false, C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must evaluate C4, where C4 = C1 and C3.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., C2 ∨ event1)

Step 2 — use the context to determine which events occur when:
- Initially (current state), event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies the next state must have event2 (not event1).
- Then after that state, event1 must happen, so event1 occurs in the following state, and the sequence alternates.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions relative to the next state:
- In the next state after the initial one, event2 occurs, so event1 does not happen there.
- Therefore C1 (event1 in the next state) is false. C2 is the same, so false.
- C3 = (C2 ∨ event1) is false ∨ false = false.
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 = false ∧ false = false.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (call that state 0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state, state 1, event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in state 2, event1 occurs), and so on alternating.

Step 3 — examine each condition (all referring to the ""next state"")
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state. Given the context, the next state (state 1) has event2, not event1 — so C1 is false.
- C2: Same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: C2 holds or event1 happens (in the next state). That is C2 ∨ (event1 in next state) = false ∨ false = false.
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds = false ∧ false = false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 is true or false.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So events alternate: event1, then event2 in the next state, then event1, etc.
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: event1 happens in the next state. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 holds or event1 happens. (so C3 is true iff event1 happens in the next state)
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds.

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- Since initially event1 happened, the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” forces event2 in the next state. Therefore event1 does not happen in the next state.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (event1 in next state): false.
- C2: false.
- C3: (C2 or event1 in next state) = false or false = false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — what each condition requires
- C1: ""Event1 happens"" (stated twice but equivalent to one occurrence requirement).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., C1 is true (at least) in the actual timeline (or at all times).
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 or C3 (so C4 is true iff C2 is true or C3 is true).

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate events
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore, once event2 has happened (and it has, initially), event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- There is no information that event1 happened before that initial event2; the given initial fact is that event2 happened at the start. So in the actual timeline/event sequence, event1 does not occur.
- Hence C1 is false, and C3 (same) is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false because C1 does not hold.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C4 = C2 or C3 = false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We need to decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens"" (the repeated phrasing is equivalent to a single assertion that event1 happens).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., event1 happens at all times (global/always).
- C3: same as C1 — event1 happens.
- So C4 = (always event1) OR (event1 happens).

Step 3 — trace the events from the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen. Because event2 has happened initially, no event1 can happen at any later time (there is already an event2 and that blocks any subsequent events).
- Therefore event1 does not happen at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (event1 happens): false.
- C3 (same): false.
- C2 (always C1): false (since C1 is false).
- C4 = C2 or C3 = false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We must determine whether C4 is True given the context.

Step 2 — understand conditions:
- C1: Event1 happens (stated twice, same as ""Event1 happens"").
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., Event1 happens in every relevant state / at all times).
- C3: same as C1 (Event1 happens).
- C4: C2 or C3 (either C1 always holds, or C1 holds).

Step 3 — trace event possibilities from the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial moment event2 has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has happened (and it does initially), no event1 can ever happen afterwards, and there is no earlier time mentioned when event1 occurred. So event1 does not happen at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C1–C4:
- C1 is false because event1 never happens.
- C2 (""always C1"") is false because C1 is false at the initial (and only) state.
- C3 is false (same as C1).
- C4 = C2 or C3 = false or false = false.

Sample responses:
First identify what's being asked: is C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") true or false given the context?

Understand the context and the conditions:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. (So ""event1 happens"" is true.)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant way of saying ""event1 happens"". So C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" — an implication.

Evaluate the implication: the antecedent C1 is true and the consequent C3 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This just asserts that event1 happens (redundant repetition).
- C2: same as C1 — it also asserts that event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e., C3 = not(C2).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" — i.e., C4 = (C1 → C3) = (C1 → not C2).

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate C1–C3
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen. Therefore C1 is true and C2 (identical) is true.
- Since C2 is true, C3 = not(C2) is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is the implication (C1 → C3). That is True → False, which makes the implication False.

Final answer:
False
---
You're asking whether C4 (if C1 holds then C3 holds) is true given the context.

Step-by-step:
- Context: event1 happened initially. Therefore ""event1 happens"" is true.
- C1 asserts ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" — so C1 is true.
- C2 asserts the same thing, so C2 is also true.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4 is the implication C1 -> C3. With C1 true and C3 false, the implication is false.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False.

1) From context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time.  
2) C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (follows from 1).  
3) C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — True, because C1 already holds from the start (so it holds now and thus eventually).  
4) C3: ""C2 always holds."" — True, because at every time point C1 already holds, so at every time point it is true that eventually C1 holds.  
5) C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — This is the negation of C3. Since C3 holds, C4 is False.

Final answer: False

You are asking whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds""): since C1 already holds now (and forever), it certainly holds at some future time — so C2 is true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds""): because C2 holds now and will continue to hold at every time (C1 is always true), C3 is true.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is the negation of a true statement, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False

You ask whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 has already happened initially, no further events can occur at any later time. The rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given (1), this is true.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is already true from the start, so it certainly holds at some (indeed every) future time — C2 is true.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds."" At every timepoint, C2 is true (because event2 never occurs), so C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:
- Context: event2 happened initially. After event2, no other events can happen. Also: after event1, event2 must happen.
- From the context, since event2 already happened and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule, so C1 is true.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 holds, but event1 does not happen (as argued), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is true while C3 is false, so the implication C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- event2 happened initially.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur after that initial event2).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.

Step 2 — consequences for event1
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after it, event1 cannot happen (there is no time for event1 to occur before the initial event2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the given rule, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is true but event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is true while C3 is false, so the implication C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
C4 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events can occur after that initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. This matches the context statement ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" so C1 is true.
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. Same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens. Although C2 holds, event1 does not happen in the given scenario: event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after it, so event1 does not and cannot occur. Therefore C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
C4 says: if C1 holds then C3 holds. We have C1 true but C3 false, so the implication (C1 → C3) is false in this situation.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context: initially event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen. (The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 does not occur.)

2. Evaluate conditions in the initial state:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 did happen initially.
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not(C1). Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not(C2). Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

3. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" After event2 no further events can happen, so truth values do not change in any subsequent state; C3 remains false in the next state.

Therefore C4 is false.

You ask whether C4 is true or false given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
   - At the initial state S0, event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so in the following state S1, no events occur).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur).

2. Evaluate conditions at S0:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" At S0 event2 did happen, so C1 is false.
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1, so C2 is true at S0.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2, so C3 is false at S0.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — evaluate C3 at the next state S1.

3. Evaluate at the next state S1 (after event2, no events occur):
   - C1 at S1: event2 does not happen → true.
   - C2 at S1: ¬C1 → false.
   - C3 at S1: ¬C2 → true.

Thus C3 holds in the next state, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C3 is true in the state immediately after the initial state, given the context.

Step 2 — rewrite the conditions
- Let E2 mean “event2 happens (in the given state)”.
- C1 = not E2.
- C2 = not C1 = not(not E2) = E2.
- C3 = not C2 = not E2, so C3 is the same as C1 (i.e. “event2 does not happen”).

So C4 = “in the next state, not E2” (equivalently, “in the next state event2 does not happen”).

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate the next state
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state E2 is true).
- “After event2, no other events can happen” implies that in the next state no events occur; in particular, event2 does not occur in that next state (E2 is false in the next state).

Therefore C3 (not E2) is true in the next state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what is asked
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions and events
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen.
- The other context statements (after event2, no other events can happen; after event1, no other events can happen) only restrict further events but do not negate that event1 already happened.

Step 3 — evaluate the hypothesis conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 happens, C1 is True.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds → True and True → C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" → since C3 is True, C4 is False.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same literal).
- C2 = ""Event1 happens"".
- C3 = C1 and C2 = ""Event1 happens"".
- C4 = not C3 = ""Event1 does not happen"".
The question asks whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — use the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen (true).
- The other context sentences (""After event2, no other events can happen."" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."") do not contradict that event1 happened initially.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- C1 is true, C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- Therefore C4 (the negation of C3) is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold.""

Step 2 — understand each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: same as C1, so also ""Event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (both hold).
- C4: negation of C3 — ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 3 — use the context:
- The context states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""Event1 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — evaluate:
- C1 is true, C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4 (that C3 does not hold) is therefore false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Identify the hypothesis:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Interpret the context as a discrete timeline:
- Initially (time t0) event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state (so event2 at t1 if event1 at t0).
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state (so event1 at t2 if event2 at t1).
Thus the events alternate: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ...

Examine each condition at the initial time t0:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (event1 → event1), so C1 is true at every time, including t0.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 at t0 reduces to ""event2 at t0"", which is false (event2 does not occur at t0). So C2 is false at t0.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C2 is true at t1. At t1 event2 is true, and C1 holds, so C2 is true at t1. Therefore C3 is true at t0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C3 is true at t1, i.e. whether C2 is true at t2. At t2 event1 holds and event2 does not, so C2 is false at t2, so C3 is false at t1. Hence C4 is false at t0.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C4. C4 says: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We evaluate C4 at the initial state (the usual reading).

Step 2 — interpret the context as a timeline
- Initially (time 0): event1 happens.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → if event1 at time t, then event2 at time t+1.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → if event2 at time t, then event1 at time t+1.

So the timeline is:
- t0: event1
- t1: event2
- t2: event1
- t3: event2
... alternating forever.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the tautology event1 → event1, so C1 is true at every time (including t0).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This is true exactly at times when event2 holds (since C1 always holds). Thus C2 is true at t1, t3, ... and false at t0, t2, ...
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Evaluated at a time t, C3 means C2 is true at t+1. So:
  - At t0: C3 is true because C2 is true at t1.
  - At t1: C3 is false because C2 is false at t2 (t2 has event1, not event2).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Evaluated at t0, C4 asks whether C3 is true at t1. From the previous line, C3 at t1 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the setup.

Step 2 — understand the system
- Initial state s0: event1 happened.
- Rules: after event1, event2 must happen (so event2 at the next state); after event2, event1 must happen.
- So the states alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P) and thus true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This is true in a state exactly when event2 happens (since C1 always holds).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At s0, C3 is true iff C2 is true at s1. Since s1 has event2, C2 is true at s1, so C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" At s0, C4 is true iff C3 is true at s1. But at s1, C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state (s2)"". s2 has event1 not event2, so C2 is false at s2, hence C3 is false at s1. Therefore C4 is false at s0.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → since event1 happened, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen → once event2 happens, event1 must happen again (and so on).

So both event1 and event2 do occur (event1 initially, then event2, then event1 again, ...).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — True (both happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — False (negation of a true statement).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — True (negation of false).
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" — True AND True = True.

Final answer:
True
---
The hypothesis asks whether C4 is true or false.

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Initially, event1 happened, so C1 is true.
2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (¬C1). Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" (¬C2). As C2 is false, C3 is true.
4. C4 is ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" We already have C3 true. From the context, after event1 happens, event2 must happen; since event1 happened initially, event2 will happen. Thus Event2 is true and C3 is true, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify goal:
We must evaluate whether C4 (""Event2 happens and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 does happen).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 happened, event2 will happen).
- After event2, event1 must happen (cycles, but not needed beyond ensuring both occur).

Step 3 — evaluate C1:
C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens). Since event1 happened initially (and event2 will happen), C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = NOT(C1). Because C1 is true, C2 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C3:
C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" = NOT(C2). Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

Step 6 — evaluate C4:
C4 = (event2 happens) AND (C3 holds). Event2 does happen (from step 2) and C3 is true (step 5), so C4 is true.

True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So the initial state has no successor / no next state.)
- (The ""after event2 ..."" clause is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. Given the context, C1 is false in the initial state (event1 did happen).
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds. This is a logical tautology (either event1 happens or it does not), so C2 is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C3: C2 holds in the next state. This requires there to be a next state in which C2 is true.
  But there is no next state (after event1 no other events can happen), so ""C2 holds in the next state"" is false (the next-state formula fails when no successor exists).
- C4: C3 does not hold. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context, initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no successor state with further events.

2. C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false because event1 did happen initially.

3. C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true (the disjunction is true because event1 happens).

4. C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false, because there is no next state after event1 (no further events can occur), so C2 cannot be said to hold in a next state.

5. C4 (""C3 does not hold"") therefore is true.

So C4 is True.

Step 1 — what’s asked
The question asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in the given initial situation
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (so there is no next state after the initial one).
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (event1 did happen initially).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 happens, C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can follow event1), so the statement ""C2 holds in the next state"" is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. So in the next state (after the initial one) no events occur; in particular event2 does not happen in the next state.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — true (since C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" — true (C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — false (C3 is true).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially (in the current state) event2 happened.
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” So once event2 has occurred, there are no further events in subsequent states (i.e., nothing, including event2, can occur in the next state).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Given the context, no events can happen after event2, so event2 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is False.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” Since C1 is False, C2 is True.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens.” C2 holds (True), so C3 is True regardless of whether event2 happens in the next state.

Step 5 — evaluate C4:
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 is True, C4 is False.

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C4 is true or false.

Step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. So there is no successor state in which any event (including event2) can occur.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is false, because no events can occur after the initial event2.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is true, so C3 is true (the disjunction is true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must determine the truth of C4 given the context. C4 says: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 says: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 says: ""C1 always holds."" C1 says: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur later).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant unless event2 actually occurs).

Step 3 — examine C1
C1 requires that whenever event1 happens, event2 happens (at some time after or at the same time). But the context gives an actual situation where event1 did happen initially and, because of the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot occur after event1. There's no information that event2 also happened initially. Therefore in the actual run described by the context event1 occurs while event2 does not — so C1 is false.

Step 4 — propagate to C2, C3, C4
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is already false in the initial/actual situation.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false because C2 is false (there is no way for C2 to become true simply by shifting states).
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let s0 be the initial state: event1 is true at s0, event2 is false at s0.
- By ""after event1, no other events can happen"", every subsequent state s1, s2, ... has neither event1 nor event2 (both false).

Evaluate the conditions at s0 and later:

- C1 (""if event1 happens then event2 happens"") is false at s0 (event1 true, event2 false). For any later state si (i ≥ 1), C1 is true (antecedent false, so implication holds).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false at s0 because C1 fails at s0. But C2 is true at s1 and all later states because C1 holds in every state from s1 onward.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") at s0 asks whether C2 is true at s1 — it is — so C3 is true at s0. (And similarly true at later states.)
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") at s0 asks whether C3 is true at s1 — it is — so C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must evaluate C4 (""C3 does not hold"") given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context to evaluate events
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" implies event1 does (event2 → event1).
- Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" just ensures the alternation continues, but we already have at least one occurrence of each.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (event2 happened initially and event1 follows).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Given event2 → event1, any occurrence of event2 entails that both events occur, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is False, so ""C3 does not hold"" is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
You ask whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and the conditions
Context: initially event2 happens; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So event2 → event1, and event1 → event2, and event2 does occur initially.

Hypothesis conditions:
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens.
- C2: if event2 happens, then C1 holds.
- C3: C2 does not hold.
- C4: C3 does not hold (i.e., not(C3)).

Step 3 — reason through events and conditions
- From the context, event2 occurs (initially) and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" ensures event1 does happen. So both event2 and event1 happen; hence C1 is True.
- C2 states: if event2 happens then (event2 and event1 happen). Logically this is equivalent to ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" (since the antecedent already asserts event2). The context gives exactly that rule, so C2 is True.
- C3 says C2 does not hold; since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"", i.e. the negation of C3. Since C3 is False, C4 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After any event2, event1 must happen.
- After any event1, event2 must happen.
So both events occur (event2 initially, then event1, then event2, …).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the context both events do occur, so C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1, whenever event2 happens both event2 and event1 occur (so C1 holds). Thus C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3:
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we found C2 is true, so C3 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C4:
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, ""C3 does not hold"" is true. Therefore C4 is true.

- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds (so effectively the same as C1).
- C4: C3 does not hold (¬C3).

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Since event2 happened initially, the disjunction event1 ∨ event2 is true. So C1 is true. C2 is identical, so C2 is true.
- Therefore C3 (C1 ∧ C2) is true.
- C4 asserts ¬C3, but C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C3 will hold at some state (possibly the current one).

Step 2 — restate the context as a timeline
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By the given rule, s1 (the next state) must have event2.
- After event2 (i.e. from s1 onward) no other events can happen (so s1 has event2 and there are no further event occurrences after s1).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - At s0: true (s1 has event2).
  - At s1: false (there is no next state with event2; no further events happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds.""
  - This requires C1 to be true at every state. Since C1 is false at s1, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
  - Since C2 is false, C3 is true (already true at s0).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds.""
  - Because C3 is already true at s0, C4 is true (eventually includes the current state).

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context:
  - S0 (initial): event1 has happened.
  - S1: because after event1 event2 must happen, event2 happens in the next state.
  - S2 onward: after event2 no other events can happen (so no event2 in S2).

- Evaluate C1 (""event2 happens in the next state""):
  - At S0: true (event2 occurs in S1).
  - At S1: false (S2 has no events, so event2 does not occur in the next state).

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false, because C1 fails at S1.

- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore true (already true at S0).

- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true because C3 holds immediately (so it certainly holds eventually).

Hence C4 is True.

Goal: determine whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

1) Interpret the scenario:
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule: if event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.
- Rule: after event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

2) Evaluate the Cs now and over time:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (event1 happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- Can these truth values change later? No: because event1 already happened and no further events can occur, the facts that make C1 false (and thus C2 true, C3 false) cannot be changed by future events. Event2 cannot occur after event1, so no sequence will flip C1/C2/C3.

3) Therefore C3 will never become true, so ""C3 eventually holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- The question asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition with the context
- Context: Initially, event1 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false because event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Step 3 — temporal reasoning about C3 and C4
- C4 asserts that C3 eventually holds at some time. But C3 is currently false.
- Because event1 occurred initially and no events can occur after event1, the truth values of these propositions cannot change later. In particular, C3 cannot become true later.

Conclusion
- C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions now
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" The context says event1 happened initially, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" means C3 must become true at some future point.

Step 3 — consider possible changes over time
- The context also says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Event1 already happened initially, so no further events can occur to change the truth of C1/C2/C3.
- C2 (true) cannot become false, so C3 (not C2) cannot become true at any future time.

Conclusion
- C3 will never hold, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is False.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Final answer:

We are asked whether C4 is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: After event1, event2 must happen. This directly makes C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 holds, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Identify the goal
- C4 asserts: ""C3 always holds.""

Examine each condition with the context
- Context implies a strict alternation: initially event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen. So whenever event1 happens, event2 follows.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This follows directly from the context, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This contradicts C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C4 is (C2 holds) OR (C3 holds). We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, no events can occur in any future states).
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant because event1 cannot occur after event2 per the previous rule).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 / C3: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" The ""next state"" is a state after the initial state. But because event2 has already happened and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 and C3 are false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means in the next state the statement C1 is true (i.e., event1 would have to happen in the state after the next). But again, no events can happen after event2, so event1 cannot occur in any future state; C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C2 is false and C3 is false, so C4 (C2 OR C3) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret timeline and rules:
- Let t0 be the initial state. At t0, event2 happened (""Initially, event2 happened"").
- Rule: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — if event1 occurs at some time, event2 must occur afterward (interpreting as in the next state or at least after that point).
- Rule: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — once event2 has occurred at some time, no events can occur at any later times.

Step 2 — apply rules to the initial condition:
- Since event2 occurred at t0, no events can occur at t1 or any later time.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., event1 at t1) — impossible because no events can occur after t0 → C1 is False.
- C3 is the same as C1 → False.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" means that at t1, C1 is true (i.e., event1 happens at t2). But since no events can occur at t2 either, C1 is false at t1 → C2 is False.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" = False or False → False.

Final answer:
False
---
We reason relative to the initial state (where ""Initially, event2 happened"").

1. Interpretation:
- C1 and C3: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (identical).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = in two steps ahead, Event1 happens.
- C4: C2 or C3 = Event1 happens either in the next state or the state after that.

2. Use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 has already happened initially, no events can occur in any future state (including the next state and beyond).

3. Consequences:
- Event1 cannot happen in the next state → C1 and C3 are false.
- Event1 cannot happen in the state after the next → C2 is false.
- Therefore C4 = C2 or C3 is false.

Step 1 — what is asked:
We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions from the context:
- Context: event2 happened initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. Thus event2 has happened, and event1 will (and does) happen as required.

Step 3 — evaluate the Cs:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (event2 already happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" True (C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (C2 is true).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Although event1 happens, C3 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions C1–C3.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen (after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 also happens subsequently. So both events occur (event2 initially, then event1, then event2, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 already happened (and event1 happens too), so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is True, so the disjunction is True; hence C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C3 is False, so the conjunction is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
We must determine whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions. Final answer must be either ""True"" or ""False.""

Step 2 — examine the context and consequences
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 will (or does) happen sometime after the initial event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will happen again after event1. (The sequence alternates, but at minimum both events do occur.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given event2 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (an OR with a true disjunct is true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we found C2 is true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" We know event1 does happen, but C3 is false. So C4 is (true AND false) = false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify question
We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is True or False, given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context implies the actual event sequence is: event2 occurs initially, then event1 must occur, and after event1 nothing else can happen. So event1 does occur.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Claims C1 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: C2 ∧ C3.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- Because event1 does occur, the implication in C1 is true (and in fact P→P is always true). So C1 holds (true).
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 does hold, C2 is false.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — determine C4
C4 requires both C2 and C3 to be true. We have C2 = false and C3 = true, so their conjunction C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C4 is true.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" That is False AND True, which is False.

Therefore C4 is False. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does occur (after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal.
(So the actual sequence is event2 then event1, and event1 does happen.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 holds (True).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is False.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 holds (True).
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" That is False ∧ True = False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened (so at the start, event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (every occurrence of event1 is followed by an event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (every occurrence of event2 is followed by an event1).
These constraints produce an alternating sequence of occurrences (event1, then event2, then event1, ...), with gaps between instantaneous events.

Step 3 — examine C1–C4
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is true at the initial moment (event1 happened).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""at every time point,"" this would require that at every moment either event1 or event2 is occurring. That is false: events are instantaneous and there are times between occurrences when neither event is happening. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false (even though event1 does happen initially).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is already false, C4 cannot hold.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" We must decide if that is guaranteed by the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- Initially event1 happened (so at time t0: event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so sometime after any event1 there will be an event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so after any event2 there will be an event1).

Hypothesis pieces:
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens (holds at a time when either event is true).
- C2: C1 always holds (at every time, either event1 or event2 holds).
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens (i.e., globally C1 always holds, and at the current time event1 holds).
- C4: C3 always holds (so at every time: C2 holds and event1 holds — in particular event1 must hold at every time).

Step 3 — construct a concrete trace
From the context we can have an alternating trace:
t0: event1 (given)
t1: event2 (required after t0)
t2: event1 (required after t1)
t3: event2, ...
This satisfies the context.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 on that trace
- C2 holds on this trace: at every time either event1 or event2 holds (they alternate).
- C3 is true at times when event1 holds (t0, t2, ...), but false at times when event2 holds (t1, t3, ...).
- Therefore C3 is not true at every time, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context:
- Initially event1 occurs (call that time t0).
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur at some later time.
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur at some later time.
So starting from t0 with event1, the rules force an infinite alternation: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ….

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" At any event time in this alternating sequence, one of the two events occurs, so C1 is true at every event step.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Given the alternation, at every time-step one of the two events occurs, so C1 is indeed true at every time — C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 holds globally, but ""event1 happens"" is true only at the times when event1 occurs (t0, t2, t4, …), and false at times when event2 occurs (t1, t3, …). Thus C3 is true at event1 times and false at event2 times.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is not true at the times when event2 occurs, C3 is not true at all times.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let s0 be the initial state (where event2 happened), and s1 the next state.
- C1 = (event2 happens) ∨ (event1 happens). At s0 event2 happened, so C1 is true at s0.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds already at s0, C2 is true at s0.
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true at s0, C3 is false at s0.
- Now consider s1. By the context, after event2 no other events can happen, so at s1 neither event1 nor event2 occurs, hence C1 is false at s1 and will remain false. Therefore C2 is false at s1 (C1 does not eventually hold from s1). Thus C3 (¬C2) is true at s1.
- C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C3 is true at s1). As shown, C3 is true at s1.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — given context
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so there is no successor state reachable after the initial state — event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 cannot occur unless a later event2 follows; but since event2 already happened and is terminal, event1 cannot occur after the initial state).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is true in the initial state because event2 happened.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is already true immediately, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There are two reasons C4 is false:
  1. C3 is false in the initial state, so it cannot ""hold"" in any successor unless something changes.
  2. There is no next state (after event2 no further events/states), and under standard ""next"" semantics a next-state claim is false when no next state exists.

Conclusion
- C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (concise, stepwise):
- Given: initially event2 has happened; after event2 no further events can occur.
- C1 (event2 or event1) is true in the initial state (event2 occurred).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds now.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore false.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false, since C3 is false now and no future events can make it true.

Thus C4 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen. So both events do occur (event2 initially, then event1, then event2, …).
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens.
- C2: same as C1 (event1 happens or event2 happens).
- C3: event1 happens and C2 holds. Since C2 is identical to C1, C3 is equivalent to “event1 happens and (event1 or event2 happens)”, which just requires event1 happens (because the disjunction is true whenever an event happens).
- C4: C1 → C3, i.e. (event1 or event2) → event1 (given C2 ≡ C1).

Step 3 — trace the events
From the context: event2 happened initially, and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” forces event1 to happen. Thus event1 does happen (eventually). Therefore:
- C1 is true (because event2 happened).
- C2 is true (same as C1).
- C3 is true (event1 happens and C2 holds).

Step 4 — evaluate C4
An implication C1 → C3 is true whenever, under the context, whenever C1 holds then C3 holds. Here C1 holds and C3 also holds, so the implication is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 states: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether this implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur.
Thus the events alternate, so both event1 and event2 do occur (indeed infinitely often under these rules).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. Given both occur, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: event1 happens and C2 holds. event1 does happen and C2 is true, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
C4 is the implication ""if C1 then C3"". Since C1 is true and C3 is true, the implication is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So the timeline contains event2 (initial) and then event1, and thereafter they alternate; in particular event1 does occur.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the context, this is true (event2 already happened, and event1 will happen).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Since event1 does happen and C2 holds, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Because C1 is true and C3 is true in every timeline consistent with the context (event1 is guaranteed after the initial event2), the implication C1 → C3 holds.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C4 is True

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
   - Initially, event1 has happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no further events).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (redundant here because event2 never gets the chance if event1 already blocks further events).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
   - Since event1 has already happened and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" there cannot be any further events (including event2). So C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""
   - C1 is false (from step 2), although event1 does happen initially. Because C1 is false, the conjunction is false. So C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 always holds.""
   - C2 is already false in the initial state, so it does not hold always. C3 is false.

5. Evaluate C4: ""C3 always holds.""
   - C3 is false, so it cannot be always true. Therefore C4 is false.

Hence C4 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the initial state has event1 and there are no successor states where any event (including event2) can occur.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Because there is no next state after the initial state (no events can follow event1), C1 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" event1 does happen initially, but C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false in the initial state, C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so the initial state is one where event1 has just occurred).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred there are no subsequent events (no next-state events).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" also says event2 would also block further events, but that is irrelevant because event2 never occurs given the first rule and the initial condition.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (because event1 occurred and prevents any further events), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is false, so C2 is false (even though event1 did happen initially).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is already false at the initial state, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") can be true given the context constraints.

Step 2 — Simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to: Event2 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold → C2 = (not Event2).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state → in the next state, Event2 does not happen.
- C4: Event1 happens (now) and C3 holds → Event1 happens now AND in the next state Event2 does not happen.

Step 3 — Use the context rules
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- Rule: after Event1, Event2 must happen in the next state.
  That means whenever Event1 happens at some state, the immediately following state must have Event2.

Step 4 — Contradiction with C4
- C4 requires that Event1 happens now and that in the next state Event2 does NOT happen.
- That directly contradicts the rule ""after Event1, Event2 must happen in the next state.""
- Therefore C4 cannot be satisfied.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context rules:
  - Initially, event1 is true (state 0).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., in the next state after any state where event1 holds, event2 holds).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (symmetrically).
- Conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" ≡ event2 (in the current state).
  - C2: C1 does not hold ≡ ¬event2 (current state).
  - C3: C2 holds in the next state ≡ in the next state, ¬event2.
  - C4: event1 holds now and C3 holds ≡ event1 now AND (next state has ¬event2).

Step 3 — trace with the context
- Initially (state 0) event1 is true, so the left conjunct of C4 (event1 now) is satisfied.
- But the context requires that after event1, event2 must happen in the next state. Therefore in the next state (state 1) event2 must be true.
- C3 requires the next state to have ¬event2, which contradicts the context requirement that the next state has event2.

Conclusion
- C4 cannot be satisfied under the given context.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- The question asks whether C4 is true given the context and definitions of C1–C3. So we must check if there can be a state where C4 holds.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬Event2).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — the next state has ¬Event2.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" — current state has Event1 and the next state has ¬Event2.

Step 3 — use the context rules
- Initially Event1 happened.
- ""After Event1, Event2 must happen"" implies: whenever Event1 holds at a state, Event2 must hold in the next state.
- Therefore if Event1 holds now, the next state must have Event2 (not ¬Event2).

Step 4 — contradiction with C4
- C4 requires next state ¬Event2, but the context enforces next state Event2 whenever Event1 holds now.
- Thus C4 cannot be satisfied in any state where Event1 holds.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context, event2 did happen (initially), and then event1 happened; after event1 no further events occur.
- C1 and C2 both assert ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, these are false (event2 did happen).
- C3 is ""C1 and C2,"" so C3 is also false.
- C4 is the implication ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" The antecedent (""event2 happens"") is true in the context, while the consequent (C3) is false.
- An implication with a true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Therefore C4 is False.

- In the context event2 does happen, so the antecedent of C4 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The assumptions: initially event2 has already happened. Also, once event2 happens no other events can happen afterwards. (Likewise, after event1 nothing can happen, but that is irrelevant if event1 never occurs.)

2. C1 (""event1 happens and event2 happens""): event2 does happen (initially), but because event2 has happened and after it no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur later. There is no indication event1 happened before the initial moment, so event1 does not happen. Therefore C1 is false.

3. C2 (""event1 happens and C1 holds""): since C1 is false and event1 does not happen, C2 is false.

4. C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): C2 can never become true (event1 cannot occur), so C3 is false.

5. C4 (""C3 always holds""): C3 is false (does not hold at any time), so it is not the case that C3 always holds. Thus C4 is false.
---
We want to know whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — understand the Cs
- C1: event1 happens AND event2 happens.
- C2: event1 happens AND C1 holds. This is logically equivalent to event1 AND (event1 AND event2) → simply event1 AND event2. So C2 ≡ C1.
- C3: eventually C2 holds — i.e., at some time in the future (or now) both event1 and event2 occur.
- C4: C3 always holds — i.e., at every point in time it is true that eventually both events will occur.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, no further events may occur.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 happens, that also stops any later events.)

Because event2 happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any later time. There is no earlier time before the initial moment for event1 to have happened (the problem states event2 happened initially), so there is no way for both event1 and event2 to hold (unless you allow them to occur simultaneously at the initial moment). Under the standard reading that ""after event2 no other events can happen"" prevents any further occurrences and that event2 occurred initially alone, C1 (and therefore C2) cannot become true. Hence C3 (""eventually C2"") is false, and therefore C4 (""always C3"") is false.

(If one allowed the special alternative that event1 and event2 happened simultaneously at the initial moment, then C1–C4 could all hold. But with the usual interpretation given by the context, they do not.)

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has occurred at the start.
2. Context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That prevents any event (including event1) from happening after the initial event2.
3. Nothing in the context states event1 happened before the initial event2, so we cannot assume event1 happened. Given event2 occurred initially and blocks any subsequent events, event1 does not happen.
4. Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") is false (event1 does not happen).
5. If C1 is false, then C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false, C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false, and hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

So C4 is False."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: event1 has already happened initially. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time (it cannot occur after the initial event1, and there is no earlier time in the given model).

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" False, because although C1 holds, event2 does not happen.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is true (vacuously true) because C2 is false.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: event1 already happened initially. Also, once event1 has happened no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur after that (hence it cannot occur at all given the initial event1).
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens""): True (it already happened initially).
- C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens""): False, because event2 cannot happen.
- C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens""): True — an implication with a false antecedent is true (and in any case event1 already happened).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold""): False, since C3 does hold.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The context says event1 happened initially. Therefore C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur. So event2 does not happen, and C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is false.
3. C3 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (and independently event1 already happens anyway), so C3 is true.
4. C4 asserts that C3 does not hold. Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Step 1 — what’s asked:
C4 is the formula ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions in states:
- Context: initially event2 happened (call that state S0). After event2, event1 must happen, so in the next state S1 event1 occurs. After event1 no further events occur.
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Interpreted at S0, this is true (event1 has not happened yet).
- C2: same as C1, “Event1 does not happen.”
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — i.e. in S1, event1 does not happen. But in S1 event1 must happen (by the context), so C3 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
C4 is “If C1 then C3”. At S0 C1 is true, but C3 is false (since event1 happens in the next state). So the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 is the claim: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" (C1: Event1 does not happen; C3: C2 holds in the next state, and C2 is the same as C1.)

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one will have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in the initial state and the next state:
- In the initial state: event1 has not happened yet, so C1 (Event1 does not happen) is true.
- In the next state: because after event2 event1 must happen, the next state contains event1, so ""Event1 does not happen"" is false there. Thus C3 (that C2 holds in the next state) is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 is ""if C1 then C3"". In the initial state the antecedent C1 is true and the consequent C3 is false, so the implication is false.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — check the context vs. C1–C3
- Context: event1 happened (initially), then event2 must happen, and after event2 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" We have C2 = true and C3 = false, so the implication true → false is false.

Final answer:

We need to decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context: event1 happened initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen. So event1 did happen, and event2 did happen as well.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (event1 did happen).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This conditional has a false antecedent (C1), so it is true (vacuously true).
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Here C2 is true and C3 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened. (So event1 is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 happens.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Sequence ends.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: Event1 does not happen. This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. C2 is the implication (C1 → event2). Since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true (a conditional with a false antecedent is true in standard logic). So C2 is true.
- C3: Event1 does not happen. Same as C1, so C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
C4 is the implication (C2 → C3). We have C2 = true and C3 = false, so (true → false) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Given C1 ≡ ""Event1 happens"", C2 is the implication (Event1 happens) → (Event1 happens), which is tautologically true whenever evaluated.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — at some time C3 is true.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context guarantees event1 does occur (initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen). So C1 is true.
- Because C1 is (equivalent to) ""event1 happens"", the implication in C2 is true. Therefore C2 holds.
- C3 is the statement that C2 does not hold; since C2 holds, C3 is false.
- C3 being false does not later become true (C2 remains true), so ""eventually C3 holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step:

1. From the initial rules: event2 happens first, then event1 must happen, then event2 must happen, then event1, and so on. So event1 does occur (indeed infinitely often).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" and is true (event1 occurs).

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 implies event1 (they are equivalent), this implication is true.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 does hold, C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never holds, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- So starting from the initial event2, event1 will happen next, then event2, then event1, etc. Event1 does occur (indeed infinitely often).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given the context, C1 holds (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 already asserts event1 happens, the implication C1 → event1 is tautologically true (antecedent entails consequent). So C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But we just established C2 does hold, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is false and cannot become true (C2 is necessarily true), C3 does not eventually hold.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

- Timeline from the context:
  - t0 (initial): event1 happened.
  - By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get t1: event2 happens.
  - By ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we get t2: event1, then t3: event2, etc. So the system alternates: event1 at even times, event2 at odd times.

- Interpretations (natural reading):
  - C1 ""Event2 always happens"" = event2 holds at every state (global/always).
  - C2 ""C1 does not hold"" = C1 is false.
  - C3 ""C2 holds in the next state"" = at the next state C1 is false.
  - C4 ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" = if in the next state C1 is false, then event2 happens (in the current state).

- Evaluate at t0:
  - C1 is false (event2 does not hold at every state — e.g. t0 has event1, not event2), so C2 is true at t0.
  - At t1 the same argument applies, so C2 is also true at t1; therefore C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true at t0.
  - The antecedent of C4 (C3) is true at t0, but the consequent ""event2 happens"" is false at t0 (event1 happened at t0). So the implication is falsified at t0.

Since we have a concrete state (t0) where C3 is true and event2 does not happen, C4 is false.
---
Reasoning:

- Start state s0: event1 happened.
- From the context, events must alternate: s0 (event1) → s1 (event2) → s2 (event1) → ...
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false (there are states with event1 and no event2).
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true at s0 because in s1 C2 is true.
- C4 is the claim: if C3 holds (now), then event2 happens (now). At s0 C3 is true but event2 does not happen (s0 had event1). So the implication fails.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after an event1 is event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so events alternate: ... event1, event2, event1, event2, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as at every state/time point. This is false, because event2 occurs only at every other state (events alternate).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is a global fact (C1 is false), so C2 also holds in the next state. Thus C3 is true in the current state.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" We evaluate this implication at the current state. We have C3 true now, but at the current (initial) state event1 happened, not event2. So the antecedent is true while the consequent (""event2 happens"" now) is false — therefore the implication is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So starting from the initial event1, event2 must occur later, then event1 again, etc. (an alternating infinite sequence).
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""

- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"" — i.e. ""If event1 happens, then Event2 never happens.""

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
- Since event1 happened initially and the rules require that after event1 event2 must happen, Event2 does happen. So C1 holds and C2 (eventually Event2 happens) is true.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"" / Event2 never happens) is false.
- C4 asserts that whenever event1 happens, C3 holds. But event1 does happen (initially) while C3 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also: after event1, event2 must happen; and after event2, event1 must happen. So an occurrence of one forces the other to occur later (and since event1 already happened, event2 must occur eventually, then event1 again, etc.).
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (a tautology/redundant).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" => ""Eventually event2 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" => ""It is not the case that eventually event2 happens.""
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"" => ""If event1 happens, then it is not the case that eventually event2 happens.""

Step 3 — trace the events and evaluate
Because event1 happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" applies, event2 will eventually occur. Thus C2 is true (event2 does eventually happen). Therefore C3 (the negation of C2) is false.

C4 is an implication whose antecedent (event1 happens) is true in the context, but whose consequent (C3) is false. An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Final answer
False

Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C4 = ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" We must evaluate whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So starting from the initial event1, event2 must occur, then event1 must occur again, and so on (an infinite alternation). Thus event2 does occur (in fact infinitely often).
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — effectively: event2 happens. Given the context, this is true (event2 does occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since event2 does occur, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — this is false, because C2 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.
2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1 = ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ⇒ simply ""Event1 happens"".
   - C2 is the same ⇒ ""Event1 happens"".
   - C3 = C1 and C2 ⇒ ""Event1 happens"".
   - C4 = ""C3 always holds"" ⇒ ""Event1 always holds (at all times)"".
3. From the context:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   Therefore, since event2 already happened initially and no events can occur afterward, event1 cannot occur at any time.
4. Because event1 does not (and cannot) hold, C3 does not hold, and certainly it does not hold always.

Thus C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 asserts ""C3 always holds."" We must decide if that statement is true given the context.

Step 2 — decode the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""Event1 happens"" (same).
- C3: C1 and C2, so C3 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: ""Always C3"" ≡ ""At all times (in the execution) Event1 happens"".

Step 3 — use the context to trace possibilities
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore no event (including event1) can ever occur after that initial event2.
- So event1 does not occur at any point in the execution (it cannot happen after the initial event2, and there is no indication it happened before the initial moment).

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 and C2 are false (event1 does not happen).
- Hence C3 is false.
- Therefore ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the statement ""Event1 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2 is the same: ""Event1 happens"".
- C3 is ""C1 and C2"", i.e. still just ""Event1 happens"".
- C4 is ""C3 always holds"", i.e. ""Event1 always happens"" (true at every point).

Examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Reasoning:
- Nothing in the context asserts that event1 ever happens.
- Because event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false (event1 does not happen), so C3 is false.
- Since C3 is not true, it cannot ""always hold"".

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 is the statement ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 will happen (sometime after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (but that doesn't prevent event1 from happening once it is required).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" C1 holds, and in fact event1 will also happen, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Both disjuncts are true (event1 does happen and C2 holds), so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C4 says ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C3 is false given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions using the context
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2, event1 must happen. (And after event1 no other events can happen.)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True, because C1 holds.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" True, because C2 holds (and in fact event1 will also happen after event2).

Step 3 — conclude about C4
C4 = ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 holds, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

The hypothesis asks whether C4 (which is ""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: event2 has already happened initially, and after event2, event1 must happen. So event2 does occur (now) and event1 will occur (later).
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true (it already happened).
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true because C1 holds.
- C3 (""Event1 happens or C2 holds"") is true because C2 holds.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is therefore false.

We are asked whether C4 is true.

1) C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true.

2) C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and rules:
- Initially, event1 has happened (so at time 0 event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. whenever event1 occurs, some later time has event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, some later time has event1).

Step 3 — examine C1–C4:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true at time 0 because event1 already occurred initially; and due to the mutual requirements the events must alternate, so event1 in fact occurs infinitely often (so C1 holds at all times).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial time (and indeed at all times), there certainly exists a time at which C1 holds — so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" By the same reasoning (C2 holds already and continues to hold), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" We have established C3 holds, and from ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and the initial event1 we infer that event2 does happen (at least once, and then events alternate). Thus event2 happens, so both conjuncts of C4 are satisfied.

Conclusion:
- C4 is True.
---
True

Reasoning, step by step:

1. Initially event1 has happened.  
2. From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" there must be some later event2.  
3. From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" there must be another event1 later. Together these force an infinite alternation: event1 (initial), then event2, then event1, then event2, ...  
4. C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true (event1 occurs initially and again infinitely often).  
5. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 holds now and will continue to hold.  
6. C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true for the same reason.  
7. C3 holds at all times, and event2 does occur (infinitely often). Therefore there are times at which both C3 holds and event2 happens, so C4 is true.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context rules
- Initially event1 happened (so there is at least one occurrence of event1 at the initial time).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur at some (possibly later) time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur at some (possibly later) time.
Thus starting from the initial event1, the rules force event2 to occur later, then event1 again, and so on (an infinite alternation is required).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True, since C1 already holds now (so it certainly holds at some time).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True for the same reason (C2 holds now).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 holds, and by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (and event1 did happen initially), event2 will indeed occur. Therefore both conjuncts are true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 occurred (it happened at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (but because event2 would have to occur before event1, and event1 is terminal, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This would require event1 to hold at all times. We only know event1 happened initially and no further events occur afterward; that does not imply event1 occurs at every time instant. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event1 did happen initially).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is already false, so it cannot always hold. Thus C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, the statement ""C3 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened the execution is terminal (no further events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened and prevents further events), so that requirement is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — evaluate the claims
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the initial event1 and no possibility of further events that could prevent it, event1 does happen in every execution → C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is true and event1 did happen, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because the system is stuck after event1 (no change), the fact C2 is true persists — C2 holds now and at all future times → C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts the conclusion that C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Final question: Is C4 true or false?

Answer: True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- We are asked about C4 (""C3 does not hold"").
- Look at the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the only event that ever occurs is that single initial occurrence of event1.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") would mean event1 holds at every time point. That is false: event1 occurs at the initial moment but does not occur at subsequent times (there are no further events), so it is not true ""always.""
- C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is therefore false because C1 is false (the conjunct C1 fails), even though event1 does happen initially.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is already false.
- C4 is the negation of C3 (""C3 does not hold""), so C4 is true.

Therefore C4 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds.""

Step 2 — understand the context and events:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen at any time.

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just ""Event1 happens."" Given the context, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is true (since C1 is false).
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 = (C2 → C3) = (true → false), which is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- C4 is the conditional “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” We must determine whether that conditional is true given the context.

Step 2 — Simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just ""Event1 happens."" (redundant disjunction)
- C3 is identical to C1, so C3 is also ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 3 — Use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur. Therefore Event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2, C3, and C4
- Event1 does not happen ⇒ C2 is true.
- Event1 does not happen ⇒ C3 is false.
- C4 is the implication (C2 → C3). With C2 true and C3 false, the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C4 is the statement: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds.""

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens.""
- C3 is identical to C1, so C3 = ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore ""Event1 does not happen.""

So C4 is the implication: (Event1 does not happen) → (Event1 happens).

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate event1
- Context says: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C2 (Event1 does not happen) is true.
- C3 (Event1 happens) is false.
- An implication true → false is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
C4 is the claim ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether that claim is true or false given the event constraints.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially (state S0), event1 happened.
- After event1 (so in S1), event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (subsequent states have no events).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At S0 this is false (event1 did happen). At any later state (S1, S2, ...) this is true because event1 only happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Evaluate at S0: in S1 event1 does not happen, so C2 is true at S0. Evaluate at S1: in S2 event1 does not happen, so C2 is true at S1. And similarly for every subsequent state (event1 never reoccurs), so C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Because C3 is true, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 says ""C3 does not hold."" We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately following the current one, event1 does not happen)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e., at every state, C1 holds in the next state)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (the negation of C3)

Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context
- State 0 (initial): event1 happened (given).
- After event1, event2 must happen → State 1: event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen → State 2, State 3, ...: no events occur.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions in those states
- C1 at State 0: false (event1 happened in State 0).
- C2 at State 0: checks whether C1 holds in State 1. In State 1 event1 does not happen, so C1 is true in State 1 → C2 is true at State 0.
- C2 at State 1: checks whether C1 holds in State 2. State 2 has no events, so event1 does not happen there → C2 is true at State 1.
- For every subsequent state (State 2 onward), their next state also has no events, so C1 holds in each next state → C2 is true at every state.
- Therefore C2 holds in all states, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.

Step 5 — conclude about C4
- C4 says ""C3 does not hold."" But we found C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: S0 (initial) has event1. After that S1 must have event2. After S1, no further events occur (S2, S3, ... have no events).

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false in S0 (because event1 happens initially). That doesn't prevent C1 from being true in later states.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At S0 the next state S1 has event2 but not event1, so C1 is true in S1. At S1 the next state S2 has no events, so C1 is true in S2. So C2 is true in every state we examine.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since in every state the next state has no event1 (event1 only happened in S0), C2 does hold in every state, so C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of a true statement, so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- Initially (call it state S0) event2 has happened.
- The rules require that immediately after event2, event1 must happen. So in the next state (call it S1) event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen; therefore S1 contains event1 and there is no later state where any event (including event2) occurs.
- C1 and C2 both assert ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., event2 occurs in S1). But S1 contains event1, not event2, so C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — since C1 and C2 are false, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is false in the actual next state, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — What is being asked
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 and C2, so effectively ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C4: C3 holds in every state (globally/always).

Step 3 — Trace the events from the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the current/initial state event2 has occurred).
- The rule says after event2, event1 must happen — so in the next state event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 4 — Evaluate C3 and C4
- In the initial state, the next state contains event1, not event2. So C1 (and thus C3) is false at the initial state.
- Since C3 is not true at the initial state, it is not true ""always."" Therefore C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context says: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1 and C2 both assert ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since event2 already happened initially, the required next state after that must be event1 (by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen""). Thus event2 does not happen in the next state, so C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 is C1 and C2, so C3 is false.
- C4 says C3 always holds. Since C3 is already false in the relevant next state, C4 cannot be true.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 is always true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is true at all times (regardless of whether event2 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 always holds, C3 is always false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether C3 becomes true at some future time.

Step 3 — trace event sequence (context)
- The context gives an infinite alternation event2, event1, event2, ... starting from an initial event2. That makes event2 occur repeatedly, but it does not change that C1 is a tautology and hence C2 remains always true.

Step 4 — conclude
- C3 is never true (C2 never fails), so ""C3 eventually holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the statements
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (an implication with identical antecedent and consequent) — it is always true at any time.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is always true (the disjunction is true regardless of event2).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" That asserts C2 is false; but we just saw C2 is always true, so C3 is never true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether at some future time C3 becomes true.

Step 2 — use the context
- The context (event2 occurs initially, and events alternate so event2 occurs repeatedly) only strengthens that event2 happens at many times, so C2 would be true from the event2 disjunct as well; it cannot make C2 false.

Conclusion
- C3 can never be true, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p) and therefore holds (is true) whenever evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true (always), the disjunction C2 is true (always).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is true, C3 is false (and remains false as long as C2 stays true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That asks whether C3 will be true at some future time.

Step 3 — trace with the context
The context (event2 initially, then event1, then event2, etc.) only ensures event2 occurs repeatedly, but it does not change that C1 is a tautology and so C2 stays true at all times. Therefore C3 never becomes true.

Conclusion
C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true.

2. C2 says ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" That is: event2 → (event2 eventually happens). This is always true (if event2 occurs then it certainly occurs eventually; and if it doesn't occur the implication is vacuously true). So C2 is true.

3. C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

4. C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 is false (and not rescued by any state change), C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does eventually happen — C1 is true.

2. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is already true, so the implication in C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent). Thus C2 holds.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 holds, C3 is false.

4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 is false, it cannot hold in the next state, so C4 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must determine whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the scenario:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from the initial state, event2 is guaranteed to occur at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the scenario, this is true in the initial state (event2 is guaranteed after event1).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is true: C1 already holds, and more generally if event2 happens then certainly ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (either it happens now or later). So C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 holds, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false (both now and in the next state, because the requirements ensuring C1 and thus C2 continue to hold), so C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the initial state has event2 and is terminal (no next state).
- Also after event1 no other events can happen, i.e. event1 would also be terminal if it occurred, but it does not occur initially.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): false, because in the initial (and only) state event1 did not happen.
- C2 (""C1 always holds""): since C1 is false at the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): there are no future states (the initial state is terminal), so C2 will never become true — C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state""): there is no next state, and C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step by step):

- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never occurs (there is no state in which event1 holds).
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because event1 does not occur.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false (it simply strengthens C1 and cannot become true if C1 is false).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false because there is no future state in which C2 becomes true.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false for the same reason—C3 does not hold in the next state (indeed it never holds).

Thus C4 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no further events can occur — so the run stops with event2 and there is no way to make event1 occur later.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because event1 does not occur in the initial/only run.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false (C1 is already false).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false because C2 is never true in any future state (no future events can change that).
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false (there is no next state where C3 could hold, and C3 is false anyway).

Therefore C4 is False."

Step 1 — timeline from the context:
- t0 (initial): event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so at t1 event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from t2 onward no events occur.

Step 2 — evaluate C1 (event1 → event2) at each time:
- t0: event1 is false, so C1 is true (implication vacuously true).
- t1: event1 true and event2 false, so C1 is false.
- t2 and later: neither event1 nor event2 occurs, so event1 is false and C1 is true.

Step 3 — propagate the temporal conditions:
- C2 (""eventually C1"") at t2 is true because C1 already holds at t2.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") at t1 is true because at t2 C2 holds.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") at t0 is true because at t1 C3 holds.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context and conditions
- Context: event1 happened initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen. So event1 did occur and therefore event2 does occur.
- C1 and C2 are contradictory (C1: event1 always happens; C2: C1 does not hold).
- C3 says: if event1 happens, then C2 holds. Since event1 did happen, C3 (if true) would imply C2 holds; but whether C3 itself is true is not required to evaluate C4.
- C4 is the conditional: C3 → (event2 happens).

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- From the context, event2 does happen (it must follow the initial event1).
- A conditional ""If C3 then event2"" is true whenever the consequent (event2) is true, regardless of C3's truth value.

Conclusion
- C4 is True.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 did happen, event2 will happen).
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" The context only says event1 happened initially, not that it always happens; therefore C1 does not hold (C1 is false).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 did happen, and C2 is true, so the implication C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" We have established C3 holds, and from the context (event1 happened ⇒ event2 must happen) event2 does indeed happen. Thus the conditional in C4 is satisfied.

We are asked whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

- C2 (""C1 does not hold""): since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds""): event1 does happen in the context, and C2 is true, so the implication C3 is true.

Question: Is C4 true or false?

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context:
   - event2 happened initially.
   - After event2, no other events can happen, so no event can occur at any later time.
   - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" does not force event1 to have occurred; it only constrains what would follow if event1 happened.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event2 happens). Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
   - C2 = C1 OR event2. Given C1 is true (and event2 is true), C2 is true.
   - C3 = eventually C2 holds. C2 already holds at the initial time, so C3 is true.
   - C4 = (event1 happens) AND C3. C3 is true, but event1 does not happen: event2 already occurred initially and no further events can occur, so event1 cannot occur at any time.

3. Conclusion:
   - Because event1 does not happen, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine each condition given the context
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. Also, if event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event2 did happen initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" C1 already holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 holds now, so it certainly holds at some time (immediately), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" We have C3 true, but does Event1 happen?

Step 3 — trace and reason about event sequences
Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur after that initial event2. There is no indication event1 happened before that initial event2, so event1 does not happen in the scenario. Therefore the conjunct ""Event1 happens"" in C4 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 requires both parts true; since Event1 does not happen, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — that is ""If Event1 happens, then Event1 happens"".
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — negation of C3.

Step 3 — use the context:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 does happen, so C1 is true and C2 is true.
- Therefore C3 (the implication C1 → C2) is true (true antecedent and true consequent, and in any case the implication is trivially true because antecedent and consequent are the same statement).

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C3 holds, so ""C3 does not hold"" (C4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
The question asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just ""Event1 happens"" (repetition doesn't change it).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — this is ""If (Event1 happens) then (Event1 happens)"", i.e. P → P for P = ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — claims that the implication in C3 is false.

Step 3 — Use the context / trace events
- Context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""Event1 happens"" is true.
- Given that, C1 is true and C2 is true.
- C3, being ""if Event1 then Event1"", is true (a proposition implies itself). More generally, P → P is always true, and in this case the antecedent is actually true so the implication certainly holds.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C4
C4 asserts that C3 does not hold, but we have C3 holding. Therefore C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: same as C1, so also ""Event1 happens.""
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — i.e. ""If Event1 happens, then Event1 happens"" (an implication).
- C4: the negation of C3.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 does happen. Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 and C4
- C3 (""if C1 then C2"") is true: the antecedent C1 is true and the consequent C2 is true (and the implication is therefore true).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is the negation of a true statement, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is ""not (event2 happens).""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means at some state now or in the future, not(event2 happens) is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" means in the state immediately after the current one, C3 is true.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- After event2, no other events can happen — the initial state is terminal (no next state and no change that could make C2 true later).

Step 3 — evaluate
- Since C1 is true initially, C2 is false now.
- There are no future states where C2 could become true, so C3 (""eventually C2"") is false.
- Therefore C3 does not hold in any next state; moreover there is no next state at all. So C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is just ""event2 happens"". The context says event2 happened initially, so C1 is true initially.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1. Since C1 is true initially, C2 is false initially.
- The context also says that after event2 no other events can happen. That means nothing in the future will make C1 false (and thus C2 true). Therefore C2 never becomes true, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"". Because C3 is false (and there are no events to change that), C4 is false.

Hence C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (Also ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" but event1 never happened in the initial context.)
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
  Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1. Because C1 is true, C2 is false (now and, given the context, cannot become true later).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — requires that at some future state C2 becomes true. But C2 is the negation of C1, and C1 is already true and cannot be invalidated (no further events/change after event2), so C2 will never hold. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C4 is the claim ""Event1 happens and C3 holds.""

Step 2 — interpret the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true (C1 true).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus no event can occur after that initial event1, so event2 cannot occur at any time.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant for creating event2, but would force event1 if event2 happened.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens""): True (it already happened).
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds""): False, because event2 cannot happen (so the conjunction is false), even though C1 holds.
- C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds""): This is an implication whose antecedent is true (event1 did happen) but whose consequent C2 is false, so the implication is false.
- C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds""): Conjunction of true (event1) and false (C3) → false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has already happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred (and it did initially), no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied if event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" False, because event2 cannot happen after the initial event1 (and there is no earlier time for it to happen), so event2 does not happen; hence C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C2 is false, so the implication is false; C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C4 (""Event1 happens and C3 holds"") is true given the context rules.

Step 2 — restate the context rules
1. Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true from the start.)
2. After event1, no other events can happen. (No event can occur at any later time once event1 has happened.)
3. After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because event1 is true initially.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" C1 holds, but can event2 happen? No — because event1 has already happened initially and rule (2) forbids any events after event1. Event2 cannot have happened before the initial event1, so event2 cannot occur at all. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, so this implication requires C2 to hold; but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Although event1 happens, C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C4 asserts: C1 holds now AND C3 holds (i.e., C2 holds in the next state).
- So we must check whether C1 is true now and whether C2 will be true in the next state, given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions and context
- Context gives a global alternation rule: after event1 occurs, event2 must occur; after event2 occurs, event1 must occur. That enforces a perpetual alternation of event1 and event2.
- C1 and C2 are the same formula: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" The context directly entails that implication whenever event1 happens.
- C3 says that C2 (that implication) holds in the next state. Because the alternation rule is uniform, the implication remains true in every state.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- s0 (initial): event1 happened (given).
- By the rule, s1: event2 happens.
- By the rule again, s2: event1 happens, and so on.
- At each state the implication ""if event1 then event2"" is valid (either vacuously when event1 is false, or by the rule when event1 is true).

Conclusion
- C1 is true now, and C2 holds in the next state (so C3 is true). Therefore C4 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C1 holds and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and conditions
- Context: initially event1 occurs (call that state S0). After event1, event2 must happen (so at S1 event2). After event2, event1 must happen (so at S2 event1), and so on — the events alternate forever.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (a conditional that holds whenever event1 occurs).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That asserts the same conditional is true in the state following the current one.
- C4: C1 ∧ C3.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition on the timeline
- C1 is true because the context explicitly enforces that whenever event1 happens, event2 follows.
- C2 is the same as C1, so it is true.
- C3: in the next state (S1) the conditional C2 still holds. Either because the same global rule applies at every state, or vacuously (if event1 does not occur in S1 the implication is still true). So C3 is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's being asked
- C4 is the statement ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and set a timeline
- Initially (call this state 0) event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen (so at state 1).
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen (so at state 2), and so on.
- So the events alternate forever: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At state0 this is true because event1 occurs at state1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means at state0, C2 asserts that at state1, C1 is true. But C1 at state1 means ""event1 happens at state2."" At state2 we have event2, so C1 is false at state1. Therefore C2 is false at state0.
  More generally, C2 at state n is true iff event1 occurs at state n+2. Since event1 occurs at odd indices, C2 is true exactly at odd n and false at even n (it alternates).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That would require C2 to be true at every future state. But C2 alternates true/false, so it is never true at all future states; C3 is false at every state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That asks whether there exists some future state from which C2 holds always. Because C2 forever alternates, there is no such state. So C3 never becomes true at any future point.

Conclusion
- C4 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context we get a forced alternation starting with event2: time 0 = event2, time 1 = event1, time 2 = event2, time 3 = event1, ... and so on forever.

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state (time 0), the next state (time 1) indeed has event1, so C1 is true at time 0.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether C1 is true at time 1. That would require event1 at time 2. But time 2 = event2, so C1 is false at time 1; hence C2 is false at time 0.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false at the next state, C2 does not hold always; C3 is false.

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That would require reaching some future state from which C2 holds at all subsequent states. But the system forever alternates event1 and event2, so there is no point from which C2 holds at every future state. Therefore C3 never becomes true, so C4 is false.

Conclusion: C4 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

1. What is being asked: C4 says ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e., there exists some future state from which C2 always holds.

2. Interpret the conditions temporally:
   - Initially (time 0): event2 happened.
   - Rule: after event2 occurs, event1 must happen next; after event1 occurs, event2 must happen next. So the sequence is an infinite alternation:
     time 0: event2, time 1: event1, time 2: event2, time 3: event1, ...

3. Evaluate C1–C3 on this timeline (Ci_t means Ci at time t):
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" → C1_t is true iff event1 occurs at t+1.
     So C1_0 = true (event1 at time1), C1_1 = false (time2 is event2), and C1 alternates true/false.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" → C2_t = C1_{t+1}, i.e. event1 at t+2. Hence C2 alternates as well (true at t=1,3,5,...; false at t=0,2,4,...).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" at some time t means C2 is true at every future time ≥ t. Because C2 keeps alternating true/false forever, there is no time from which C2 is true at all future times. So C3 is false at every state.

4. Therefore C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false: there is no future state where C3 becomes true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context restated
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no further events / no transitions).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant if event1 never occurs).

2. Interpret the Ci
- C1: “Event1 happens” (the duplicate “and event1 happens” just repeats it).
- C2: “C1 always holds” (C1 is true in every state).
- C3: “Event1 happens and C2 holds” (so requires event1 to occur and that C1 is always true).
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.”

3. Key observations from the context
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, there can be no occurrence of event1 at any time.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 does not happen).
- Consequently C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.
- Hence C3 (conjunction of event1 happens and C2) is false.
- Finally, C4 states that C3 holds in the next state; since there are no further states after the initial (no events can occur after event2), there is no next state in which C3 could hold, and in any case C3 is false now, so C4 is false.

Conclusion: False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened (so the initial state has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen → once event2 has occurred, event1 can never occur in any later state.
- After event1, event2 must happen → irrelevant because event1 never occurs here (see previous point).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this requires event1 to hold (at the considered state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 must be true in every state.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" — requires event1 now and that C1 holds globally.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C3 must be true in the successor state.

Step 4 — reason about events and the conditions
- Since the initial state already has event2 and no events can occur after event2, event1 never occurs in any state.
- Therefore C1 is false in every state (because it requires event1).
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Then C3 is false (it requires event1 and C2).
- Therefore C3 cannot hold in any next state, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First, what the hypothesis asks: whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") can be true given the context.

Examine the conditions:

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (so C1 is true in a state iff event1 happens there).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — means C1 is true in every state (i.e., event1 happens in every state).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" — requires that event1 happens in the current state and event1 happens in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — requires that in the next state event1 happens and event1 holds in all states.

Use the context:

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Because event2 happened initially, no event1 can occur at any later time (there are no opportunities for events after event2).
- Therefore event1 never happens in any state.

Consequences:

- C1 is false (event1 never happens).
- C2 is false (C1 does not hold always).
- C3 is false (it requires event1 now and C2).
- Thus C3 cannot hold in any next state, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to Event1 (i.e. event1 is true).
- C2: same, simplifies to Event1.
- C3: Event2 happens and C2 holds → Event2 ∧ Event1.
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds → Event1 ∧ (Event2 ∧ Event1) → Event1 ∧ Event2.

So C4 is true exactly when both event1 and event2 happen.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate event occurrences
- Initially, event1 happened → Event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → once event1 has occurred (which is initially), no event2 can occur after that.
- Because event1 already happened initially, there is no time left for event2 to occur; therefore Event2 is false (it does not happen).
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 does not occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event1 is true but Event2 is false, so Event1 ∧ Event2 is false.
Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the conditions:
- C1 = (event1) ∨ (event1) which is equivalent to “event1 happens.”
- C2 is the same, so C2 ≡ “event1 happens.”
- C3 = event2 happens AND C2, so C3 ≡ (event2 happens) ∧ (event1 happens).
- C4 = C1 AND C3, so C4 ≡ (event1 happens) ∧ ((event2 happens) ∧ (event1 happens)) ≡ (event1 happens) ∧ (event2 happens).

Step 2 — apply the context:
- “Initially, event1 happened.” So there is an occurrence of event1 at the start.
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur afterwards, so no occurrence of event2 can happen after that initial event1.
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” For event2 to occur, there would have to be a subsequent event1 after it. But because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after that, there is no way for event2 to occur (it cannot be before the initial event1), and even if it did, the required event1-after-event2 cannot occur.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Event2 cannot happen under the given constraints, so “event2 happens” is false. Therefore C3 is false, and thus C4 (which requires event2) is false.

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C4 holds.

1. C1 is ""event1 or event1"", which is equivalent to ""event1"". Since event1 happened initially, C1 is True.
2. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is True.
3. C3 is ""event2 and C2"", which reduces to ""event2"" (since C2 is True). But the context says: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen — so event2 cannot occur. Therefore C3 is False.
4. C4 is ""C1 and C3"". With C1 True and C3 False, C4 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context facts:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events can ever occur.)
   - After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here since event2 does not occur.)

2. Consequences for C1 and C2:
   - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 has already happened and no further events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any future time. So C1 is false.
   - C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also false.

3. Consequences for C3 and C4:
   - C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — since both C1 and C2 are false, C3 is false.
   - C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" — there is no future point at which C3 becomes true (nothing changes after the initial event), so C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C4 says: ""C3 eventually holds.""
- C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds.""
- C1 and C2 are both ""Event2 eventually happens."" So C3 is equivalent to ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events can ever occur.
- (The clause ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never gets the chance to occur.)

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Because event1 has already happened and prevents any further events, event2 never happens.
- Therefore ""Event2 eventually happens"" is false (C1 and C2 are false), so C3 is false at all times.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 requires that C3 becomes true at some future time. But C3 is never true (event2 never occurs), so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify goal:
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is already false and no events (hence no changes) can occur after the initial event1, C3 can never become true later. So C4 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- The question asks whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 happens.
- C2: same as C1 ≡ Event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ ""Event1 eventually holds"" (i.e. Event1 will occur at some future point).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" ≡ ""Event1 happens now OR Event1 will eventually happen.""

Step 3 — apply the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once that initial event2 occurred, no event1 can happen now or in the future.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" does not enable event1 to occur (it only constrains what must follow if event1 occurs). Given event2 already occurred and prevents any further events, there is no way for event1 to occur either before or after in a way consistent with the timing constraints.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event1 does not hold now and will not hold eventually, so both C1 and C3 are false, hence C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C4 is true or false.

1. Identify the question
- C4 = C1 holds or C3 holds. We must evaluate whether C4 is true given the context.

2. Translate the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just Event1 happens (a tautological repetition).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 = Event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = eventually Event1 happens.
- C4: Event1 happens (now) or eventually Event1 happens.

3. Reason about possible event sequences
- Since event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no events (including event1) can occur now or in the future.
- Therefore Event1 does not hold now and will not hold later.

4. Evaluate the Cs
- C1 (Event1 happens) is false.
- C2 is false.
- C3 (eventually Event1 happens) is false.
- C4 = C1 or C3 = false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
You are asking whether C4 is true given the context. C4 is ""C1 holds or C3 holds.""

Step-by-step:

- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.

- Simplify the conditions:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1 happens.
  - C2: same ≡ event1 happens.
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ event1 eventually happens.
  - C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" ≡ event1 happens now (or at all) OR event1 eventually happens — in short, event1 happens at some time.

- Reasoning with the context:
  - event2 has already happened initially.
  - Because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur now or in the future.
  - Therefore event1 does not happen, C1 and C2 are false, and C3 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.

Since both disjuncts of C4 are false, C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
1) The question: is C4 True or False?

2) From the context: event2 happens initially; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen. So the actual sequence is event2 then event1 (both occur), then stop.

3) Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — true (both happen).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — true, because event1 does happen and C1 is true (so the implication holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — false, because C2 does hold.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — false, since C3 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
C4 is ""C3 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the context (event sequence)
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus the actual sequence is: event2 happens, then event1 happens, then nothing else.

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C3 under that sequence
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Both happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does happen and C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" But C3 is false (it does not hold), so C4 cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: event2 happens initially, then event1 must happen, and after event1 no further events occur. So both event2 and event1 do occur (event1 occurs after event2).

- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given both happen, C1 is true.

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event1 does happen and C1 is true, the implication in C2 is true. So C2 holds.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C4 says:
- C4 = ""always C3"", and C3 = C1 and C2. C1 and C2 both assert the same thing: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C4 asserts that at every state, Event1 happens in the next state.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- ""After Event2, no other events can happen."" Since Event2 has already happened initially, no events can occur in any subsequent state.
- Therefore Event1 cannot happen in the next state (or any later state).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (Event1 happens in the next state) is false at the initial state.
- Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is false at the initial state.
- Because C3 does not hold at least at the initial state, ""always C3"" (C4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initially event2 happened (so at the current/initial state event2 has occurred).
2. The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 has already happened initially, no events can occur in any following state (including the next state).
3. C1 says ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given (2), event1 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is false.
4. C3 is C1 and C2, so C3 is false.
5. C4 says C3 always holds; since C3 is already false in the next state, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred, no future events can occur.
- C1 and C2 each assert ""Event1 happens in the next state."" They are the same claim.
- C3 is C1 ∧ C2, so it is true exactly when event1 happens in the next state.
- C4 asserts that C3 holds in all states (i.e., event1 happens in the next state in every relevant situation).

Step 3 — reason through the sequence
- Since event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false, so C3 is false in the relevant next state.
- Because C3 is already false in that state, it cannot be true ""always.""

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Therefore event1 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2 is ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 holds, C2 is true.
- C3 is ""event1 happens and C2 holds"" — this requires event1 to happen, but event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4 asserts that C3 always holds; since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 occurs, the timeline stops — no event1 can occur afterward.
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen. (This is irrelevant if event1 never occurs, but it would also stop the timeline if event1 occurred.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given event2 happened initially and that prevents any subsequent events, event1 cannot happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (the disjunction is satisfied).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" This requires event1 to happen. But event1 does not happen (C1 true), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false in the actual timeline, C3 does not hold (so it is not true that C3 always holds).

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).
- After event1 no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).
Given event2 happened initially, event1 does not occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (we just established event1 does not occur).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"", C2 is (Event1 or not Event1) — a tautology — so True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Since Event1 does not happen, C3 is False (conjunction false).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so it cannot always hold.

Step 1 — what C4 asks:
C4 says ""eventually C3 holds"", where C3 says ""in the next state, C2 holds"", and C2 says ""C1 always holds"", and C1 says ""event1 happens and event2 happens"".

Step 2 — understand the context constraints:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events—including event2—can ever occur thereafter).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur given the second constraint).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- event1 did happen (initially true).
- event2 cannot happen at any time because event1 has already happened and no events can happen after event1.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 and event2 happen"") is false (event2 never happens).

Question asked: Is C4 true given the context? (Answer must be True or False.)

Step 1 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 occurred.
- Once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards.
- If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens (both occur).
- C2: C1 always holds (in every state, both events happen).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state (in the next state it is true that in all future states both events happen).
- C4: Eventually C3 holds (at some future state the next state satisfies C2).

Step 3 — reason about possible traces
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 can never occur at any later time.
- Could event2 have occurred at the same time as the initial event1? Even if simultaneous occurrence were allowed, the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” requires event1 to occur after event2, not only simultaneously, so that would not satisfy the rule. Thus there is no trace in which both event1 and event2 occur with the required ordering.
- Therefore C1 is never true in any reachable state, so C2 (C1 always) cannot hold, hence C3 cannot hold in any next state, and therefore C4 (that C3 eventually holds) cannot hold.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. ""Initially, event1 happened"" means at the initial state event1 is true.
2. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" implies that once event1 has occurred (and it already has initially), there are no subsequent states in which any other event (including event2) can occur. In particular, event2 never happens at any state.
3. C1 is ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — this requires event2 to hold as well as event1. Since event2 never happens, C1 is false in every state.
4. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — false because C1 is false.
5. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false because C2 is false in every state.
6. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" — false because C3 is never true at any future state.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — facts and rules from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 → event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 → event1.)

From the initial event1 and the rule event1 → event2, event2 must happen (at least once). From event2 → event1, event1 also happens (again). So event2 definitely happens.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (we deduced event2 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 does happen (it happened initially), so the implication is true. Therefore C3 holds (is true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Step 2 — translate the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ event1 → event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen ⇒ event2 → event1.
So event1 and event2 are mutually implied, and since event1 initially happened, event2 happens as well.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event2 happens, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true, and event1 does happen, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 is the statement ""C3 does not hold."" We must determine whether that statement is true.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" ⇒ event2 happens (after the initial event1).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ⇒ if event2 happens then event1 happens.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false (event2 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — true (negation of C1).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 does hold, and event1 does happen (it was true initially and is required after event2), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (which says ""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the start of the timeline we have event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Also: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — if event1 were to occur, it would be followed by event2, but since event2 stops all subsequent events, any event1 that occurred before would be immediately followed by event2 and then nothing else.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this simplifies to ""Event1 happens"" (p or p ≡ p). So C1 asserts that event1 occurs somewhere.
- Given the context, the timeline starts with event2 and no events can occur after that. Therefore there is no occurrence of event1 after the initial event2. The context does not provide any earlier occurrence of event1, so we cannot conclude event1 happens. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") requires C1 to be true at all times; since C1 is already false, C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") and C4 (""C3 always holds"") likewise are false if the inner ones are false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: if event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- Rule: after event2 happens, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — consequences for event1
- Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 no events can happen, event1 can never occur at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C4
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" That is false (event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" is false because C1 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" is false because C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" is false because C3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What the hypothesis asserts:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just a repetition, so C1 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
   - C2: C1 always holds (i.e. ""always Event1 happens"").
   - C3: C2 always holds.
   - C4: C3 always holds.
   So C4 ultimately claims that Event1 happens (indeed, always).

2. Facts from the context:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   - (Also: after event1, event2 must happen — irrelevant unless event1 occurs.)

3. Consequences:
   - Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial point.
   - There is no earlier time before the initial point for event1 to have occurred (the timeline begins with the initial state), so Event1 does not happen anywhere in the timeline.

4. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1 (""Event1 happens"") is false.
   - Therefore C2, C3, and C4 (which assert C1 always holds) are also false.

Thus C4 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: at time 0 (initial state) event1 happened. The system must eventually do event2 after event1, and once event2 happens no further events occur.
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true (it already happened at time 0).
- C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true at time 0 (C1 holds and event1 happened at time 0).
- C3 (""event1 happens and C2 holds"") is true at time 0 (both conjuncts hold there).
- C4 states that C3 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state).

Counterexample showing C4 can be false: take the next state to be the occurrence of event2 (allowed by ""after event1, event2 must happen""). In that next state event1 does not happen (and after event2 no further events happen), so C3 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C4 is not guaranteed by the context, so the hypothesis C4 is False.
---
We need to decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Context restated as a timeline:
- S0 (initial): event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur after S0, so S1 has event2.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no events occur after S1 (S2 and beyond have no events).

Evaluate the Ci:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" At S0 this is true (event1 already happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" At S0 this is true (C1 true and event1 happens at S0).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" At S0 this is true (event1 happens at S0 and C2 holds).

C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — i.e., does C3 hold at S1?
- At S1, event2 happens, not event1. So the conjunct ""event1 happens"" in C3 is false at S1.
- Also, from S1's perspective, event1 does not occur in the future (no further events after S1), so C1 (and thus C2) would be false at S1 as a future-looking claim.

Therefore C3 is not true at S1, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what's asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true given the constraints.

Step 2 — interpret the context and possible trace
- Initially (state s0) event1 happened. So at s0: event1 = true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so sometime after s0 there is an event2).
- After event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Given these, the only possible simple trace is:
s0: event1 happens
s1: event2 happens
no further states.

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C4 at s0 and at s1
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" At s0 this is true (event1 has already happened at s0).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" At s0 both parts are true, so C2 is true at s0.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" At s0 event1 happens and C2 holds, so C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — we must check whether C3 is true at s1.
  At s1:
  - event1 does not happen at s1 (it occurred at s0 and, because event2 is terminal, will not occur again).
  - therefore C3 (which requires event1 happens at that state) is false at s1.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify goal
- We must decide whether C4 (which is ""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant to truth of C1–C4 beyond confirming event2 occurs).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" That requires true (C2) AND true (C3), but C3 is false.

Conclusion
- C4 is False.

We are asked whether C4 is True or False.

Step 1 — identify what's asserted:
- Context implies event1 happened, and then event2 must happen. So event2 does happen (and it is the last event).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition under the context:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (i.e., event2 does happen).
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" This requires both true and false, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- Context: event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., C2 says event2 does happen.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C4: C2 holds and C3 holds (i.e., event2 happens AND event2 does not happen).

Step 3 — trace the events:
- From the context, event1 happened and therefore event2 must happen. So event2 does happen.
- Therefore C1 and C3 (""event2 does not happen"") are false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"", equivalently ""event2 does happen"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context gives a single possible trace: initial state: event2 happened → next state: event1 happens → then no further events (terminal).

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" so C1 is true.

3. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" From the initial state the next state is the one where event1 has happened. In that state C1 is true (indeed vacuously true there because event2 does not hold in that state). So C2 holds (at least from the initial state and in the event1 state).

4. C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires C2 to hold in every state. But in the terminal state after event1 there is no further state, so the ""next"" operator fails there (in standard temporal semantics X p is false at a terminal position). Thus there exists a state where C2 does not hold, so C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
---
Goal: decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is True or False under the given scenario.

1) Restate the scenario as a short timeline:
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur in the next step, so
- s1: event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" makes s1 terminal (no further states with events).

2) Interpret the Ci:
- C1 = ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the given rule and is true in any state where whenever event2 occurs eventually event1 follows.
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state."" So at a state s, C2 means: in s's immediate successor state, C1 is true.
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (i.e. C2 holds in every state along the trace).
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold.""

3) Check C2 and C3 on the trace:
- At s0: the next state is s1; C1 is true in s1 (there event1 occurs or the implication is vacuously true), so C2 is true at s0.
- At s1: there is no next state (s1 is terminal). The ""next"" condition C2 is therefore false at s1 (next-state formulas are false at a terminal state). Hence C2 does not hold at s1.
- Since C2 fails at s1, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false on the trace.

4) Conclusion:
- C3 does not hold, so C4 is true.

Final answer: True.

Step 1 — identify the timeline:
- Let s0 be the initial state, s1 the next state, s2 the state after that.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially (in s0) event2 happened.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means that once event2 has occurred (as in s0), no events can occur in any later state (so no events at s1, s2, ...).
- “After event1, no other events can happen” is irrelevant here because event1 never happens given the previous point.

Step 3 — unpack the conditions:
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state” = event1 occurs in s1.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” = at s1, C1 is true ⇒ event1 occurs in s2.

- C4: “C3 holds or event1 happens” = (C3 true) OR (event1 happens at some referenced time; here that means event1 happens now).

Step 4 — evaluate under the context:
- Because event2 happened in s0 and after event2 no further events can occur, event1 does not occur in s1 or s2, nor in s0.

First identify what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context.

Interpret the context on a timeline:
- At the initial state (call it state0) event2 happened.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means in every later state (state1, state2, ...) no events occur.
- In particular, event1 never happens in any future state.

Examine each condition (evaluated at the initial state unless otherwise noted):
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state (state1).” Since no events can happen after event2, event1 does not happen in state1. So C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: at state1, C1 should be true (i.e., event1 happens in state2). But no events occur after state0, so event1 does not happen in state2, so C1 is false at state1, hence C2 is false at state0.
- C3: “Event1 happens and C2 holds.” Both conjuncts are false, so C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 holds or event1 happens.” Both disjuncts are false (event1 never happens), so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
C4 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initial fact: event2 happened in the initial state.
- Given: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Because event2 already happened initially, no event (including event1) can happen in any future state.
- Evaluate C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state""): false (event1 cannot happen).
- Evaluate C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. event1 happens two steps ahead): false.
- Evaluate C3 (""Event1 happens and C2 holds""): false (both conjuncts are false).
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"". Both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false."

Sample responses:
Identify the question:
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 holds and C3 holds) is true given the context.

Understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (at the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if a state has event1, the following state must have event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if a state has event2, the following state must have event1).

Trace the sequence starting from the initial state:
- Initial state: event2 occurred.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state must have event1.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", the state after that must have event2.
So the sequence is: initial state (event2) → next state (event1) → next next state (event2) → ...

Examine the conditions in the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From the initial state, the next state has event1, not event2. So C1 is false.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C4 (which is ""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is true, given the context.

1) Context restated: initially event2 occurred. The rules force alternation: after event2 the next state must have event1, and after event1 the next state must have event2. So from the initial state S0 (where event2 happened), S1 must have event1, S2 must have event2, etc.

2) Evaluate the conditions at the initial state:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From S0 the next state S1 has event1 (not event2), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 does happen at S0, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C4 (C2 and C3) is true given:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (next state after event1 has event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (next state after event2 has event1).

Interpret ""after X"" as ""in the next state after a state where X happens."" Let states be S0 (initial), S1, S2, ...
- S0: event2 (given).
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", S1 must have event1.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", S2 must have event2.
So events alternate: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, ...

Now evaluate the conditions at S0:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — asks if S1 has event2. S1 has event1, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — requires event2 now (true at S0) and C1 (false), so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so false.
- C4: C2 and C3 — false AND false = false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
C4 is the statement ""C3 does not hold."" We must determine whether C4 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is the last event).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Because event1 already happened initially, the implication event2 ⇒ event1 is true (if event2 occurs later, event1 is already true). So C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 holds now, therefore it also holds at some time (indeed immediately), so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C2 holds and event1 happened), so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and its consequences
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 will occur at some later point.
- After event2, no other events can happen → the timeline is: event1 (initial) → event2 (later) → stop.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" In the actual timeline event1 already happened before event2, so whenever event2 happens, event1 has happened; C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds, so it certainly holds at some (indeed all) times — C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (event1 happened initially and C2 is true), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This negates a true statement (C3), so C4 is false.

False

Step 2 — examine each condition using the context:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, nothing else can happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event1 already happened initially, any occurrence of event2 will be accompanied by event1 having happened earlier — so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds (from the initial state onward), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (event1 happened initially and C2 is true), so C3 is true.

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What is being asked:
- C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold"" in the current (initial) state. We must determine whether that assertion is true or false given the context.

2) Translate the context into facts about the initial state and the next state:
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state, event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so in the next state neither event1 nor event2 happen).
- (After event2 no other events can happen is irrelevant because event2 does not occur initially.)

3) Evaluate the conditions in the initial state:
- C1: ""event2 or event1"" — true in the initial state because event1 happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — false because in the next state no events happen, so neither event1 nor event2 holds; therefore C1 is false in the next state.
- C3: ""event1 or C2"" — true in the initial state because event1 happened (even though C2 is false).

4) Finally C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is true in the initial state, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So in the initial state, event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So in any state following the initial state, neither event1 nor event2 can occur.
- (Also: after event2 no events can happen, but event2 never occurs here because event1 already happened and blocks further events.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" In the initial state this is true because event1 happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In the next state, no events can happen, so neither event1 nor event2 holds there; hence C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" In the initial state event1 happens, so C3 is true (regardless of C2).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true in the initial state, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify what's being asked: C4 asserts that C3 does not hold; we must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Evaluate the conditions step by step.

1. Context: Initially event1 happened. Also: after event1, no other events can happen (so there is no later occurrence of event1 or event2).

2. C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens). In the initial state event1 happened, so C1 is true in the initial state.

3. C2 = “C1 holds in the next state.” Because after event1 no other events can happen, there is no next state in which event1 or event2 occurs. Thus in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds, so C1 is false in the next state. Therefore C2 is false.

4. C3 = (event1 happens) OR C2. In the initial state event1 happened, so C3 is true (regardless of C2).

5. C4 = “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 holds, C4 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- The question asks whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

- Simplify the conditions:
  - C1: ""event2 or event2"" is just ""event2"".
  - C2: ""C1 or event2"" is again ""event2"".
  - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" means ""event2 holds in the next state.""

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" (interpreted as event2 holds in the next state). So C3 is true (the next state has event2).

- C4 states: if C3 holds, then event2 happens (this is an assertion about the current state unless a temporal qualifier is given). In the initial (current) state event2 does not happen — the initial event was event1. So although C3 is true (it asserts event2 in the next state), that does not imply event2 happens now.

Therefore C4 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

2. Simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" → equivalent to event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" → since C1 ≡ event2, C2 ≡ event2.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" → C3 ≡ next(event2) (i.e., event2 holds in the next state).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" → C4 is next(event2) → event2 (antecedent is next(event2), consequent is event2 in the current state).

3. Use the context to produce a concrete trace
- Initially (time 0): event1 happened. So event1 true, event2 false at time 0.
- The rules state:
  - After event1, event2 must happen → whenever event1 holds at time t, event2 holds at time t+1.
  - After event2, event1 must happen → whenever event2 holds at time t, event1 holds at time t+1.
- Starting from time 0 (event1), the sequence alternates: time0: event1, time1: event2, time2: event1, ...

4. Evaluate C4 at the initial state
- At time 0, C3 (next(event2)) is true because event2 holds at time1.
- But event2 at time0 is false (we have event1 at time0).
- Therefore the implication next(event2) → event2 is false at time0 (true antecedent, false consequent).

Thus C4 does not hold. Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- States/time steps: S0 (initial), S1 (next), S2, ...
- S0: event1 happens (and not event2).
- Rules: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" mean the next state after any event1 is event2 and vice versa. So the sequence is forced to alternate: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, ...

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" simplifies to just ""event2 happens"" (i.e. C1 ↔ event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" therefore is also equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" is therefore ""event2 holds in the next state.""

Step 3 — evaluate C3 in the initial state S0
- From the context, S1 (the next state) has event2, so C3 is true in S0.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this with the consequent evaluated at the current state (no temporal qualifier), in S0 the antecedent C3 is true but event2 does not happen in S0 (S0 has event1). So the implication is false.

Reasoning step-by-step

1. Start state: event1 has happened.
2. The context says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So there is no next state in which any event (including event2) occurs after the initial state.
3. C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false, because there is no next state with event2 (no events can follow event1).
4. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false: there is no future point where C1 becomes true.
5. C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is already false now.
6. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false: there is no future point where C3 becomes true.

Therefore C4 is False.

We are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Step-by-step:
1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen next. So C1 is false.
2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is false now and can never become true (no further events possible), so C2 is false.
3. C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and will never become true, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there are no occurrences of event1 or event2 in any state after the initial one).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 does not occur in the initial state).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True in the initial state (event1 happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" True in the initial state (C1 true and event1 happened).

Step 3 — move to the next state
- Because no events can happen after event1, in the next state neither event1 nor event2 happens.
- Therefore in the next state:
  - C1 is false (neither event occurs).
  - C2 = (C1 and event1) is false (event1 does not happen in the next state).

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This is false (we just determined C2 is false in the next state).

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Final answer:

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened, so C1 (""event1 or event2 happens"") is true in the initial state.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is therefore true in the initial state (C1 true and event1 happened).
- But the context says ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so in the next state no event occurs: neither event1 nor event2 happens there. Hence C1 is false in the next state, and event1 does not happen in the next state, so C2 is false in the next state.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is thus true.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So the state after the initial one has no events.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant because event2 does not occur initially.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. True in the initial state (event1 happens).
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens. True in the initial state (both are true).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state. This asks whether C2 is true in the state after the initial one.
  - In the next state no events occur (because event1 occurred initially), so neither event1 nor event2 happens there.
  - Therefore C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false in the next state. Hence C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context and sequence of events:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- After event1, event2 must occur.
- So the timeline is an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (both events occur repeatedly).

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p). It is true at any time when evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true at every time, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts C2; because C2 is true, C3 is false (and remains false at all times).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 never becomes true, C4 is false.

Final answer:

First, the question: is C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") true or false?

Step-by-step:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and is true at every point in time regardless of which events occur.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it indeed holds at every time, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line (C2 is true), so C3 is false at every time.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is never true, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" We must decide True or False.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P). It is true whenever evaluated, so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it indeed always holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That asks whether C3 becomes true at some time. C3 is false (and nothing in the event pattern can make the tautology C1 stop holding), so C3 never becomes true.

- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur at some future point.
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal after event2).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false because event2 is guaranteed to happen after event1.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is false (event2 does happen), there is no point at which ""event2 does not happen"" becomes true as a global claim about the run; so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Event2 does happen, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1) From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 event2 must happen. So at some point event2 occurs. Also after event2 no further events can occur.

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context this is false at the initial point because event2 is required to occur after event1.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Two readings:
  - If C1 means ""no future occurrence of event2 ever,"" then C1 is false initially but becomes true after the (single) occurrence of event2 (there are no further event2's), so C2 could be true under that reading.
  - If C1 is intended as a global denial (event2 never happens at all), then C1 never holds, so C2 is false.
  In either case below, the truth of C2 does not affect the final outcome.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since event2 does happen (forced by the context), C3 is true regardless of the reading of C2.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Because C3 holds, C4 is false.

Therefore C4 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
1. From the context: event1 happened initially, and ""after event1, event2 must happen."" Hence event2 does happen at some point.
2. C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") contradicts the required occurrence of event2, so C1 is false.
3. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") would require that the (global) claim ""event2 does not happen"" becomes true at some future time. Since event2 does occur, C1 can never become true, so C2 is false.
4. C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is true because event2 does happen (the left disjunct is true).
5. C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is therefore false.

Therefore C4 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the initial constraints about events.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
- Hypothesis formulas:
  - C1: event2 happens or event1 happens (event2 ∨ event1).
  - C2: not C1.
  - C3: event1 happens or C2 (event1 ∨ C2).
  - C4: C3 always holds.

Step 3 — evaluate in the given scenario
- Initially event2 happens. So C1 is true (because event2 happens).
- Therefore C2 (which is ¬C1) is false.
- C3 is (event1 ∨ C2). Since event1 does not happen (it can’t happen after event2, and the initial event is event2) and C2 is false, C3 is false in the initial state.
- Because C3 is false in that state, ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.

Final answer: False

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

1. Context facts:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 does not hold.""
- C1 does hold, so C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds.""
- C2 is false, so C3 reduces to ""Event1 happens.""
- But event1 cannot happen (event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen), so event1 does not happen. Therefore C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds.""
- C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Thus C4 is False.

False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" The context states initially event2 happened, so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — therefore C2 is false.
- C3 is ""event1 happens or C2 holds."" With C2 false, C3 reduces to ""event1 happens.""
- Can event1 happen? After the initial event2 no other events can happen, and ""initially event2 happened"" implies event1 did not occur before that. So event1 does not happen, hence C3 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 has happened, and the context says that after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not occur now or at any future state.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because event2 never happens.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is false.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false: there is no next state after the terminal state reached by event1 (or, if one treats a next state as existing, C2 is still false there), so C3 does not hold.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is therefore false because C3 is false.

Hence C4 is False.

Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the scenario
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Because event1 has already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event2 can never occur, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (already false in the initial state), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state does not make C2 true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true given the context.

Interpretation of context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (no events occur in any successor state of a state where event1 held).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant unless event2 actually occurs).

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This means event2 must hold (be true) in the current state. But the initial state has event1 (and no statement says event2 also held initially). Because after event1 no further events can occur, there is no later state where event2 could be made to hold. Therefore event2 does not hold in all states; C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false at the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state after the initial state is one where no events occur; C2 is false there as well, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false (it does not hold in the next state), C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 states ""C3 always holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the described system behavior.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions (temporal reading)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. at the current state and all future states).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the immediate next state, event2 always happens).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (i.e. sometime in the future there is a state whose next state has event2 always).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (i.e. at every state, sometime in the future C2 will hold).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
Initially event1 happened, and the rules force alternation: e1, e2, e1, e2, ... forever.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (G e2) is false at every state, because whenever event2 holds at a state there is always a later state where event1 holds (alternation), so event2 does not hold at all future times.
- Since C1 is false at every state, C2 (X C1) is false at every state.
- Since C2 never holds at any state, C3 (F C2) is false at every state.
- Therefore C4 (G C3) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Interpret the statements as temporal properties on a discrete trace. ""Always"" = at every state (G); ""in the next state"" = X; ""eventually"" = sometime in the future (F). So
- C1 = G(event2) (event2 at every state).
- C2 = X(C1) (C1 holds at the next state).
- C3 = F(C2) (C2 holds at some future state).
- C4 = G(C3) (C3 holds at every state).

2) From the context we get the infinite alternating trace (starting at t=0):
t0: event1
t1: event2
t2: event1
t3: event2
...
(event1 and event2 alternate forever.)

3) Evaluate conditions on that trace:
- C1 (G event2) is false: event2 does not occur at t0, t2, ... so it is not true at every state.
- C2 (X C1) is false at every state: at any state s the next state s+1 is either event2 or event1, but in all cases C1 (event2 at every state from s+1 onward) is false because the subsequent state after s+1 contains the other event. So X C1 never holds.
- C3 (F C2) is false: since C2 never holds at any future state, there is no future time where C2 becomes true.
- C4 (G C3) is therefore false because C3 is false (indeed C3 fails everywhere).

Thus C4 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- Interpret the conditions in linear-time temporal logic:
  - C1 = G(event2) (event2 holds always).
  - C2 = X C1 (in the next state, C1 holds).
  - C3 = F C2 (eventually C2 holds).
  - C4 = G C3 (C3 holds always).

- System behavior: at t0 event1 happened; the rules force alternation: t1 event2, t2 event1, t3 event2, … So event2 holds exactly at odd time steps, not at even ones.

- Evaluate:
  - C1 (G event2) is false (event2 is false at t0, t2, …).
  - C2 (X C1) is false at t0 because C1 is false at t1 (and indeed C1 is false at every state).
  - C3 (F C2) is false because C2 never becomes true at any future time.
  - C4 (G C3) is therefore false.

Step 1 — identify the question
- C4 asserts ""C3 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C3). We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from the initial point, event1 will occur at some future point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal, but that only means no further events occur after it).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and event2 has already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" From any state that is after event2, event1 is still required to happen in the future, so in the immediate next state C1 remains true. Thus C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" By the same reasoning one step further, every future state before event1 occurs still satisfies that event1 will eventually occur, so C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 says C3 does not hold. But we have established C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Goal: determine truth of C4 (""C3 does not hold"") given the context.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — consequences for possible sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and event2 must follow, the actual sequence is event1 then event2. Thus event2 does happen, and event1 has happened (before it).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Given the context, whenever event2 happens it is preceded by the initially true event1, so C1 is true.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 (and C2) hold, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" That contradicts the established truth of C3, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what is asked:
C4 says ""C3 does not hold."" The question asks whether C4 is True or False.

Step 2 — restate the conditions:

- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
C2: same as C1.
Because event1 did happen initially and event2 does happen later, the implication ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" is true (event1 occurs in the timeline). Thus C1 is true, and so is C2.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 and C4:
C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 (and C2) hold, C3 is true.
C4 states ""C3 does not hold."" That contradicts the fact that C3 is true, so C4 is false.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Both parts are true (C1 true, event2 did happen), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" In the actual run, event1 does happen and C2 is true, so the implication in C3 is true (event1 → C2 holds).

Step 3 — evaluate C4
C4 asserts that C3 does not hold. But we found C3 does hold. Therefore C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So ""event2 happens"" is true.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So the implication ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" is true.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This doesn't prevent earlier facts from being true.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Both parts are true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is already true unconditionally, so the implication is true (a true consequent makes an implication true). Therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 holds, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First, the question asks whether C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true or false.

Examine each condition with the given context:
- Context: event2 happened initially. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context rule, so C1 holds (is true).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is true and event2 did happen, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" In the actual history event1 does happen (it follows event2), and C2 is true; thus the implication in C3 is satisfied, so C3 holds (is true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 occurred. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents event2 from ever occurring after that initial event1.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 and event2 happen"") cannot be true.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You must determine the truth of C4 given the context and the chain C1 → C2 → C3 → C4.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no event2 can occur afterward).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event2 can never occur).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given event1 happens initially and that prevents any other events afterward, event2 cannot happen anywhere. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false now and no events can make it true later, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — extract constraints:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 can never happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" This is false because event2 cannot happen after the initial event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is true, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C4 is true given the context.

Context:
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 is true.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Not needed further.)

Evaluate conditions:
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens. Given event2 happens initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot also happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds. Since event2 happens, C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: C2 holds and C3 holds. That requires both true, but C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what’s asked
You’re asked whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.  
- After event2, no other events can happen.  
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens.  
  Given event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen after event2. There is no earlier time for event1 because event2 happened initially, so event1 did not occur. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds.  
  event2 does happen, so C2 is true.
- C3: event2 happens and event1 happens.  
  Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: C2 holds and C3 holds.  
  That requires both true, but C2 is true and C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False

- After event2, no other events can happen (nothing can occur after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (nothing can occur after event1).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Since event2 happened initially and nothing can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur after event2. It also cannot have occurred before the initial event2 (because event2 is initial). So event1 did not happen. Therefore C1 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 is the claim ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions in the initial state
- Initially, event2 happened.
- From ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" no events (neither event1 nor event2) occur in any state following the initial one.

Now evaluate the Ci:
- C1 = (event1 or event2). In the initial state event2 happened, so C1 is true initially.
- C2 = (event1 or C1). Since C1 is true initially, C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" In the next state no events occur (by the rule after event2), so in that next state event1 is false and event2 is false, hence C1 is false there and so C2 (event1 or C1) is false in the next state. Therefore C3 is false in the initial state.
- C4 = C3 ∧ event1. C3 is false, so C4 is false (regardless of event1).

Conclusion
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The question asks whether C4 is true given the context.

- Simplify the conditions:
  - C1: event1 or event2.
  - C2: event1 or C1 = event1 or (event1 or event2) = event1 or event2 — so C2 is equivalent to C1.
  - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — so C3 says that in the next state, event1 or event2 occurs.
  - C4: C3 holds and event1 happens now.

- Use the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore in the initial state event2 (not event1) occurs, and in every next state no events occur. So in the next state neither event1 nor event2 happens, hence C3 is false. Also event1 does not happen in the current (initial) state.

- C4 requires both event1 now and C3 (a future event) to be true. Since C3 is false (and event1 does not occur), C4 is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true.
- Then C2 (""event1 or C1"") is true (because C1 is true).
- C3 asserts ""C2 holds in the next state."" But after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no subsequent state in which to evaluate C2 (or, equivalently, C2 does not hold in any next state). Thus C3 is false.
- C4 requires both C3 and ""event1 happens."" Since C3 is false (and event1 does not happen after event2), C4 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions with the context
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterward).  
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (event1 did happen initially).  
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.  
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is false but event1 does happen, so C3 is true.  
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 does hold, so C4 would require that event2 happens. But given event1 already happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen. Therefore the implication in C4 is not satisfied.

Conclusion
C4 is False.
---
Step 1 — from the context:
- Event1 happened initially.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no event (including event2) can occur after that initial event1.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (context says event1 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is false but event1 does happen, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" Here C3 is true but event2 does not happen (blocked by event1). An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.  
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Not directly relevant because event2 cannot occur here.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false, because event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (event1 did happen), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" This is true because event1 does happen (the disjunction is true).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C3 is true, so for C4 to be true we need event2 to happen. But event2 cannot happen because event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore the consequent is false while the antecedent is true, so the implication C4 is false.

Step 1 — What’s being asked
- Determine whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition using the context
- Context: event1 happened initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So whenever event1 happens, event2 happens afterwards.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context → C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1 → C3 is true.

Step 3 — Evaluate C4
- C4 is the implication (C2 → C3). In classical logic an implication is true whenever the antecedent is false (vacuous truth), regardless of the consequent. Here C2 is false and C3 is true, so the implication holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This makes ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" true.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Completes the cycle but not needed further here.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" — True by the context.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False, because C1 does hold.
- C3: same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" — an implication.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- The antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true in classical logic.
- Also the consequent C3 is actually true, so the implication is true regardless.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: event1 happens initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So whenever event1 happens, event2 happens (C1 matches the context).
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" — True given the context.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False (since C1 is True).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" — Same as C1, so True.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" The antecedent C2 is False. In standard (material) implication, an implication with a false antecedent is True regardless of the consequent. So C4 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That means once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can ever occur afterward.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen — but this is irrelevant because event1 does not occur before event2 in the given initial condition.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Because C1 is false, C2 is false (and furthermore event1 cannot happen after the initial event2 because no events can happen after event2).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false now and cannot become true later (no further events can occur to make event1 happen), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false and cannot become true in the future, C4 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — unpack the context and the conditions
- Context: Initially, event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen; likewise after event1 no other events can happen. So event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has occurred, the system has no further events.
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds.
- C3: C2 eventually holds.
- C4: C3 eventually holds.

Step 3 — reason through the timeline
- Since initially event2 happened, C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event1 to happen; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- Because event2 already happened and after event2 no further events can occur, event1 cannot occur at any future time. So C2 can never become true, hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- If C3 can never become true, then C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future time C3 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, no event1 can ever occur.)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen initially), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C2 requires C1 (which is false) and event1. Because C1 is false, C2 is false (and event1 cannot occur after event2 anyway).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is never true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is never true, C4 is false.

Final answer:
False"
