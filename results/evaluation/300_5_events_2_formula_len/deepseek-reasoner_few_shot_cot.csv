- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, the system must transition to event1, event2, or event4. This means that in the state following event3, event3 does not happen; instead, one of event1, event2, or event4 occurs.
- Similarly, from event1, the system transitions to event3 or event5; from event2, it transitions to event3; from event4, it transitions to event1 or event3. In all cases, event3 does not happen in every state because transitions always lead to other events where event3 is not present.
- Therefore, event3 cannot happen in every state. There will always be states where event1, event2, event4, or event5 occurs, meaning event3 is not happening in those states.

Analyzing all possible paths:
- From event1: always goes to event5, so event5 eventually happens.
- From event2: goes to event3, then to event1 or event5, both of which lead to event5.
- From event3: goes directly to event1 or event5, both leading to event5.
- From event4: goes to event1, event2, or event3, all of which eventually lead to event5.
- From event5: since event5 has already occurred, ""eventually happens"" is immediately true. When transitioning to event1 or event4, both eventually lead back to event5.

However, from event5, the transitions lead to event1, event3, or event4, as per the context. None of these events (event1, event3, or event4) satisfy C1 because they are not event2 or event5. Therefore, when in event5, the next state does not satisfy C1, making C2 false.

Similarly, from event3, transitions can lead to event1, event4, or event5. While event5 satisfies C1, event1 and event4 do not. Since there is a possible transition from event3 to event1 or event4, where C1 is false, C2 does not hold in all cases from event3.

Thus, C2 is not true for all possible transitions, so it is false.

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen. Therefore, from the initial state, event4 occurs immediately.
- After event4, no other events can happen, so once event4 occurs, it remains true, and C1 holds from that point onward.
- Considering other transitions:
  - After event3, the next event must be event1, event4, or event5. If event1, then event4 follows; if event4, it directly holds; if event5, then from event5, the next event must be event1, event2, or event4.

- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, the next event must be event1, event2, or event5.
- If the next event is event1, then after event1, event2 must happen, so event2 eventually happens.

Initially, Event5 occurred. From Event5, the next event can be Event1, Event2, or Event3. If Event2 or Event3 occurs immediately, C1 holds. If Event1 occurs, then from Event1, the next event is Event3 or Event4. If Event3 occurs, C1 holds. If Event4 occurs, then from Event4, Event3 must occur, so C1 holds.

Similarly, from Event3, the next event can be Event2, Event4, or Event5. If Event2 or Event4 occurs, C1 holds directly or through Event3. If Event5 occurs, the same reasoning applies: from Event5, Event1, Event2, or Event3 will eventually lead to Event2 or Event3.

From Event2, the next event can be Event1, Event3, or Event4, all of which eventually lead to Event3.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, we need to determine if C2 is true or false. C2 states that ""C1 does not hold,"" where C1 is ""Event4 eventually happens."" This means C2 is true if there exists at least one sequence of events from the initial state where event4 never happens.

Initially, event3 happened. From event3, the transitions allow going to event1 or event2. If we choose to go to event1, then after event1, we can go to event2 or event3. If we go to event2, then after event2, we must go to event1. This creates a cycle between event1 and event2 (and possibly event3) where event4 is never involved. Similarly, if we go from event1 to event3, then from event3 we can again go to event1 or event2, maintaining the cycle without event4.

Since there is a possible sequence (e.g., event3 → event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...) where event4 never occurs, C1 is false. Therefore, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

</graphml>",1,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C1 states that event5 always happens, meaning event5 must be true in every state. However, initially event4 happened, so event5 is not true in the initial state. Therefore, C1 is false. Since C2 is defined as C1 does not hold, and C1 is false, C2 is true.

Additionally, the transition rules ensure that event5 cannot always be true because after event5, the system must transition to event2 or event4, so event5 does not remain true indefinitely. Thus, there is no sequence where event5 always happens, confirming that C1 is false and C2 is true.

Starting from the initial state where event5 happened, the transitions are as follows:
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - If event1 happens, then C1 holds, so C2 is true.
  - If event2 happens, then event3 must happen (since after event2, event3 must happen), so event3 happens, and C2 is true.

After event3, the transitions lead to event1, event4, or event5:
- If event1 occurs, C1 holds and C2 is true.
- If event4 occurs, then from event4, either event1 or event2 must happen, leading to event1 or event3, so C2 is true.
- If event5 occurs, then from event5, event4 must happen, and from event4, either event1 or event2 must happen, again leading to event1 or event3, so C2 is true.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, C2 is defined as ""C1 holds in the next state,"" where C1 is ""Event5 happens in the next state."" This means that for C2 to be true at the initial state (where event2 happened), C1 must be true at the next state (state 1). C1 being true at state 1 requires that event5 happens at state 2.

However, from the initial state (event2), the next state (state 1) must have either event3 or event4, as per the transition after event2. From state 1:
- If event3 occurs, the next state (state 2) must have either event1 or event2.
- If event4 occurs, the next state (state 2) must have either event1 or event3.

In neither case does event5 occur at state 2. Furthermore, event5 is never reached in any sequence from the initial state, as no transition leads to event5. Therefore, C1 cannot be true at state 1, making C2 false at the initial state.

Since event5 never occurs, C1 is always false, and thus C2 is always false.

However, from the context, after event2 occurs, the next event must be either event1 or event4, as stated: ""After event2, either event1, or event4 must happen.""

Since event2 only occurs initially and never again (as no transitions lead to event2 from any event), there is no state where both event2 occurs and event2 occurs in the next state. Thus, C2 is always false.

Since the initial state is event5, C1 is immediately true because event5 has already happened. Therefore, for C2 to be true, event2 must happen at some point in all possible sequences.

From event5, the transitions allow either event2 or event4 to happen. If event4 is chosen, then after event4, event5 must happen, creating a loop: event5 → event4 → event5 → event4 → ... This loop continues indefinitely without event2 ever happening.

Thus, there exists a sequence where C1 is true (event5 happens repeatedly), but event2 never happens. Therefore, the implication ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is false.

- The initial event is event4, and the transitions form a cycle: event4 → event3 → event5 → event4 → ... 
- In this cycle, event3 occurs repeatedly, so ""event3 happens"" is true.
- However, event2 never occurs in this cycle because there is no transition from event4, event3, or event5 to event2 or event1. Therefore, event2 does not always happen; in fact, it never happens. Thus, C1 is false.

Therefore, C2 is False.

However, from the transitions:
- After event1, the next event can be event2, event3, event4, or event5.
- Since event4 and event5 are possible next events from event1, and neither event4 nor event3 satisfies C1 (as C1 requires event2 or event3), there are transitions where C1 does not hold in the next state.

Therefore, C2 is not true for all transitions, specifically when moving from event1 to event4 or event5. Thus, C2 is false.

</graphml>",0,"Based on the context and hypothesis, we need to determine if C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" is true, where C1 is ""Event3 eventually happens."" This means we must check if in all possible sequences of events from the initial state, event3 eventually occurs.

The initial state is event1. From event1, the possible next events are event2, event4, or event5. Similarly, from event2, the next events are event1, event4, or event5. From event4, event5 must happen, and from event5, event4 must happen, creating a loop between event4 and event5. From event3, the next events are event1, event2, or event4.

Crucially, there is no rule that forces event3 to happen from event1, event2, event4, or event5. Therefore, it is possible to avoid event3 entirely by:
- Cycling between event1 and event2, or
- Entering the event4-event5 loop.

In such sequences, event3 never occurs, so C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is false throughout these sequences. Since C1 is always false in these cases, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") cannot be true because C1 never holds.

Thus, C2 is false.
