Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → either event2 or event5.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event4.
- After event3 → event1.
- After event4 → event2.
- After event5 → event2.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event1 nor event2 happens).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event3, rule ""after event3 → event1"" means event1 will happen.
- After that event1 happens, rule ""after event1 → event2 or event5"" means either event2 happens immediately, or event5 happens.
- If event5 happens, the rule ""after event5 → event2"" forces event2 to happen next.
- Thus in every possible branch following the rules, event1 happens (from event3) and event2 happens (either directly after event1 or after event5). Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (so event5 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules (deduplicated)
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event5} must occur.
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4, event5} must occur.
- After event2 → event4 must occur.
- After event4 → one of {event2, event3} must occur.
- After event5 → event3 must occur.

(“Must” here is interpreted as: from that event the next event must be chosen from the given set.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens and event5 happens.” (Both events occur at some point.)
- C2: “C1 holds or event5 happens.” (Logical OR: C2 is true if either C1 is true or event5 is true.)

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- event5 is given as having happened initially, so the disjunct “event5 happens” is true immediately.
- Therefore C2 = (C1 or event5) is true regardless of whether C1 also holds.
- (As an additional note: C1 is also satisfiable under the rules — e.g. sequence 5 → 3 → 2 → 4 yields both event5 and event4 — but that is not needed to conclude C2 is true.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (this is the current/initial state).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event1 → event5 must happen.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3} must happen.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2} must happen.
(You repeated the last rule; it is redundant.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens."" (i.e., at a given moment, either event1 or event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some time now or in the future, C1 will be true.)

4) Relation and reasoning (why C2 is true)
- At the initial moment event3 has already happened, so C1 is already true immediately (because event3 occurred). Therefore ""eventually C1"" is trivially satisfied.
- Even if one interprets ""eventually"" to mean strictly in the future (not counting the initial occurrence), the transitions still guarantee C1 within one or two steps:
  - From event3 the next event must be either event1 or event2.
    - If it is event1 → C1 holds right away.
    - If it is event2 → after event2 the next event must be event1 or event3 → C1 holds on that next step.
- Thus on every possible path starting from the initial event3, C1 becomes true (either immediately or within two steps).

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event3 has already happened, so C1 (event1 or event3) holds immediately. Even if ""eventually"" excludes the current moment, the transitions after event3 force the next event to be event1 or event2; if it's event2 then the following event must be event1 or event3. Thus on every path C1 occurs within at most two steps."

Short answer: C2 is False. C1 can hold (there are valid sequences where both event2 and event3 occur). Explanation step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happens first.

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event5 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event4} must happen.
- After event4 → no further events can happen (terminal).
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the context but they don't change the set of allowed transitions.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens."" (i.e., both events occur somewhere in the sequence.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., it is not the case that both event2 and event3 occur.)

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation
- Starting from the initial event5, we must go 5 → 1 (by the rule for event5).
- From event1 we may choose event2 or event3 (or event4). To satisfy C1 we only need a sequence that includes both event2 and event3 at some points.
- Example valid sequence that includes both: 5 → 1 → 2 → 3. (After 5 → 1 is forced; after 1 choose 2; after 2 choose 3; after 3 choose 1 or 4 next — but the sequence 5,1,2,3 already contains both event2 and event3, so C1 holds.)
- Another valid sequence: 5 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 2 (also contains both).

Because at least one valid sequence satisfies C1, C1 can be true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event3 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (duplicates consolidated)
- After event5 → one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event1 → one of {event3, event5}.
- After event2 → event3.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event3}.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Interpreting this in the natural senses:
  - If read as “event3 holds at every step (globally)”, it requires every state to be event3.
  - If read as “event3 occurs infinitely often (always eventually) on every possible execution”, it requires that every infinite trace visits event3 infinitely often.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (the negation of C1)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- C2 is simply the negation of C1, so exactly one of C1 or C2 must be true.
- Provide a concrete counterexample trace to show C1 is false under either reasonable reading:
  - Start: event3 (given).
  - Choose transitions: 3 → 1, then 1 → 5, then 5 → 1, then 1 → 5, … and repeat (1 ↔ 5 loop).
  - This infinite trace has only event1 and event5 after the initial event3, so event3 does not hold at every step, and it does not occur again (so not infinitely often).
- Therefore C1 is false and C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed (it is false as a logical consequence). There is a valid run that makes C2 false. Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (we start at event5).

2) Transition rules
- After event5: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: event5 must happen.
- After event4: event5 must happen.

(One of the “after event3, event5 must happen” lines was duplicated; same rule.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” I read this as “event1 never occurs in the run.”
- C2: “Event4 happens or C1 holds.” i.e. (event4 occurs at some point) OR (event1 never occurs).

4) How the conditions relate; truth of C2
- To show C2 must hold, every possible run starting from the initial event5 would have to satisfy (event4 occurs) or (event1 never occurs).
- But we can produce a valid run that violates C2: choose event1 whenever we leave event5 and choose event3 after event1. Example infinite run:
  event5 -> event1 -> event3 -> event5 -> event1 -> event3 -> event5 -> ...
  In that run event1 does occur (so C1 is false) and event4 never occurs. Thus (event4 happens) is false and C1 is false, so C2 is false in that run.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the system. It is satisfiable in some runs (e.g., if you always pick event2 and sometimes pick event4) but not universally true.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed (there exists a counterexample run), so as a logical consequence it is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample run: event5 -> event1 -> event3 -> event5 -> event1 -> ... . In that run event1 does occur (so C1 is false) and event4 never occurs, so (event4 happens) ∨ C1 is false. Thus C2 is not guaranteed."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (3 -> 2)
- After event2, one of event1, event4, or event5 must happen. (2 -> {1,4,5})
- After event1, no further events. (1 is terminal)
- After event4, no further events. (4 is terminal)
- After event5, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen. (5 -> {2,3,4})

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted in this transition model: every execution/path in which event4 occurs has at some point event2 occur (typically earlier in the path).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" A logical disjunction: C2 is true if either C1 is true, or event1 occurs in the execution (or both).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the transitions and the initial condition, any path must begin event3 -> event2. So event2 occurs immediately after the initial event3.
- The only ways to reach event4 are:
  a) directly after event2 (2 -> 4), or
  b) after event5 (5 -> 4). But to get to event5 in the first place one must have come from event2 (2 -> 5) or from a loop that itself goes through event2 (5 -> 3 -> 2 ...). In every case, event2 has occurred earlier in the execution before any occurrence of event4.
- Therefore C1 is true: whenever event4 occurs in any allowed execution starting from the given initial condition, event2 does occur (earlier).
- Since C1 is true, the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true regardless of whether event1 actually happens in a particular path.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Starting from the initial event3, event2 must occur (3 -> 2). Any allowed way to reach event4 (either directly 2 -> 4 or via 5 which itself comes from 2) therefore has event2 earlier in the execution. Hence C1 is true, and so the disjunction C2 (C1 or event1) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (restated)
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event3, one of {event2, event4} must happen. (this rule is listed twice but it is the same constraint)
- After event4, one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen. (this rule is also listed twice)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens.” (there exists some point at or after the current point where event3 occurs)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” (i.e., if you move one step forward from the initial state, from that new state C1 is true)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition we have event1, and the rule “after event1, event3 must happen.” Therefore event3 occurs immediately after the initial state. So C1 is true in the initial state.
- Now consider C2 (C1 holds in the next state). The “next state” following the initial state is exactly the state where event3 has occurred. Under the standard temporal logic convention for “eventually” (F p), “eventually” allows the current state to satisfy p (F p means p holds now or at some later point). Under that convention, since event3 holds in the next state, C1 is true in that next state — so C2 is True.

Note on possible ambiguity: if you instead interpret “eventually” as “at some strictly later state (not including the current state)”, then C1 could be false in the next state because the rules after event3 require the next event to be event2 or event4 (so there is no guarantee event3 will occur again later). Under that strict-future reading, C2 would be False. 

Most conventional readings of “eventually” (e.g., LTL’s F) include the current state, so the answer is: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initially (current state): event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (after X -> possible next events)
- after event3 -> event4 (must)
- after event4 -> event1 or event2 or event3
- after event1 -> event3 or event4
- after event2 -> event1 or event3 or event5
- after event5 -> event1 (must)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 happens in the next state” (i.e., the immediate next state after the initial one is event5).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., event5 does not happen in the next state).

4) How they relate (evaluation)
- Since the initial event is event3 and the rule after event3 is that event4 must happen next, the immediate next state is event4.
- Therefore event5 does not happen in the next state → C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, so C2 is true.

(As an aside: event5 could occur later in a possible future sequence—e.g., 3 → 4 → 2 → 5—but that does not affect the truth of C1/C2 about the immediate next state.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: nothing in the rules ever forces event5 to occur — it only constrains what must follow if event5 happens. You can satisfy ""event2 always happens"" without ever having event5. Example valid infinite trace starting from the given initial event1:

event1 -> event4 -> event3 -> event2 -> event4 -> event3 -> event2 -> ...

Transitions used respect the rules:
- event1 implies event4,
- event4 can lead to event3,
- event3 can lead to event2,
- event2 can lead back to event4,

This produces event2 repeatedly while never producing event5. Hence ""If C1 holds then event5 happens"" is not guaranteed."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initially (state 0) event4 happened.

2) Transition rules (after each event)
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event4, event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen.
(Several rules were repeated in the context; they are the same constraints.)

3) What the subconditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the initial one, event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1 (i.e., event1 does not happen in the next state).

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- Since initially event4 happened, the rule ""after event4, event5 must happen"" forces the next state to have event5.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened.

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal)
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event5 happens."" So both event5 and event3 occur.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the claim to evaluate (does C1 imply event2?).

4) How they relate / reasoning
- From C1 we know event3 happens.
- From the rule ""after event3, event4 must happen,"" event4 must occur after event3.
- From ""after event4, event2 must happen,"" event2 must occur after event4.
- Therefore, given event3 (and thus event4 following it), event2 necessarily happens.
- The initial event5 and its rule (""after event5 either event2 or event3 must happen"") are consistent with C1 because C1 includes event3. The terminal nature of event2 just means it ends the chain, which is consistent with the sequence.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initially: event3 happened (i.e., the current state is one where event3 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreted as ""the next state must satisfy …"")
- After event4, event5 must happen: 4 → next is 5.
- After event5, event3 must happen: 5 → next is 3.
- After event3, event1 must happen: 3 → next is 1.
- After event1, one of {2,3,4,5} must happen: 1 → next ∈ {2,3,4,5}.
- After event2, one of {1,3,4} must happen: 2 → next ∈ {1,3,4}.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., in the current state, event3 is false).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state after now, event3 is false).

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- We start with event3 true now. By the rule 3 → 1, the next state must have event1.
- Under the usual interpretation that exactly one event holds per state (so the next state being event1 means event3 is false there), the next state does not have event3.
- Therefore C1 (event3 does not happen) is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Note: If you allow multiple events to co-occur in a state (so the next state could be {event1, event3} simultaneously), the rules as given do not forbid event3 also holding next, and then C2 would not be guaranteed. Under the standard single-event-per-state reading, C2 = True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (we start at state event5).

2) Transition rules (interpreted as nondeterministic next-state options)
- event2 -> event3 (forced).
- event3 -> {event1, event5}.
- event1 -> event5 (forced).
- event5 -> {event1, event4}.
- event4 -> {event1, event2, event3}.
(Repeated rules in the text are the same and don't change the system.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens."" (In temporal logic: F event5.)
  Given the initial condition, C1 is true immediately (event5 already happened).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That is, at every point in time (in every reachable state) it remains true that event5 will occur eventually from that state. (In temporal logic: G F event5 — always eventually event5.)

4) How the conditions relate / proof that C2 is true
Do a simple backward-reachability (or fixpoint) argument to identify states from which event5 is unavoidable.

- Start with S = {event5} (from these states event5 is already true).
- event1 has a forced transition to event5, so from event1 event5 will happen next. Add event1 to S.
- event3 transitions only to event1 or event5; both are already in S, so event3 ∈ S.
- event2 transitions to event3 (which is in S), so event2 ∈ S.
- event4 transitions to event1, event2, or event3 — all in S — so event4 ∈ S.

Now S = {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5} — all states. That means from every possible state, every possible successor path leads (inevitably) to event5 at some future point. Therefore not only is C1 true initially, but C1 holds in every reachable state. Hence C2 (always C1) is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (nondeterministic choices)
- After event1: next is one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2: next is one of {event3, event5}.
- After event3: next is one of {event2, event5}.
- After event4: next is one of {event2, event5}.
- After event5: next is event1.
(Notes: the description repeats “after event5, event1 must happen” several times; that just reiterates the same rule. Choices are nondeterministic where a set is given.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Interpreted as: at every step (or in every reachable state/occurrence) event3 occurs (i.e., a universal/always property).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event3 happens.” Formally: C1 ⇒ (event3 happens). This is a conditional: if the universal claim C1 is true, then (the specific claim) event3 happens.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C2
- If C1 is true (event3 always happens), then in particular event3 happens. So C1 logically entails “event3 happens.” Therefore the implication C1 ⇒ event3 is true when C1 is true.
- More generally, a material implication P ⇒ Q is true whenever P is false (vacuously) or when P entails Q. Here either:
  - If C1 is true, it entails event3, so C2 is true; or
  - If C1 is false, C2 is still true (vacuously).
- Conclusion: C2 is True.

(As an extra note: C1 itself is not guaranteed by the transition rules — from the initial event3 you can follow a path that avoids event3 forever, e.g. event3 → event5 → event1 → event4 → event5 ... — so C1 is false in the given system. That does not affect the correctness of C2, which remains true.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Explanation: C2 is the implication C1 ⇒ (event3 happens). If C1 is true then by definition event3 always happens (so event3 happens), and if C1 is false the implication is vacuously true. Hence C2 is true."

I'll answer the four parts step by step. First I state the interpretation I use for C1 and C2 (if you meant a different temporal reading, tell me and I can re-evaluate).

Interpretation (standard temporal-reading):
- C1 = ""Event3 does not happen"" means: from now on, event3 never occurs (¬3 holds globally).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" means: at some future point there is a suffix of the run from which event3 never occurs (formally: F G ¬3).

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened initially (the run starts at event4).

2) Transition rules (given):
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event4 must happen next (2 → 4).
- After event4: one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen next (4 → {1,2,3}).
- After event3: one of event2, event4, or event5 must happen next (3 → {2,4,5}).
- After event5: no other events can happen (event5 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1 (as used above): from some point onward, event3 never occurs (i.e., event3 does not happen in the remainder of the run).
- C2: eventually C1 holds — there exists a time after which no event3 occurs (F G ¬3).

(If you instead meant C1 to mean ""event3 is not the current event right now"", then C2 would mean ""at some future moment event3 is not the current event"" — that is a different, weaker reading. Below I continue with the stronger reading.)

4) How these conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- From the initial state event4 you may choose any of {1,2,3}.
- There are runs that reach a terminal non-3 event (for example, 4 → 1 or 4 → 3 → 5 or 4 → 2 → 4 → 1, etc.). On those runs, from some point onward event3 never occurs, so C1 eventually holds. So C2 is satisfiable (there exist runs where C2 is true).
- However, the transition rules also allow an infinite cycle that includes event3 repeatedly: 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... is allowed (choose 3 after every 4 and choose 4 after every 3). On that run event3 occurs infinitely often, so there is no point after which event3 never occurs; C1 never becomes true and thus C2 fails on that run.

Therefore, C2 is not guaranteed true in all executions; it is false as a universal property of the system (because a counterexample run exists). If your question was whether C2 is true in at least one run, the answer is yes — some runs satisfy C2 — but if you mean ""is C2 always true from the initial state,"" the answer is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: from the initial event4 pick the transitions 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → … forever. Event3 occurs infinitely often on that run, so there is no point after which event3 never occurs; hence ""eventually C1 holds"" (F G ¬3) is false. 

(If you instead meant ""there exists a run where C1 eventually holds,"" that existential reading is True — some runs terminate without further 3s — but under the usual universal/read-all-runs reading C2 is False.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (summary)
- After event2 → one of {event1, event4, event5}.
- After event1 → event4.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event3, event5}.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event4}.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event4}.
(Several rules are repeated in the context but they do not contradict the above.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" i.e. C1 ≡ event1 ∨ event2.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" i.e. C2 ≡ event1 ∧ C1.

Algebraically C2 = event1 ∧ (event1 ∨ event2) which simplifies to event1 (because A ∧ (A ∨ B) ≡ A).

Step 4 — how they relate and final determination
- Since the initial condition states event1 happened, event1 is true.
- Therefore C1 is true (because event1 ∨ event2 is true).
- And C2 reduces to event1, so C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (what can happen after each event)
- After event3: either event2 or event5 must happen. (This was stated twice; same rule.)
- After event2: no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1: either event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event5: either event1, event2, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (i.e., at some point in the execution either event2 occurs or event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event5 happens."" (i.e., whenever (event2 or event1) occurs at some point, event5 also occurs at some point.)

Step 4 — how they relate; truth value of C2
- To test C2 we need a case where C1 holds but event5 does not happen. A simple allowed run provides such a counterexample:
  - From the initial event3 we may follow the allowed transition 3 → 2. That makes event2 occur, so C1 holds (because event2 happened). But event2 is terminal, so no further events (including event5) can occur. Thus C1 holds while event5 does not.
- Because such a run is permitted by the rules, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed and therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start with event3, then take 3 → 2. That makes C1 true (event2 happened) but event2 is terminal so event5 does not occur. Hence the implication in C2 is not guaranteed."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true/occurs initially).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- event3 → event2
- event2 → event1
- event1 → (event2 ∨ event4)
- event4 → event2
- event5 → (event2 ∨ event4)

(“A → B” reads “after A happens, B must happen” / “if A then B”.)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: event3 → event1 (If event3 happens, then event1 happens.)
- C2: event4 → C1 (If event4 happens, then C1 holds), i.e. event4 → (event3 → event1).

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the rules we have event3 → event2 and event2 → event1. By transitivity, event3 → event1. Therefore C1 is true (it follows from the rules).
- Since C1 is true unconditionally, the statement “if event4 happens then C1 holds” is also true: a true consequent makes the implication event4 → C1 true. (Equivalently, C1 does not depend on event4 — it already holds.)

Conclusion
- C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (read as “after X, Y must/ may happen”)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens and event4 happens” (both occur at some point in the sequence).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e. NOT(C1): at least one of event3 or event4 does not occur.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; can C1 occur?
- C1 is possible. Example sequence showing both event4 and event3 occur:
  event1 -> event4 (choose event4 after event1) -> event2 (choose event2 after event4) -> event3 (must follow event2).
  That sequence contains both event4 and event3, so C1 can be true.
- C1 is not guaranteed. Example sequence where event4 never occurs (so C1 is false):
  event1 -> event2 (choose event2 after event1) -> event3 -> event1 -> event2 -> ... (keep choosing the branches that avoid event4). This can avoid event4 while producing event3 repeatedly, so C1 can be false.

Conclusion about C2
- C2 (the negation of C1) is not determinable from the given information alone: it is neither necessarily true nor necessarily false. Both C1 and C2 are satisfiable (there are valid sequences where C1 holds and valid sequences where C1 does not hold). So the correct answer is: C2 is undetermined / contingent given the rules.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C2 says ""not(C1)"". That is not guaranteed by the rules — both C1 and its negation are possible.

- Sequence where C1 holds (both event3 and event4 occur): event1 -> event4 -> event2 -> event3.
- Sequence where C1 does not hold (avoid event4): event1 -> event2 -> event3 -> event1 -> event2 -> ... (never choose the branch to event4).

So C2 is not entailed by the rules; it can be true in some runs and false in others, therefore it is not true in all cases."

- After event3, event5 must happen. (E3 → E5)
- After event5, either event1 or event4 must happen. (E5 → (E1 or E4))
- After event1, no other events can happen. (E1 → terminal)
- After event4, event1 must happen. (E4 → E1)
- After event2, event4 must happen. (E2 → E4)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreting this as the global claim “event1 never occurs.”
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting this as “at some future point the statement C1 (event1 never occurs) will be true” — equivalently, there is a point from which event1 will never occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Start from the initial condition: event4 happened.
- By the rule E4 → E1, event1 must happen immediately after that initial event4.
- Once event1 happens, no further events can occur (E1 is terminal).
- Therefore event1 does occur in this execution, so the claim C1 (“event1 never occurs”) is false.
- Since C1 is false and, in fact, already violated by the initial steps, it cannot become true at any later point. Hence C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is also false.

Answer: C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened first.
- Also given: after event5, no other events can happen. So the run stops immediately after event5; no event1–event4 can ever occur in this execution.

2) Transition rules (after X, one of ...)
- After event1 → {event3, event4, event5}
- After event3 → {event2, event5}
- After event4 → {event1, event2, event5}
- After event2 → {event1, event4}  (this rule is repeated but identical)
- After event5 → no events (terminal)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen."" Given the initial event5 and the rule that nothing follows event5, C1 is true in the given scenario (event4 never occurs).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreted as the implication: (event1 happens) ⇒ (event4 does not happen).

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- In the actual system run described, event1 never happens (because event5 is initial and terminal). Therefore the antecedent ""event1 happens"" is false in every allowable execution.
- In classical logic a conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Hence (event1 ⇒ not event4) is true.
- Also, since event4 indeed does not happen in the described run, C1 is true as noted.

Therefore C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (so at time 0 the last/current event is event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event3, event5 must happen. (3 → 5)
- After event5, either event3 or event4 must happen. (5 → 3 or 5 → 4)
- After event4, event2 must happen. (4 → 2)
- After event2, either event1, event3, event4, or event5 must happen. (2 → 1 or 3 or 4 or 5)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (1 → 2)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event4 always happens.” Interpreting this as the global property that at every step (or in every future moment) event4 occurs — equivalently: event4 is guaranteed to occur indefinitely / at every required point (i.e., G(event4) in temporal-logic style).
- C2: “C1 holds or event4 happens.” This is the disjunction (C1) OR (event4 happens). Interpreting “event4 happens” here as “event4 holds/occurred at the relevant (current) point” (since we know it occurred initially).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth values
- C1 is false. Counterexample run starting from the initial event4:
  1. time0: event4 (given)
  2. time1: by 4 → 2, event2
  3. time2: choose 2 → 1, event1
  4. time3: by 1 → 2, event2
  5. time4: choose 2 → 3, event3
  6. time5: by 3 → 5, event5
  7. time6: choose 5 → 3, event3
  8. time7: 3 → 5, event5
  ... and repeat the 3↔5 loop forever.
  In this run, after the initial time0 event4 never occurs again, so event4 is not “always” happening. Therefore C1 is not true in general (there exists a valid run that violates it).
- C2 is true (at the initial point). Because C2 is “C1 or event4 happens.” Even though C1 is false, the right-hand disjunct “event4 happens” is true at the initial moment (we were given that initially event4 happened). Therefore the disjunction is true at that moment.

Summary answer to the direct question
- C1: false (not guaranteed in all runs).
- C2: true (true at the initial point because event4 happened).

- In the initial state event4 happened, so C1 is true in the initial state.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (it is given that initially event2 happened).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1 -> event5 must happen.
- After event5 -> either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3 -> either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event4 -> event3 must happen. (This was listed twice; same rule.)
- After event2 -> one of event1, event3, event4, or event5 must happen next.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (¬event1)
- C2: ""Event4 happens or C1 holds."" (event4 ∨ ¬event1)

Step 4 — how they relate and whether C2 is true
- C2 is equivalent to (event4) OR (not event1). So C2 fails exactly in the situation where event1 does happen and event4 never happens.
- From the rules there are several possible continuations after the initial event2. Some lead to event4 (making C2 true), some lead to no event1 (making C1 true, hence C2 true), but there is also a valid continuation in which event1 happens and event4 never occurs.

Counterexample showing C2 can be false:
- Choose the following allowed sequence starting from event2:
  2 -> 1 (allowed by rule after 2)  
  1 -> 5 (forced after 1)  
  5 -> 3 (choose 3 rather than 4)  
  3 -> 5 (choose 5 rather than 4)  
  5 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... (repeat indefinitely avoiding 4)
- In this sequence event1 does happen (so C1 is false) and event4 never happens, so event4 ∨ ¬event1 is false. Thus C2 is false in this allowed trace.

Conclusion
- C2 is not logically guaranteed by the rules (it is not always true). It can be true in some traces and false in others. Therefore C2 is not universally true — it can be false (as shown by the counterexample).

Short answer: C2 is False. Event3 does always happen, so C1 is True and C2 (its negation) is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (obligations)
- After event5, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — interpreted as: in every execution (every allowed trace consistent with the rules) event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1 (i.e., there is some execution in which event3 does not occur).

4) How they relate / reasoning
- From the initial event1 and the rules: event1 ⇒ event4 ⇒ event3 ⇒ event1. That gives a guaranteed chain starting from the initial event1 that produces event3 (and in fact cycles: once event1 occurs it forces 4, then 3, then 1 again, etc.).
- Therefore in every execution consistent with the rules event3 occurs (at least once, and because of the cycle it will continue to occur).
- So C1 is True.

Conclusion: C2 (the statement ""C1 does not hold"") is False.

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" Interpreted in standard temporal logic: at the current time there exists some time at or after now when event3 occurs (F event3).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That is, at every time point along the execution, C1 is true — equivalently, at every time point it is guaranteed that event3 will occur at some (current or future) time (G F event3).

Step 4 — how they relate and verdict
- At the initial time (time 0) event3 has happened, so C1 is true at time 0.
- But rule ""after event3 no other events can happen"" makes event3 terminal. In any later time point there is no future occurrence of event3 (no way to reach another event3), so F event3 is false at those later points.
- Therefore C1 is not true at all time points, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- After event1 → no further events (terminal).
- After event2 → one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event3}. (This rule was stated twice; it’s the same constraint.)
- After event4 → one of {event3, event5}.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event3 does not happen” (i.e., no occurrence of event3 in the run).
- C2: “C1 holds or event4 happens” = (not event3) OR event4. That is true if either event3 never occurs or event4 occurs (or both).

4) How these relate and final answer
- Because event4 happened initially, the disjunction (not event3) OR event4 is true regardless of whether event3 later occurs. Therefore C2 is true.
- Note: C1 itself is not forced by the rules (event3 can be avoided, e.g. 4 → 5 → 1 stops without event3; but event3 can also occur, e.g. 4 → 3 → 1). So C1 is undecided by the rules, but C2 is definitely True.

Final answer: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (so the current state has event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event2 → either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1 → event2 must happen.
- After event4 → either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event3 → either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event5 → either event2 or event3 must happen.
(One of the event5 rules is repeated but identical.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event4 does not happen” — i.e., in the state under consideration, event4 is false (¬event4).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, event4 does not happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and the conclusion
- We start in a state where event4 has just happened.
- The rule “After event4 → either event3 or event5 must happen” dictates what occurs in the next state. That means the next state must be event3 or event5 (not event4).
- Therefore in the next state event4 does not occur, so C1 is true in the next state. Hence C2 is True.

Note on interpretation: this conclusion assumes the usual “next event is one of …” reading of “either/or” (i.e., a single next event chosen from the options). If instead the rules allowed simultaneous occurrence of multiple events (so event3 and event4 could both occur next), then C2 would not be guaranteed. Under the normal sequential interpretation, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: we start in a state where event4 happened. The rule ""After event4 → either event3 or event5 must happen"" means the next state is event3 or event5 (not event4). Thus ""event4 does not happen"" holds in the next state, so C2 is True (assuming the usual sequential interpretation of ""either/or"")."

Step 2 — transition rules

- From event1: terminal (no further events).
- From event3: next must be event2, event4, or event5.
- From event4: next must be event1.
- From event5: next must be event1, event3, or event4.

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (Logical disjunction: either event2 occurs (at some point) OR event3 eventually occurs.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- Is C1 guaranteed? No. From the initial event2 we can choose the transition 2 → 1 and stop; in that run event3 never occurs. So C1 is not inevitably true (it can be false in some executions).
- Is C2 true? Yes. Because event2 has already happened initially, the disjunction ""event2 happens or C1 holds"" is already satisfied. Therefore C2 is true.

(If you meant ""event2 happens again strictly in the future"" rather than ""has happened at all,"" note that such a future occurrence of event2 is not guaranteed either — e.g. 2 → 1 ends — so ""event2 occurs again"" would not be universally true.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (the run starts with event5).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event5, event2 must happen. (5 → 2)
- After event2, event4 must happen. (2 → 4)
- After event4, one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen. (4 → 1 or 3 or 5)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (1 → 2)
- After event3, one of {event1, event4} must happen. (3 → 1 or 4)

So the possible transitions create loops: 5→2→4 and from 4 you may go to 1,3, or 5; 1 leads back to 2→4; 3 goes to 1 or 4.

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (interpreted as: in the run/event sequence, event3 never occurs).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e. (event1 occurs) OR (event3 never occurs).

Step 4 — how they relate; is C2 True or False?
We must check whether, given the rules and the initial event5, C2 is guaranteed (always true), guaranteed false, or indeterminate.

- There are runs where C2 is true:
  - Example A (C2 true because event1 occurs): choose 4 → 1 at the first opportunity.
    Sequence: 5 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → ... (event1 occurs → C2 true).
  - Example B (C2 true because C1 holds): always choose 4 → 5 (never choose 1 or 3).
    Sequence: 5 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 5 → ... (event3 never occurs → C1 true → C2 true).

- There is also a run where C2 is false:
  - Example C (C2 false): always choose 4 → 3 and always choose 3 → 4, so event3 occurs but event1 never does.
    Sequence: 5 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... (event3 occurs → C1 false; event1 never occurs → first disjunct false; thus C2 false).

Conclusion
C2 is not guaranteed by the context — it is satisfiable (true in some allowed runs) and falsifiable (false in others). Therefore you cannot assert C2 as necessarily true; its truth depends on the nondeterministic choices at event4 and event3.

Step 1 — Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (i.e., at the initial moment/event).

Step 2 — Transition rules (given)
- After event1: either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event4: event2 must happen.
- After event5: event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event3: event5 must happen.

Step 3 — What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is a redundant conjunction; syntactically it just says event2 holds (at that moment). If one intended it to mean “event2 happens twice (at two possibly different times)”, we will note that alternate reading below.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" In temporal terms, C2 = F C1, i.e. at some point (possibly now) C1 is true.

Step 4 — How they relate / evaluation
- Because the initial condition states event2 happens right now, C1 (as written) is already true at the initial moment. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true — it holds immediately.
- If instead C1 was intended to mean “event2 occurs twice” (two occurrences at different times), the system also permits a second occurrence: from event2 you can take the branch event5 → event4 → event2 (because after event2 you may go to event5, after event5 must go to event4, and after event4 must go to event2). Thus a later event2 is reachable, so C1 (interpreted as two occurrences) will also eventually be satisfied. 

Conclusion: Under the natural reading of C1, C2 is True (and it remains True even under the “two occurrences” reading because the transition rules allow returning to event2).

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Reason: Initially event3 holds, and the rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 in the next state, so C1 is true. But there is no rule forcing event3 to also hold in that same next state. (After event1, event3 might occur in the following state, but that's one step later.) Therefore the conjunction in C2 is not guaranteed."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event4.
- After event3 → either event1, event2, or event5.
- After event4 → either event2, event3, or event5.
- After event5 → either event2 or event4.
(Several of these were repeated in the statement; these are the unique rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 always happens.” Interpreted as: in every possible execution sequence starting from the initial event1, event5 occurs at some point.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” That is, it is not true that event5 occurs in every possible execution (equivalently: there exists at least one possible execution starting from event1 in which event5 never occurs).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the transitions we can find executions that avoid event5 entirely. For example:
  - Choose 1 → 2, then 2 → 1, then 1 → 2, etc. This yields an infinite sequence 1,2,1,2,... that never visits event5.
  - Similarly 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... also avoids event5.
- Because such a path exists, event5 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible run. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

Final answer: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event5 happened (we start from event5).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
(Interpreting each ""After X, ..."" as a required next-event choice.)
- after event3 → either event1 or event2
- after event1 → either event2 or event3
- after event2 → event1
- after event4 → either event1, event3, or event5
- after event5 → either event1, event2, or event3
(One rule was duplicated: ""after event2, event1 must happen"" appears twice.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event4 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event4 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" means ""Event4 does not happen.""

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / final inference?
- Draw the transition graph (edges are possible next events):
  - 5 → {1,2,3}
  - 1 → {2,3}
  - 2 → {1}
  - 3 → {1,2}
  - 4 → {1,3,5}
- Note: there are no transitions from 1,2,3,5 to event4. The only way to get event4 would be to already be at event4. Starting from the initial event5, no sequence of allowed transitions can reach event4.
- Therefore, given the stated initial condition and rules (no spontaneous/unconstrained occurrences), event4 cannot happen. So C1 is false and C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

(If you allowed arbitrary external occurrences of events outside the ""after"" rules, the answer would be indeterminate; under the usual interpretation that only the given transitions can occur, C2 is True.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1: next must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- After event3: next must be event2.
- After event4: next must be event1.
- After event5: next must be event1.
- After event2: next must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.

(“After X” is taken as the immediate next event.)

Step 3 — meaning of the subconditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event5 will occur — interpreted as a universal implication; given the context it would mean every time event2 occurs event5 must occur later or next.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" So C2 is the disjunction (C1) OR (event3 happens).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- Is C1 true? No. The rules allow a sequence where event2 occurs but event5 never does. For example, starting from the initial event3:
  - event3 (initial) → event2 (forced) → event3 (choose event3 after event2, allowed).
  This cycle 3→2→3→2… never produces event5, so C1 (""event2 implies event5"") is not guaranteed by the rules. Thus C1 is false (not entailed).
- Is C2 true? Yes. C2 = (C1) OR (event3 happens). The initial condition states event3 happened, so the second disjunct is true. Therefore the disjunction C2 is true regardless of C1.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event1, either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen. (stated twice)
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Because event4 happens initially and “after event4 no other events can happen,” the sequence stops immediately after the initial event4. No other events (1,2,3,5) can occur in this scenario.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event5 happens.” (i.e., event1 ∨ event5)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” (i.e., (event1 ∨ event5) ⇒ event1)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth-values
- From the scenario, neither event1 nor event5 occurs (because nothing can occur after the initial event4). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is the implication (event1 ∨ event5) ⇒ event1. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C1 is false here, C2 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the current state/event is event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event5: next is either event1, event3, or event4.  (5 → {1,3,4})
- After event1: next must be event2.                       (1 → 2)
- After event3: next must be event5.                       (3 → 5)
- After event4: next is either event1 or event2.           (4 → {1,2})
- After event2: next is either event3 or event5.           (2 → {3,5})

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state” (i.e., from the current event2, the immediate next event is event4).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens” (i.e., if event4 is the next event, then event1 happens after that).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the current event2, the rules require the next event to be either event3 or event5. Event4 cannot be the immediate next event. So C1 is false (impossible) given the context.
- Now evaluate C2:
  - Logical-entailment view: since C1 is impossible (the context entails ¬C1), the implication “if C1 then event1” is vacuously true. So under strict logical entailment from the given facts, C2 is true.
  - “If C1 were true, would event1 necessarily follow?” (modal/conditional reading): If event4 did occur, the rule after event4 allows either event1 or event2. So event1 is not guaranteed — event2 could happen instead. Under this interpretation, C2 is false (not guaranteed).

Summary answer
- C1 (event4 next) is false given the initial condition and rules.
- C2 is vacuously true as a logical implication (because C1 cannot occur), but C2 is not guaranteed in the counterfactual sense (if event4 did occur, event1 would not necessarily follow).

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event4 happened.

2) Transition rules (restated)
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2: either event4 or event5 must happen next.
- After event3: one of event1, event2, or event5 must happen next.
- After event5: event1 must happen next.
- After event1: either event3 or event4 must happen next.
(You repeated the last two rules in the context; they are the same.)

From the initial state (event4) the next state must be either event2 or event3.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally C1 is the proposition (event2 → event2). This is a propositional tautology: for any truth value of event2, event2 → event2 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In temporal/operator notation this is X(C1) — asking whether C1 is true in the immediate successor state(s).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because C1 is a tautology (p → p), it is true in every state, regardless of which event actually occurs there.
- The next state(s) from the initial state are event2 or event3, but we do not need to use those specifics: in either case C1 is true at that next state because C1 is always true.
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is true.

Note: This conclusion assumes the usual interpretation that C1 is a state formula evaluated in a state; under that standard reading C1 is trivially true everywhere. If you intended a different temporal reading of C1 (e.g., relating occurrence at different times), state that interpretation and we can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is the tautology (event2 → event2), so it holds in every state. Therefore it holds in the next state as well, so C2 is True."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the run starts with event2).

2) Transition rules (consolidated)
- After event2 → either event1 or event5.
- After event1 → either event2 or event4.
- After event4 → event3.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- After event5 → no further events (terminal).
(Notes: two lines in the problem were duplicated; I have merged them.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Interpreting this as: in the whole run (from the given initial state forward) there is some point at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds."" That is, in any run in which event5 occurs at some time, event2 occurs at some time in that run.

4) How they relate / reasoning
- Because the initial condition already says event2 happened at the start of the run, C1 is true for every run (event2 has already occurred).
- An implication ""if event5 happens then C1"" is thus true whenever C1 is true unconditionally. So C2 is true.
- (Alternate view: any run that reaches event5 must include some preceding events consistent with the transition rules; since the run began with event2, event2 is present in the run regardless of whether event5 later occurs.)

Edge-case clarification
- If you intended C1 to mean “event2 happens sometime strictly after the moment when event5 happens” (i.e., after event5 there will still be an event2), then C2 would be false: event5 is terminal, so no events happen after it. But under the usual reading (“there exists some time in the run when event2 occurs”), C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the run starts with event2 already having happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true in every run. An implication ""if event5 happens then C1"" is therefore true whenever C1 holds unconditionally. (If you intended ""event2 happens after event5"" instead of ""at some time in the run,"" then C2 would be false because event5 is terminal.)"

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (we start in the state reached after event5).

2) Transition rules between events (as given)
- After event2 → event1 must happen next.
- After event1 → one of event3, event4, or event5 must happen next.
- After event3 → event1 must happen next.
- After event4 → event1 must happen next.
- After event5 → no other events can happen (event5 is terminal / a sink).

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” (read as “in the considered state, event3 does not occur”.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” i.e. in the state immediately following the current one, it is true that event3 does not happen.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- We start in the state after event5. By the rule “after event5, no other events can happen,” there is no possible next event in that state. In particular, event3 cannot occur in the next state.
- Therefore in the next state the proposition “event3 does not happen” is true. So C1 holds in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Justification: we start in the state reached after event5, which is terminal (no successor states). Therefore there is no next-state in which event3 could occur, so the proposition ""event3 does not happen"" holds in the next state (vacuously)."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (the initial state has event3 true).

2) Transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3: event4 must happen.
- After event4: one of {event1, event5} must happen.
- After event5: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
(Notes: the context repeats some of these rules, but they are the same constraints.)

So, from the initial event3, the next state must be event4 (because ""after event3, event4 must happen"").

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally C1 = (event3 → event3). This is a propositional implication with the same proposition on both sides; it is a tautology (always true) in classical logic: p → p is true whether p is true or false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally C2 = X(C1) (the next-time operator applied to C1). It asserts that in the immediate successor state the formula C1 is true.

(There are no other C3, etc., in the hypothesis you gave.)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 is a tautology, so it holds in every state of the system (including the initial state and every successor).
- Therefore C2 — the claim that C1 holds in the next state — is true. Concretely, from the initial event3 the next state is event4, and in that state C1 (event3 → event3) is still true.

Thus C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the current/initial state is one where event2 occurred).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: event2 must happen.
- After event4: either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event5: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event2 or event5 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event4 happens.” (a proposition about a state)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: in the immediate successor state after the initial state, C1 is true.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- The initial state has event2. By the rule “after event2, either event1 or event4 must happen,” the immediate next state must satisfy (event1 OR event4). That is exactly C1. Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.
- (This holds whether you read “next state” existentially or universally: every allowed successor of the initial state satisfies event1 OR event4.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the initial state has event2, and the transition rule ""after event2: either event1 or event4 must happen"" forces every immediate successor state to satisfy (event1 OR event4), i.e. C1. Hence C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True."

Counterexample: start with initial event5, then choose 4 (5 -> 4), then 2 (4 -> 2), then 3 (2 -> 3).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (the sequence starts at event3).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event1 ⇒ event2 must happen.       (1 → 2)
- After event2 ⇒ either event3 or event5.  (2 → {3,5})
- After event3 ⇒ one of event1, event2, event4, or event5.  (3 → {1,2,4,5})
- After event5 ⇒ either event1 or event4.  (5 → {1,4})
- After event4 ⇒ event2 must happen.       (4 → 2)

(Notes: the statements about 5→{1,4} and 4→2 were repeated in the context; they are the same rules.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting this as: in every possible continuation from the initial state, event2 occurs (i.e., event2 inevitably occurs at some point on every path).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event4 happens.” Interpreting this as: assuming event2 is inevitable (C1), event4 must also inevitably occur on every path.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- We check whether assuming C1 (event2 inevitably occurs) forces event4 to occur in every possible run. It does not.
- Counterexample (a valid infinite run consistent with the rules that satisfies C1 but never includes event4):
  - Start: event3 (given).
  - Choose event2 (allowed by 3 → {1,2,4,5}).
  - From event2 choose event3 (allowed by 2 → {3,5}).
  - Repeat: 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... forever.
  - This run contains event2 (indeed repeatedly), so it satisfies C1, but it never includes event4.
- Another valid loop avoiding event4 is 3 → 2 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 5 → 1 → ... (2→5, 5→1, 1→2), also never visiting event4.

Conclusion
- C2 is False: C1 does not imply event4 must happen.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the start at event3, event2 is inevitable (every immediate choice from 3 either is 2 or leads to 2 next), so C1 holds. But there are valid runs that never visit event4 (for example 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → …), so even assuming C1, event4 need not occur. Hence C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (so we are now at the state immediately after event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event4 → either event1 or event5.
- After event1 → either event3 or event5.
- After event5 → either event1 or event4.
- After event3 → either event2 or event5.
- After event2 → event3 (mandatory).

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” Interpreting “next state” as the state immediately following the current one (i.e., immediately after the initial event2).
- C2: “If event3 happens, then C1 holds.” In other words, whenever event3 occurs (at the relevant point), that implies event4 occurs in the next state.

Step 4 — reasoning and conclusion
- From the rule “after event2 → event3”, the next state after the given initial event2 must be event3. So C1 (that event4 happens next) is false: the next event cannot be event4 because it must be event3.
- For C2: if event3 happens, the system requires after event3 either event2 or event5. Neither of those forces event4 immediately next:
  - If 3 → 2, then the next event is event2 (not event4), so C1 would be false.
  - If 3 → 5, then the next event is event5; after event5 the choice is {event1, event4}, so event4 might happen later but is not guaranteed immediately after the 3 → 5 step. C1 requires event4 immediately in the next state, which is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 is false: there are allowed traces where event3 occurs but the next state is not event4 (e.g., 2 → 3 → 2 ...).

Final answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
C2 is False.

Counterexample: from the initial event2 we have 2 → 3, and after event3 the system may go 3 → 2, so event4 does not necessarily occur immediately after event3. Thus ""if event3 happens then event4 happens next"" is not guaranteed."

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition and the rules: because event1 has happened and after event1 event5 must happen, event5 is guaranteed to occur immediately next (or at least it must occur). So C1 is true right away.
- If C1 is already true now, then “eventually C1” (C2) is also true. (Also note the temporal identity F(F p) = F p — nesting “eventually” does not change the truth value.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules (after X → one of {...})
- After event1 → {event3, event4, event5}
- After event2 → {event1, event5}
- After event3 → {event2, event4, event5}
- After event4 → {event2, event5}
- After event5 → {event2, event4}

(Notice the “after event5” rule is repeated in the context; it is the same rule.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “If event3 happens, then event3 happens.” This is the propositional implication event3 → event3. That formula is a tautology (always true whenever interpreted): any proposition implies itself.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreting “eventually” as the temporal operator F (there exists some future moment where the formula holds), C2 asserts F(C1): at some point in time C1 is true.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- C1 is a logical tautology; it is true immediately (and at every time). Therefore C1 already holds now and at all times.
- Consequently, “C1 eventually holds” is true as well (it holds immediately, so it certainly holds at some future/ present time).

Therefore C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start at event3).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
(Reading the context and removing duplicates)
- From event3 you must go to one of {event1, event4, event5}.
- From event1 you must go to one of {event3, event5}.
- From event4 you must go to one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- From event2 you must go to event3.
- From event5 you must go to event3.

So the directed transition graph is:
3 -> {1,4,5}
1 -> {3,5}
4 -> {1,2,3}
2 -> {3}
5 -> {3}

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this as a universal claim over all possible executions starting from the initial state: in every possible run/trace event2 occurs (at least once, eventually).
- C2: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreting as: in every run where event4 occurs at some point, event2 will then necessarily occur (i.e., after that point event2 will occur in every continuation, or equivalently every run that contains an event4 also contains an event2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / evaluation?
- Is C1 true? No. Counterexample: start at the initial event3 and repeatedly choose the 3->1->3->1... cycle. Explicit trace: 3,1,3,1,3,1,... This trace never contains event2, so event2 does not always happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- Is C2 true? No. C2 claims that whenever event4 happens, event2 must occur (in that run). But we can give a concrete counterexample run that contains event4 but never contains event2. For example:
  - 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... 
  After taking 3->4 we choose 4->1, then 1->3, then repeatedly 3->1->3... This run contains event4 but never contains event2. That shows C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (because C1 is false and because there are runs where event4 occurs but event2 never occurs).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample trace: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Initial condition: Event5 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules

- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3: one of {event2, event5} must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.
- After event5: one of {event2, event3} must happen.

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — read as “event1 never occurs in the run.”
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" — i.e. (event1 never occurs) OR (event3 occurs at some point).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- Starting from the initial event5, choices are nondeterministic. There is a possible run 5 → 2 → 1:
  - 5 followed by 2 (allowed), then 2 followed by 1 (allowed), and 1 is terminal.
  - In this run event1 does occur, so C1 is false, and event3 never occurs, so the disjunction in C2 is false.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed/valid given the rules and initial condition — there exists a counterexample run that makes C2 false.

(Several of these were repeated in the context; the list above is the unique set of rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted naturally, this means a global (universal) property: at every point in the execution/timeline event1 holds (i.e., event1 is true at all times).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" That is: whenever event1 occurs at some point, it implies the global property C1 (i.e., that event1 holds always).

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation of C2
- Because the initial state is event4, C1 (""event1 always happens"") is already false for any full trace: at time 0 the event is event4, not event1, so event1 does not hold at all times.
- To show C2 false we need a trace where the antecedent (event1 happens sometime) is true while the consequent (C1) is false. Such a trace exists under the rules: for example
  - step0: event4 (initial),
  - step1: event1 (allowed after event4),
  - step2: event2 (allowed after event1).
  In that trace event1 does occur (antecedent true) but C1 is false (because step0 was event4, so event1 is not true at all times). Therefore the implication in C2 is false in that trace.
- Conclusion: C2 is False.

Remark: if someone meant ""C1: event1 happens at least once"" rather than ""always"", the truth values change; but with the ordinary reading ""always"", C2 is false as shown.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: t0 = event4 (initial), t1 = event1 (allowed after event4), t2 = event2 (allowed after event1). Here event1 does occur (antecedent true) but C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false (t0 ≠ event1), so the implication C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has already occurred (we start in a state after event5).

2) Transition rules (what may happen after each event):
- After event3 → event1 (must).
- After event1 → one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3}.
- After event4 → one of {event2, event3, event5}.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event4}. (This line was repeated but means the same choice.)

3) What the conditions mean:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (This is ambiguous in natural language. Two useful readings:)
  a) Strong/global reading: at every time step the event that occurs is event2. This is immediately false because initially event5 occurred.
  b) Inevitable/eventual reading (typical in branching/temporal reasoning): in every possible future/run, event2 will occur at some point. I'll use this more useful interpretation below.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" This is the propositional OR of C1 with the claim that event5 happens (we already know event5 has happened initially).

4) How they relate / evaluation:
- C1 (under the eventual/inevitable reading) is false. Counterexample run: start at the initial event5, choose event1 after event5, then choose event4 after event1, then choose event5 after event4, then repeat: 5 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 4 → ... . All chosen transitions are allowed, and this infinite run never contains event2, so event2 is not inevitable.
- Because the initial condition states event5 already happened, the second disjunct of C2 (""event5 happens"") is true. Therefore C2 = (C1 or event5 happens) is true regardless of C1 being false.

If you intended a different formal meaning for ""always"" or for ""event5 happens"" (e.g., ""happens now"" vs. ""eventually happens in every run""), say so and I can re-evaluate under that exact semantics.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initially event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event4 → {event1, event3}
- After event1 → {event2, event3, event4}
- After event3 → {event1, event2, event4}
- After event2 → {event3, event4}
- After event5 → {event1, event3, event4}
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the text; these are the distinct rules.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 does not happen” — i.e., in the run starting from the initial state, event5 never occurs.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — i.e., in every possible future (every allowed run from the initial state), event5 never occurs.

4) How they relate / reasoning
- Start from event3. From event3 the allowed next events are {1,2,4}, so reachable set S = {3} ∪ {1,2,4} = {1,2,3,4}.
- From those (1,2,4) their successors are:
  - 1 → {2,3,4}
  - 2 → {3,4}
  - 4 → {1,3}
  All of these stay inside {1,2,3,4}. Closing under transitions, the set of reachable events is {1,2,3,4}.
- There is no transition rule that yields event5 from any event in {1,2,3,4}. The only rule mentioning event5 is what happens after event5 (its successors), but that does not make event5 reachable.
- Therefore event5 is unreachable from the initial event3, so event5 never happens in any allowed run.

Conclusion
- C1 is true (event5 does not happen).
- C2 is true (C1 holds in all possible futures).
So C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has already happened (every trace starts with event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (what can follow what)
- After event5: no further events (event5 is terminal).
- After event1: event4 must happen next.
- After event4: either event1 or event3 happens next.
- After event3: either event1, event2, or event5 happens next.
- After event2: either event1, event3, event4, or event5 happens next.

As a small transition graph (successors):
- 4 → {1, 3}
- 1 → {4}
- 3 → {1, 2, 5}
- 2 → {1, 3, 4, 5}
- 5 → ∅

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens"" — there exists a future point in the execution where event5 occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" — read as the implication: if event5 occurs at some point in the execution, then event4 occurs at some point in the execution. (Note: this is the natural reading; an alternative reading would be ""after event5, event4 happens"", which explicitly requires event4 to occur after event5. I discuss that alternate reading below.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- Under the natural reading of C2 (event4 occurs at some point in the trace): C2 is True. Reason: event4 already happened initially in every trace (given the initial condition), so in every execution where C1 holds event4 also holds (it already occurred). Thus C1 ⇒ event4 is satisfied trivially.
- Under the alternate reading ""if event5 happens then event4 happens afterwards"": C2 would be False. Reason: event5 is terminal (no events after event5), so nothing (including event4) can occur after event5.

Summary answer to your direct question: C2 is True if interpreted as ""there exists an event4 somewhere in the execution"" (the usual existential “event4 happens”); C2 is False if interpreted as ""event4 happens after event5.""

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: under the natural reading (""event4 occurs somewhere in the trace""), every trace already starts with event4, so whenever event5 eventually happens the trace contains event4. (If one instead reads C2 as ""event4 occurs after event5"", that would be False because event5 is terminal.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event5 happens at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (cleaned up, duplicates removed)
- After event5: either event1 or event2 must happen. (5 -> {1,2})
- After event2: either event3, event4, or event5 must happen. (2 -> {3,4,5})
- After event3: event1 must happen. (3 -> {1})
- After event1: either event3 or event4 must happen. (1 -> {3,4})
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event5 must happen. (4 -> {1,2,5})

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Interpreting this in the standard way: in every possible execution (starting from the initial event5), event3 occurs at least once (i.e., event3 is inevitable).
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” That is, there exists at least one valid execution starting from the initial state in which event3 never occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; decide C2
- We only need one valid execution that avoids event3 to show C1 is false and therefore C2 true.
- Construct such an execution: start at 5, choose transition 5 -> 2. From 2 choose 2 -> 5. From 5 choose 5 -> 2, and so on. This yields an infinite valid sequence 5,2,5,2,5,2,... that never contains event3 (each step respects the transition rules).
- Therefore C1 (event3 is inevitable) is false, and C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the timeline starts with event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event2: event4 must happen.
- After event3: event5 must happen.
- After event4: event2 must happen. (stated twice; redundant)
- After event5: event2 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (i.e., event1 never occurs in the timeline)
- C2: “If event4 happens, then C1 holds.” Equivalently: “If event4 occurs, then event1 does not occur (anywhere in the timeline).”

Step 4 — how the rules imply (or do not imply) C2
- From the initial event2 and the “must happen” rules we get a forced sequence: event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → … (a 2↔4 cycle). Every time event2 occurs it must be followed by event4, and every event4 must be followed by event2. No rule allows transitioning from 2 or 4 to event1 (or to any event that would lead to event1).
- The only way to reach event3 or event5 is via event1 → event3 → event5 → event2, but event1 never appears in the forced 2→4→2→4… trace.
- Therefore, in every timeline consistent with the given initial condition and transition rules, event1 does not occur. So C1 is true in all reachable histories.
- Consequently, the implication “if event4 happens then event1 does not happen” holds (because event4 does happen in the reachable trace, and event1 never does). Thus C2 is true.

(If you allowed a different interpretation where event1 could arbitrarily occur despite the “after” rules, the answer could change. Under the usual reading that the given “after … must happen” constraints determine the possible traces starting from the given initial event2, C2 is True.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: Starting from event2 the rules force the cycle 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → …; no rule ever leads to event1, so event1 never occurs (C1 is true). Hence ""if event4 happens then event1 does not happen"" is true (C2 holds)."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initially: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1: next must be one of {event2, event3, event5}.
- After event2: next must be event5.
- After event3: next must be one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- After event5: terminal (no further events).
- After event4: terminal (but event4 is never shown as reachable from the initial state).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Meaning: in every possible allowed sequence of events (starting from the initial event1 and following the rules), event2 occurs at some point.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Equivalently: there exists at least one allowed sequence in which event2 does not occur.

4) Relation and evaluation
- From the rules, there are allowed traces where event2 never occurs. For example:
  - Choose event5 immediately after event1: trace 1 → 5 (terminal). Event2 never occurs.
  - Or keep cycling 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (always choosing event3 then event1): an infinite trace that never includes event2 or event5.
- Because such traces are allowed, event2 is not guaranteed to occur in every possible run. Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Counterexamples: from initial 1 you can go 1→5 (terminal) or loop 1→3→1→3→... — both are allowed traces that never include event2. Thus event2 does not always happen (C1 is false), so C2 is true."

Step 1 — Events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (so we consider the state immediately after event4).

Step 2 — Transition rules (after each event)
- After event4: either event3 or event5 must happen (so the next event is in {event3, event5}).
- After event3: next event must be in {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- After event5: next event must be in {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event1: next event must be in {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2: no other events can happen.
(Notes: the context repeats some rules but they are the same and do not change the immediate-next-state constraint after event4.)

Step 3 — What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" That claims the event immediately following the initial event4 is event4.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true iff C1 is false.

Step 4 — How they relate and final evaluation
- Because we start after event4, the transition rule ""After event4, either event3 or event5 must happen"" restricts the next event to {event3, event5}. Event4 is not among the allowed next events.
- Therefore C1 (""event4 happens next"") is false.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: After the initial event4, the next event must be event3 or event5, so C1 (""event4 happens next"") is false; therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (it is given to have occurred initially).

Step 2 — transition rules (from the context)
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event4 must happen. (this rule appears twice but is the same)
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen. (this rule also appears twice)
- After event5, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event5 happens"" (i.e., event3 ∧ event5).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens"" (i.e., (event3 ∧ event5) ∨ event4).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- We are given that event4 happened initially, so the disjunct ""event4"" in C2 is true.
- Therefore C2 = (event3 ∧ event5) ∨ event4 is true regardless of whether C1 (event3 ∧ event5) is true or false.
- Note: C1 is not guaranteed by the rules (there is no rule forcing event5 to occur), so C1 may be false — but that does not affect C2 because event4 already makes C2 true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreting each “after X, either … must happen” as: the next event must be one of the listed options)
- After event1: next ∈ {event2, event5}.
- After event2: next ∈ {event1, event3, event4}. (This rule was stated twice but is the same rule.)
- After event3: next = event5. (stated twice, same rule.)
- After event4: next ∈ {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event5: next ∈ {event1, event2, event3}. (stated twice, same rule.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 happens and event3 happens.” Interpreted as: at some points in the future both event3 and event5 occur (not necessarily in any order).
- C2: “If event4 happens, then C1 holds.” Interpreted as a universal implication: whenever event4 occurs (at some time), then (in all possible continuations compatible with the rules) both event3 and event5 will occur afterwards.

Step 4 — relation and verdict
- From event2 you can directly go to event4 (since event2 → {1,3,4}). So there are executions where event4 happens.
- To show C2 false it suffices to exhibit a valid continuation after event4 in which either event3 or event5 (or both) never occur.
  Example counterexample trace:
  - Start: event2 (initial).
  - Choose event4 next (allowed by event2 → {1,3,4}).
  - After event4 choose event2 (allowed by event4 → {1,2,3}).
  - After event2 choose event1 (allowed by event2 → {1,3,4}).
  - After event1 choose event2 (choose 1 → 2 instead of 1 → 5).
  - Repeat the cycle event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … indefinitely.
  This infinite run is allowed by the rules and never produces event3 nor event5.
- Because such a valid continuation exists after event4 that avoids both event3 and event5, C1 does not necessarily follow from event4. Therefore C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (this is the current state).

2) Transition rules (what may happen immediately after each event)
- After event5 → either event3 or event4.
- After event3 → either event1, event2, or event5.
- After event4 → either event1, event2, or event3.
- After event1 → either event2, event4, or event5.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, event4, or event5.

(There are some repeated lines in the problem statement, but they restate the same transitions.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreted as: in the considered state, event2 is not the event that occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted as: in the state immediately following the current state (i.e., the next event after the current one), event2 does not occur.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Current state: event5 happened.
- The transition rule for event5 requires the next event to be either event3 or event4.
- Neither event3 nor event4 is event2, so in every possible next state (given the rule) event2 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is true.

Note: This does not rule out event2 happening later (after the next state); it only establishes that event2 does not occur in the immediate next state.

Short answer: C2 is True (under the natural reading below). Now the step‑by‑step reasoning you asked for.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition given: initially event2 happened.
- Also given: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 occurs (and it occurs initially), the execution/trace ends — no further events occur.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event5 → next must be event1 or event4.
- After event1 → next must be event3 or event4 or event5.
- After event4 → next must be event1. (stated twice)
- After event3 → next must be event1.
- After event2 → no other events can happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Natural formal reading: in every possible execution/trace of the system, event2 occurs (i.e., every trace contains an occurrence of event2).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Read as: the property C1 is true (globally) — equivalently, in every execution it is the case that event2 occurs.

(If one instead reads ""always"" as “at every time instant” rather than “in every trace at some point”, the meaning becomes different; I address that subtlety at the end.)

4) How they relate and conclusion
- The model fixes the initial event to be event2 and forbids any further events after event2. Therefore every allowed execution contains event2 (indeed contains only event2).
- Hence C1 (every execution contains event2) is true.
- If C1 is true, the statement ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also true — there is no execution where C1 fails.

Therefore C2 is True under the natural trace-based reading.

Note on the alternative reading: if ""event2 always happens"" were interpreted to mean ""at every instant/state event2 is currently happening"" (an instantaneous event that would have to hold continuously), then that reading would be problematic because events are typically instantaneous and cannot hold at every future instant. Under that instantaneous-state interpretation, C1 would be ill-posed or false, and so C2 would be false. But with the usual interpretation used in event/trace specifications (every trace contains event2), C2 is True.

I'll answer each question step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition given: event5 happened (i.e., event5 is true).

2) Transition rules (written as implications)
- After event3, event4 must happen: event3 → event4.
- After event4, event1 must happen: event4 → event1.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen: event1 → (event2 ∨ event4).
- After event2, event1 must happen: event2 → event1.
- After event5, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen: event5 → (event1 ∨ event2 ∨ event4).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally C1 is event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology (A → A), so C1 is always true in classical logic regardless of which events actually occur.
- C2: ""Event5 happens and C1 holds."" Formally C2 is event5 ∧ C1. C2 is true exactly when event5 is true and C1 is true.

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation
- C1 is always true (tautology).
- The initial condition states event5 happened, so event5 is true.
- Therefore event5 ∧ C1 is true. Hence C2 is True.

Note: The other transition rules are irrelevant to the truth of C1 (which is tautological) and to C2 here, because we already have event5 true and C1 true. If you meant a different reading of C1 (e.g., a nontrivial property about event2), say so and I can re-evaluate.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (from each event, which events may follow)
- After event2 → {event1, event3, event4}
- After event1 → {event2, event3, event4, event5}
- After event3 → {event2, event5}
- After event4 → {event2}
- After event5 → {event1, event2, event3, event4}
(Several rules were repeated in the statement but they give the same sets above.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event4 happens."" Formally: event4 → event4. This is a logical tautology (an instance of A → A), so C1 is true in every state regardless of which event actually occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether in the state immediately following the current one, C1 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation of C2
- From the initial state (event3), the next state must be either event2 or event5 (by the rule for event3).
- In either of those next states (or in any state), C1 remains true because C1 is a tautology (A → A is always true).
- Therefore C1 does hold in every next state, so C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is the formula event4 → event4, which is a logical tautology and therefore true in every state. Hence in any next state C1 still holds, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (i.e., the current state is one where event1 has just occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: either event3 or event5 happens next.
- After event2: either event1, event3, or event5 happens next.
- After event3: either event2, event4, or event5 happens next.
- After event4: event2 must happen next.
- After event5: either event1, event2, event3, or event4 happens next.

(Notes: the context repeats some rules but these are the distinct transitions.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (i.e., immediately after the current state.)
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens.” Interpreting this consistently in the same temporal scope, C2 means: (event2 happens next) OR (event1 happens next).

Step 4 — relate conditions and conclude
- We start in a state where event1 just happened. By the rule “after event1,” the next event must be either event3 or event5. Therefore the next event cannot be event2 and cannot be event1.
- So C1 (event2 next) is false.
- Consequently C2 (event2 next OR event1 next) is also false.

(If instead “event1 happens” in C2 were intended to mean “event1 happened in the current/previous state,” then C2 would be true because event1 did initially happen. But with the usual reading that both disjuncts refer to the next state, C2 is false.)

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (we start right after an occurrence of event5).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: next must be event3 or event4.
- After event2: next must be event1 or event3 or event4.
- After event3: next must be event2 or event4 or event5.
- After event4: next must be event3. (This rule appears twice in the statement; it’s the same rule.)
- After event5: next must be event1 or event2 or event3.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens."" (a propositional condition: at some point an occurrence of event2 or event3 holds.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (a temporal statement: along the execution starting from the initial state, at some future step C1 is true — i.e., eventually we see event2 or event3.)

4) How they relate and why C2 is true
- From the initial event5, the next event must be one of {1,2,3}.
  - If it is event2 or event3, C1 already holds immediately.
  - If it is event1, then the next event must be 3 or 4. If it is 3, C1 holds; if it is 4, then after 4 the next event is forced to be 3, so C1 holds (on that next step).
- Therefore, in every possible branch starting from the initial event5, event2 or event3 occurs within at most two steps. So C1 will occur, and thus C2 (""eventually C1"") is true.

Reason: Starting from the initial event1, repeatedly choose event4 after event1 and then event1 after event4 (1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ...).

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we are at a state immediately after event1).

2) Transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event3 → event1 must happen next.
- After event1 → either event3 or event4 must happen next.
- After event4 → either event1, event2, or event5 must happen next.
- After event2 → no events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event5 → event4 must happen next.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — i.e., the immediate next event after the current (initial) state is event2.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state.

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- Because we start after event1, the rule “After event1 → either event3 or event4 must happen next” applies. The next event must be event3 or event4; event2 is not allowed as the immediate next event.
- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

(If by “next” you instead meant “eventually sometime in the future,” event2 could occur later via event1 → event4 → event2. But under the usual reading of “next state” = immediately next event, C2 is True.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened initially.

2) Transition rules (collected and deduplicated)
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3}.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event4, event5}.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3, event5}.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event4}.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event5 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual (strong) sense: at every time step the event that occurs is event5 (i.e., event5 occurs at every subsequent step).
  (Notes: the phrase could be ambiguous — it might instead mean ""event5 occurs infinitely often"" or ""in every possible execution event5 occurs eventually/infinitely often"". I address those variants below.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = the negation of C1.

4) How they relate / which is true
- From the transition rule after event5, the next event must be event1 or event4. In particular, event5 → event5 is not allowed. Therefore event5 cannot occur at two consecutive steps.
- If C1 means ""event5 occurs at every step"", that is impossible because immediately after any event5 the next event cannot be event5. So C1 is false and C2 is true.
- If C1 were intended as ""event5 occurs infinitely often"" then C1 can be true in some executions (for example the infinite sequence 5,1,5,1,5,... is allowed), but C1 as a universal claim ""event5 always (in every execution) occurs infinitely often"" would still be false because there exist executions that avoid event5 after the initial one (e.g. 5 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 ... never returning to 5). Thus under the natural universal reading C1 is false and C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 (""event5 always happens"" meaning event5 at every step) is impossible because the rule after event5 requires the next event be event1 or event4, so event5 cannot occur consecutively. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (its negation) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is given as a fact).

Step 2 — transition rules and immediate consequences
- After event2 → either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1 → event4 must happen.
- After event3 → either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event4 → either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event5 → either event1 or event2 must happen.
(One of the ""after event5"" lines was repeated; they are the same rule.)

Immediate consequence of the initial condition:
- Since event1 happened initially, event4 must happen (by the rule “after event1 → event4”).
- After that event4 → either event2 or event5. So from the initial event1 we get a branching future: either event2 will happen next (1 → 4 → 2 …) or event5 will happen next (1 → 4 → 5 …). Further branching follows from the other rules, so multiple continuations are possible.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event2 happens and event4 happens.” This is true only if both event2 and event4 occur (at some point).
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens.” So C2 is true if either (a) both event2 and event4 occur, or (b) event1 occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- We know event1 happened initially. Therefore the second disjunct of C2 (“event1 happens”) is already true.
- An OR is true if any disjunct is true, so C2 is true, regardless of whether C1 is true or false.
- (For completeness: C1 is not guaranteed by the rules — event4 is guaranteed by the initial event1, but event2 is only one of the possible outcomes after event4 (the other is event5). So C1 may or may not hold depending on the nondeterministic choices. But C2 is definitely true because event1 occurred.)

Final answer: C2 is True.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is, C2 asserts that C1 is false / not entailed by the rules.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- The rule for after event4 allows event1, event3, or event5. That means event5 is one possible successor but not the required one.
- Concrete counterexample showing C1 fails: start with the given initial event4, then pick event1 as the next event (allowed). After event1 we may pick event4 again (allowed). This yields a sequence event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... that never includes event5. Thus it is not true that every occurrence of event4 is followed by event5.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so every allowed run/trace starts with event2).

2) Transition rules (possible next events after a given event)
- After event5: next is either event1 or event3 (5 -> {1,3}).
- After event1: next is either event2, event3, or event4 (1 -> {2,3,4}).
- After event2: next must be event1 (2 -> {1}).
- After event3: no further events can happen (3 is terminal).
- After event4: next is either event1 or event5 (4 -> {1,5}).

(“After event3, no other events can happen” was repeated in the problem statement.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event5 always happens.” Interpreting this as: in every possible run (starting from the initial event2) event5 occurs at some point. (If you prefer a different formal reading, tell me and I can re-evaluate.)
- C2: “If event4 happens, then C1 holds.” Reading this as: whenever a run contains event4, it must be that event5 occurs in every run (i.e., event5 is guaranteed thereafter / in that run). Practically: from any run that includes event4, event5 must occur in every allowed continuation.

4) How the conditions relate and final assessment
- C1 is false: there is a possible run that never reaches event5. Example: 2 -> 1 -> 3. From the initial event2 you must go to 1, and from 1 you may choose 3; 3 is terminal. That run contains no event5, so event5 is not guaranteed in every run.
- C2 is false: even if event4 occurs in a run, event5 is not guaranteed afterwards. Counterexample run starting from the initial condition:
  2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3.
  This run contains event4 but never contains event5 (after 4 we chose 1, then from 1 chose 3 and stopped). Thus the antecedent “event4 happens” can be true while C1 (that event5 always happens) is false. Therefore C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

False

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition given: initially event5 happened (the current/initial state is labeled event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (as stated)
- After event3, either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event4, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event5, event4 must happen. (stated twice; redundant)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2, event3, event4, or event5 must happen.

(Interpretation: “either A or B must happen” means one of those listed must occur next, but it does not force which one — nondeterministic choice among the listed options.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event5 happens in the next state.” (a claim about what the immediate next event is)
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” In plain terms: whenever the current state is event1, the next state is event5.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C2
- From the rule for event1, the next event after event1 must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}. That set includes event5 but does not force it; event2 (or event3 or event4) is an allowed alternative.
- Therefore the implication “if event1 then next is event5” is not guaranteed by the rules. A concrete counterexample: take a state where event1 occurs; choose event2 as the allowed next event (per the rule). Then the next event is event2, not event5, so C1 fails in that case.
- Conclusion: C2 is False (not logically entailed by the given transition rules).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

After event1 the rules allow next = event2, event3, event4, or event5; event5 is only one possibility, not guaranteed. For example, if event1 occurs and the next chosen event is event2, then C1 (""next is event5"") is false, so C2 is not entailed."

- Case B: event4 occurs. The rule ""after event4, event5 must happen"" gives event4 → event5, and then from event5 → event2 we get event4 → event5 → event2. So if event4 occurs, event2 will also occur (afterwards).
- Since both disjuncts of C1 (event4 or event5) lead to event2, the implication C1 → event2 is true.

Note: C1 itself is not guaranteed from the initial condition (there is a possible infinite loop event3 → event2 → event3 → … that avoids event4 and event5), but C2 is a conditional statement and is true whenever C1 holds.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

(Notes: a couple of rules were repeated in the statement; the above is the consolidated set.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as: every execution path that includes event2 eventually leads to event1.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e., C1 is false.

4) How the conditions relate; evaluation
- From the initial event2 we have a forced step: 2 → 5.
- From 5 we may choose 3 or 4.

Construct a counterexample path that satisfies all rules but never reaches event1:
- Choose 5 → 3.
- From 3 choose 2.
- From 2 we must go to 5 again.

So one possible infinite trace is: 2 → 5 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 3 → 2 → ... This trace never reaches event1 and respects all transition rules (choices at 5 and 3 that lead back to 2 are allowed). Because there exists a valid execution starting from event2 that does not lead to event1, C1 is false.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Counterexample trace: 2 → 5 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 3 → … (repeat). This respects all transition rules and never reaches event1, so ""every path from event2 reaches event1"" (C1) is false; hence C2 is True."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (call this state s0).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event3, one of {event2, event5} must happen.
- After event5, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at a state X, C1 means that in the immediate successor state of X, event4 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted at a state X, C2 means that in X's immediate successor state Y, the proposition C1 is true (i.e., in Y's successor state Z, event4 occurs).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Start at s0 where event1 has happened. By the rule ""after event1, event4 must happen,"" the immediate successor s1 must be a state where event4 happens. Thus C1 is true at s0.
- C2 at s0 asks whether C1 is true at s1, i.e. whether event4 happens in the successor of s1. But s1 is a state where event4 has just happened, and the rule ""after event4, no other events can happen"" makes s1 terminal — there is no next event/state in which event4 could occur. Therefore C1 is false at s1, and so C2 is false at s0.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If instead “after” were intended to mean “eventually” rather than “in the immediate next state,” the answers could change; under the standard next-state reading used above, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From s0 (event1) the next state s1 must be event4, so C1 is true at s0. But event4 is terminal (no successor), so in s1 there is no next state where event4 could occur; C1 is false at s1. Thus C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false at s0."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events = {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event5 has occurred at the start.

2) Transition rules (compact form)
- After event1 → next ∈ {event3, event4, event5}
- After event2 → next ∈ {event1, event3, event4, event5}
- After event3 → next ∈ {event4, event5}
- After event4 → next ∈ {event1, event5}
- After event5 → next ∈ {event3, event4}

(Several rules in the problem were repetitions of the above.)

Note: event2 is never reached from any other event in these rules (no incoming edge to event2), so runs starting at event5 will never visit event2.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (i.e., along the execution from the initial state, there is some time at which event1 occurs.)
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” (a conditional: whenever event1 occurs, C1 is true for that run.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Is C1 true (inevitable)? No. There exist valid runs that never hit event1: for example repeatedly choose the transitions 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → ... (from 5 you may pick 3, from 3 you may pick 5). That infinite run respects the rules and never visits event4 or event1, so event1 does not eventually happen. Therefore C1 is false (not guaranteed).
- Is C2 true? Yes. C2 is logically true: if event1 occurs at some point in the run, then by that occurrence event1 has indeed “eventually happened,” so C1 holds for that run. More formally, the statement (event1 happens) ⇒ (event1 eventually happens) is a tautology in this setting (it is true vacuously when event1 never happens, and true non-vacuously when it does). Note that C2 being true does not imply C1 — C2 does not prove event1 must occur.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: The statement ""if event1 happens then event1 eventually happens"" is always true (an occurrence of event1 guarantees that it has occurred at some future/past point in the run), so C2 holds."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is given as true).

2) Transition rules (as stated)
- After event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1 → either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event2 → event5 must happen.
- After event5 → either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4 → either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
(You listed the event5 and event4 rules twice; those are redundant repeats of the same rules.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally: event5 ⇒ event3 (i.e., whenever event5 occurs, event3 must occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Formally: C2 = (C1 ∨ event1).

4) Relation and evaluation
- Is C1 true (entailed by the rules)? No — it is not guaranteed. Counterexample path consistent with the rules:
  event1 (initial) → choose event5 (allowed after event1) → choose event4 (allowed after event5) → choose event5 (allowed after event4) → ... 
  This loop (5 → 4 → 5 → ...) never requires event3 to occur, so event5 can happen without event3 occurring. Therefore C1 is false (not necessarily true under the given rules).
- Is C2 true or false? C2 is (C1 ∨ event1). We know event1 is true from the initial condition, so the disjunction is true regardless of C1’s truth value. Therefore C2 is True.

Conclusion: C1 is not guaranteed (false as a necessary implication); C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 is given as true initially, so C2 = (C1 ∨ event1) is true regardless of whether C1 holds."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event5, event2 must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" = (event2 ∨ event1).
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" = (event3 ∨ C1), equivalently (event3 ∨ event2 ∨ event1).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- From (1), event1 is true.
- Therefore C1 = (event2 ∨ event1) is true (because event1 is true).
- Therefore C2 = (event3 ∨ C1) is true (because C1 is true).

You can also check by following the allowed transitions: from the initial event1 you either go to event2 (so event2 is true → C1 true) or to event4 → event3 (so event3 is true). In every possible branch C2 holds.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so we are at the state immediately after event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreting “After X” as the immediate next event)
- After event3 → next must be event4.
- After event4 → next must be event1.
- After event1 → next must be one of {event2, event3, event5}.
- After event2 → next must be one of {event3, event5}.
- After event5 → no further events can happen. (Repeated statement ignored as duplicate.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (Taken as “event1 does not occur in the current state.”)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” In other words, in the state immediately following the current one, event1 does not occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- We start in the state after event2. By the rule for event2, the immediate next event must be either event3 or event5.
- Neither choice is event1, so event1 does not occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (event1 does not happen) is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Note on interpretation: this conclusion assumes “After X” means the immediate next event. If “after” were interpreted looser (e.g., “eventually after”), the answer could differ — but under the usual immediate-next-event interpretation used above, C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has just happened (we are at the state right after event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1 → either event3 or event5.
- After event2 → either event3 or event5.
- After event3 → either event1, event2, or event4.
- After event4 → either event1 or event2.
- After event5 → event1.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens."" (interpreted as: whenever event4 occurs, the next event must be event5.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the state reached immediately after the initial event4, the statement C1 is true there.)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- The system rule for event4 is: after event4 the next event must be either event1 or event2. That directly contradicts C1 (which requires event5 to follow event4). So C1 is false in the current state.
- The transition rules are fixed and do not make event5 the required successor of event4 in any state. Therefore C1 is false in every state, and in particular it does not become true in the next state.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.

Counterexample: start at event5 (allowed). Next take event4 (event5 → event4 is allowed). From event4 you may go to event2 (event4 → event2 is allowed). Thus after event4 the next event can be event2, not event3, so ""if event4 happens then event3 happens in the next state"" is not guaranteed."

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event3 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (what may happen immediately after each event)
- after event1: either event3 or event5
- after event3: either event1 or event2
- after event5: either event1 or event3
- after event2: either event3 or event4
- after event4: either event1 or event5

(These give the allowed continuations but are not needed to evaluate the given C1/C2.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens."" Interpreting this as a plain propositional implication p → p with p = “event5 happens”. That formula is a tautology: for any truth value of p, p → p is true (if p true then p true; if p false the implication is true). So C1 is true in every state/trace if read this way.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Usually this means the formula C1 holds in every state or along every point of every trace (a global/“always” operator). Since C1 is a tautology, it holds at every state, so “always C1” is also true.

4) How they relate and final answer
- C1 is a tautology (always true) irrespective of the transition rules or initial state.
- Therefore C2 (that C1 always holds) is True.

Minor caveat: if you intended a different temporal reading of C1 (for example “if event5 happens now then event5 happens next”), then the truth of C1/C2 would need re-evaluation. Under the plain reading given, C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start in state event3).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event2 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event4 → either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event5 → event4 must happen.

3) Meaning of C1, C2
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens"" (there exists some future step in which event4 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1 (i.e. event4 never happens).

4) How the conditions relate / reachability analysis
- From the initial event3, possible next events are event1 or event2.
- From event2 the only next event is event1.
- From event1 the next is either event2 or event3.
- Thus the reachable set starting from event3 is {event1, event2, event3}. These three form a closed cycle: no rule from 1,2,3 leads to event4 or event5.
- The only rules involving event4 or event5 are:
  - event4 → {event2, event3, event5}
  - event5 → event4
  These show 4 and 5 can lead into the {1,2,3} region, but there is no rule that leads from {1,2,3} into event4 or event5.
- Therefore, starting from the given initial condition (event3), event4 is unreachable: event4 cannot eventually occur in any allowed evolution.

Conclusion: C1 is false, so C2 (¬C1) is true.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event1: next must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2: next must be one of {event1, event5}.
- After event3: no other events can happen (i.e. no outgoing transitions).
- After event4: next must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5}.
- After event5: next must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state.” (A proposition about the next state.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event3 happens.” Formally C2 is the implication C1 → (event3 happens). Since C1 is exactly the proposition “event3 happens in the next state,” C2 is the formula P → P (where P = “event3 happens in the next state”).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the transition rules: because the initial event was event3 and “after event3 no other events can happen,” nothing (including event3) can happen in the next state. So C1 is false in this model.
- C2, however, is the implication P → P. That is a logical tautology (always true): an implication of a statement to itself is true in all cases. More concretely: if C1 were true, the consequent is the same statement, so it would be true; if C1 is false the implication is vacuously true. Either way C2 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event5, event2 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen.

(From the initial event5 and the rules you can already see possible sequences like 5 → 2 → 1 → 4 or loops 5 → 2 → 5 → 2 …)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” Formally: C1 ≡ (event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” Formally: C2 ≡ (C1 → event2).

Step 4 — how they relate; truth of C2
- C1 is the conjunction (event2 ∧ event1). From a conjunction you can always infer either conjunct, so (event2 ∧ event1) → event2 is logically valid.
- Therefore C2 is true (it is a tautological/valid implication given the definition of C1).  
- (As an additional note: independent of C1, the rules also make event2 occur after the initial event5, so event2 happens in the system anyway — but that isn’t needed to conclude C2.)

Answer: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happens (it occurs at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event2 must happen. (This is stated twice but is the same rule.)
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event5 must happen. (Repeated three times; still the same rule.)
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event4, either event1, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event1, event2, event3, or event4 must happen.

(Repeated statements in the context do not change the meaning of the rules.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens."" This is a disjunction: at least one of event2 or event3 occurs (somewhere in the timeline).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" That is, C1 is true AND event3 happens (so event3 must happen and at least one of event2 or event3 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true?
- Because the initial condition says event3 happens, the disjunction in C1 is immediately satisfied (event3 is true), so C1 holds.
- C2 requires C1 AND that event3 happens. Since event3 does indeed happen initially, both parts are satisfied.
- Therefore C2 is True.

(As additional confirmation: the rules also force event2 to occur after event3, so there are sequences like event3 → event2 → event3 → …, but you do not need those extra steps to conclude C2 true because event3 already occurred initially.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event3 occurs initially, so C1 (""event2 or event3 happens"") is satisfied, and event3 itself holds; therefore C2 (C1 and event3) is true."

- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts at event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3: one of {event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event2: one of {event1, event3} must happen.
- After event4: one of {event1, event2} must happen.
- After event5: event1 must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event4, event5} must happen. (This rule is repeated but is the same constraint.)

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event4 happens."" (read as: at some point, event2 or event4 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e. neither event2 nor event4 ever happens.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final conclusion
- From the initial event1, the next event must be event2, event4, or event5.
  - If the choice is event2 or event4, then C1 is true (so C2 is false).
  - If the choice is event5, then by the rules event1 must follow, and from event1 again the choice is {event2, event4, event5}. It is therefore possible to loop event1 → event5 → event1 → event5 ... forever, never taking event2 or event4. In that infinite trace C1 is false and C2 is true.
- Because the system’s rules permit both kinds of traces (some traces where event2 or event4 occur, and some where they never occur), neither C1 nor C2 is entailed by the context. C2 is satisfiable (there exists a valid trace making it true) but not necessarily true in all traces.

Answer to ""C2 is True or False?"":
- Undetermined by the given rules: C2 can be true in some executions and false in others. It is neither provably true nor provably false from the provided information.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the initial event1 you can immediately go to event2 or event4 (making C2 false), but you can also loop event1→event5→event1→... (making C2 true). C2 is satisfiable but not guaranteed, so it is not true in all executions."

- C2: “If C1 holds, then event3 happens” (i.e. from C1 we can conclude event3 occurs).

- From the rule event4 -> event3, whenever event4 happens it must be followed by event3. C1 includes event4, so under the rules event3 necessarily happens.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happens (it has already occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules (from the context)
- After event3: either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event1: either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event5: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- After event2: event1 must happen.
(Several rules were repeated; above is the consolidated set.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event5 happens."" Since event3 already happened initially, C1 further requires that event5 happens at some point.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalently, ""not (event3 and event5)"". Given event3 is true, C2 reduces to ""event5 does not happen.""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion about C2
- Is event5 forced to happen? No. From event3 you must go to either event1 or event5. You can choose event1 and then from event1 choose event3, and then repeat (3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ...), thereby avoiding event5 indefinitely. So there are valid executions where event5 never happens (making C2 true).
- Is event5 possible? Yes. From the initial event3 you could choose the transition to event5 immediately (3 → 5), so there are executions where event5 does happen (making C1 true).

Therefore:
- C1 is possible but not guaranteed.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is also possible but not guaranteed.

Final answer about C2:
- C2 is not determinately True or False given the context. It is satisfiable (there are executions where C2 holds) but not entailed (there are also executions where C2 is false). So its truth is undetermined/unknown from the given information.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event5 ⇒ event3 must happen.
- After event3 ⇒ event5 must happen. (So 3 and 5 force each other in alternation.)
- After event1 ⇒ either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2 ⇒ no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- After event4 ⇒ either event3 or event5 must happen.

Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"", the run starting from the initial state is: event2 and then nothing else.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (There is some future point at which event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" In plain terms: whenever event3 occurs, it follows that event3 eventually occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and truth values
- In the actual initial run (event2 then nothing), event3 never occurs, so C1 is false in that run.
- C2 is the implication: (event3 happens) ⇒ (event3 eventually happens). That implication is always true:
  - If event3 never happens, the implication is vacuously true.
  - If event3 does happen at some time, then by definition ""event3 eventually happens"" is true (it happened), so the implication holds.
- Therefore C2 is true (tautologically true under the intended reading of ""event3 happens"" and ""eventually"").

Conclusion: C2 is True (even though C1 is False in the provided initial scenario).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Additional explicit constraint: after event1, no other events can happen (so the sequence ends at event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)

- After event2 → either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event5 → event2 must happen. (This was stated twice; redundant.)
- After event4 → either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event1 → no other events can happen. (This overrides any further transitions from event1.)

- C2: “C1 does not hold.” So C2 is the negation of C1: C2 is true exactly when neither event5 nor event3 ever happens.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (we start in a state where event3 just occurred).

2) Transition rules (from the context)
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event3, event5}.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2}.
- After event4 → one of {event3, event5}.
- After event5 → event2.
(Notes: a few lines were repeated in the text but they say the same things.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens."" Interpreting this as a universal property of the transition relation: whenever event4 occurs, the next event must be event5 (i.e. 4 ⇒ 5).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: starting from the initial state, in the immediately following state, the property C1 should be true there (equivalently, C1 must hold universally from that next state).

4) Relation and evaluation
- Check C1 against the transition rules: After event4 the allowed next events are {event3, event5}. Since event3 is allowed after event4, event4 does not force event5; therefore C1 is not true in general.
- Provide a concrete counterexample trace (consistent with the rules):
  initial: event3
  next: event1  (allowed because 3 → {1,2})
  next: event4  (allowed because 1 → {2,3,4,5})
  next: event3  (allowed because 4 → {3,5})
  Here event4 was followed by event3, not event5, so C1 is violated.
- Because C1 is already false in the system (there exists a reachable situation where event4 is not followed by event5), C1 does not become true simply in the next state. So C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start event3 → event1 (allowed) → event4 (allowed) → event3 (allowed). So after event4 you can get event3, not event5, hence C1 is false in the successor state, so C2 (Next(C1)) is false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (after X, one of the following must happen)
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event3, event4}.
- After event3 → event2.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3, event5}.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event3}.
(Several rules were repeated in the context; the above is the reduced set.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens or event5 happens” (i.e., at some point in the run, event3 or event5 occurs).
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens” (i.e., either C1 is true, or event1 happens).

4) How these relate and the truth value of C2
- From the initial condition, event1 has already happened. So the disjunction “C1 or event1” is already satisfied by event1 regardless of whether C1 holds. Therefore C2 is true.
- For completeness about C1: C1 is not guaranteed by the rules — there are valid runs that never produce event3 or event5 (for example: 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 … repeats, avoiding 3 and 5). So C1 can be false in some executions, but that does not affect C2 because event1 already occurred.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Short answer: C2 is True when evaluated starting from the given initial state (initially event5). If you instead read C2 as a universal property that must hold at every possible state, it would be False. Below is the step-by-step breakdown.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event5 happened (call that time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event5 → event1 must happen next.
- After event1 → event2 must happen next.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen next.
- After event3 → event1 must happen next.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen next.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens or event5 happens.” (A proposition true in any state where the current event is event1 or event5.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” (At the current state, the proposition C1 is true of the immediately following state.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true?
- Starting from the initial state (event5 at time 0), the rule “after event5 → event1 must happen” forces event1 at time 1. At time 1 the current event is event1, so C1 (event1 or event5) is true there. Therefore, evaluated at the initial state, C2 is True.
- Caveat: if you instead interpret C2 as “for every possible state in the system, the next state always satisfies C1” (a universal/ global next-property), that is not guaranteed: for example, if the current event is event2, the next event could be event3 or event4 (both not event1 or event5), so C1 can be false in that next state. Under that universal reading C2 would be False.

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event5 happens and event1 happens.” Interpreted as: in the same allowed execution/history both event1 and event5 occur (order not explicitly required, but we have initial event1 so a natural reading is event1 occurs and at some point event5 occurs).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” Interpreted as the universal implication: in every allowed execution in which both event1 and event5 occur, event2 must also occur (somewhere in that execution).

4) How they relate — is C2 true?
- C2 is false. To disprove it it suffices to give one allowed execution (consistent with the rules) where both event1 and event5 occur but event2 never occurs.

Counterexample execution (all steps respect the rules):
- Start: event1 (given).
- From event1 choose event5 (allowed).
- From event5 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat the cycle 1 → 5 → 3 → 4 → 1 → ... forever.

This execution contains both event1 and event5 (so C1 holds) but never contains event2, and every transition used is permitted by the rules. Therefore the implication in C2 does not hold in general.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at time 0 the event is event1).

2) Transition rules (what can happen after each event)
- After event1: next must be event2 or event4.
- After event2: no further events (terminal).
- After event3: no further events (terminal).
- After event4: next must be event2, event3, or event5.
- After event5: next must be event1 or event4.

(Notes: some rules were duplicated in the text, but the above is the set of distinct rules.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event5 does not happen.” Interpreting this as a statement about a single state: that in that state event5 is not the occurring event.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: in the state immediately after the initial state, event5 does not occur.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the initial event1, the next state must be either event2 or event4 (by the rule after event1).
- In either case (event2 or event4) the next state is not event5. Therefore C1 (“event5 does not happen”) is true in the next state.
- Hence C2 is True.

One caveat: if C1 were intended as a global claim (“event5 never happens anywhere in the whole run”), that global C1 is not entailed (event5 can occur later via event4 → event5). But under the standard reading used above (C1 about a single state and C2 about the next state), C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C2 is True (C1 does not hold).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event4 happens first.

2) Transition rules (what may/must follow each event)
- After event2 → event1 must happen next.
- After event1 → next ∈ {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event4 → next ∈ {event1, event2}.
- After event5 → next ∈ {event2, event4}.
- After event3 → next ∈ {event1, event2, event4}.

Note: There is no rule that produces event3 from any other event, so event3 is unreachable from the given initial event4.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event5 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every valid infinite sequence of events (starting from the initial event4 and following the rules), event5 occurs at some time (or equivalently, event5 occurs in all possible runs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" The negation: there exists at least one valid run (starting from event4, following the rules) in which event5 never occurs.

4) Relation and evaluation
- To show C1 is false it suffices to exhibit one valid infinite sequence that never contains event5.
- From the rules and initial event4 we can construct the infinite loop:
  event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → ...
  Justification for each step:
  - From event4 we may choose event2 (allowed).
  - After event2 we must go to event1 (forced).
  - From event1 we may choose event4 (allowed).
  - Repeat.
- This cycle follows all rules and never includes event5. Therefore there exists a valid run with no event5, so C1 is false and C2 (the negation) is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Counterexample run: event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → ...  
This follows the rules (event4→event2 allowed, event2→event1 required, event1→event4 allowed) and never contains event5, so ""Event5 always happens"" is false; therefore C2 is True."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1: next must be one of {event2, event3, event5}.
- After event2: next must be event4.
- After event3: no further events (event3 is terminal).
- After event4: no further events (event4 is terminal).
- After event5: next must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" (Interpretation used below: in any run, whenever event3 occurs, event2 also occurs at some point in that run.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (Meaning: at some point in the execution C1 becomes true — here C1 can be evaluated as a property of the run; saying it ""eventually holds"" means it holds now or at some future point.)

4) Relation and evaluation
- Starting from the initial condition, the only possible execution (given the rules) is: event2 → event4 → stop. Reason: initial event2 forces event4, and event4 is terminal.
- Therefore event3 never occurs in any possible run.
- Because event3 never occurs, the implication ""if event3 happens then event2 happens"" is vacuously true in every run. So C1 is true (it holds immediately).
- Since C1 is already true from the start, the statement ""C1 eventually holds"" is also true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event5, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event1 happens."" (a conjunction: both events occur).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" (a conditional: C1 implies event4).

4) How the conditions relate / final reasoning
- By logical form, C1 explicitly asserts that event4 happens. So whenever C1 is true, event4 is true. Therefore the implication ""C1 → event4"" is logically valid (true).
- Additional note about the transition system: starting from the initial event3, there is no rule that leads to event1, so C1 is actually not realizable in any run starting from the initial condition. That only makes the implication even easier to satisfy (an implication with an impossible antecedent is still true). But this is unnecessary to conclude C2: even ignoring realizability, C1 syntactically contains event4, so C1 implies event4.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 asserts ""event4 and event1"", so whenever C1 holds event4 holds; hence the implication C1 → event4 is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens first.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must/can follow each event)
- After event1: one of {event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event2: one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3: one of {event2, event5} must happen.
- After event4: event1 must happen.
- After event5: no further events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “event4 happens or event3 happens” (i.e., at least one of event3 or event4 occurs sometime).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — equivalently, neither event3 nor event4 ever happens.

Step 4 — how they relate (analysis + examples)
- From the rules, multiple timelines are possible. Two representative timelines show C1 can be true or false:

  Example where C1 is true:
  - 1 → 4 (allowed after 1) — here event4 happens, so C1 holds (and C2 is false).

  Examples where C1 is false (so C2 holds):
  - 1 → 5 (allowed after 1) — event5 is terminal, and neither event3 nor event4 occurs, so C1 is false and C2 is true.
  - Or loop: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → … (always choose event1 after event2). This avoids event3 and event4 forever, so C2 holds.

Conclusion / direct answer
- C2 is not universally true (it does not follow from the rules in all possible executions), nor is it universally false. It is satisfiable (there are valid executions where C2 is true) and falsifiable (there are valid executions where C2 is false). So the correct characterization: C2 can be true in some runs and false in others — it is not guaranteed.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules (what must hold in the state immediately after a given event)
- After event4: next must be one of {event2, event3, event5}.
- After event2: next must be event5.
- After event3: next must be one of {event1, event4}.
- After event5: next must be one of {event1, event2, event3}. (This is repeated but is the same rule.)
- After event1: next must be one of {event3, event4, event5}. (Also repeated.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state” (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — the negation of C1.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Because the initial event is event2 and the rule “after event2, event5 must happen” applies, the next state must be event5. Therefore event3 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- Since C2 is the negation of C1, C2 is true.

Note on assumptions: This conclusion assumes the standard interpretation of “after X” as the event (or exactly one event) that must occur in the immediately following state. If you allowed multiple simultaneous events in the next state, the answer could differ (but the rules as given make event5 mandatory after event2).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the initial event is event2 and the rule ""after event2, event5 must happen"" forces the next state to be event5, so event3 does not occur next (C1 is false). Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is true."

- After event4: either event1 or event5 (4 → 1 or 4 → 5)
- After event5: either event1, event2, or event3 (5 → 1 or 5 → 2 or 5 → 3)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event4 eventually happens.” Meaning: at some point in the future (from whatever point we consider), event4 occurs.
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” Meaning: whenever event1 occurs, from that point forward event4 will eventually occur.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C2
- The rule “After event1: event4 must happen” directly implies that whenever event1 occurs, the very next event is event4. Therefore from any occurrence of event1, event4 occurs (hence “event4 eventually happens” after event1).
- So C2 is true: whenever event1 happens, C1 (that event4 eventually happens) holds.

(As a note: C1 is also true from the given initial condition, because we start at event1 and event4 must occur immediately afterward.)

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event4 happens first.

2) Transition rules (from each event, which next events are allowed)
- After event3 → event2 (must).
- After event2 → either event4 or event5.
- After event4 → either event1 or event5.
- After event5 → either event1 or event3.
- After event1 → either event2, event3, or event5.
(Notes: two rules in the prompt are repeated; they are the same as above.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Interpreting this as: in every possible run (starting from the initial event4 and following the allowed transitions), event3 will eventually occur. (Inevitability of event3.)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” I.e., there exists at least one valid run from the initial state in which event3 never occurs.

4) Relation and conclusion
- We just need one valid run that avoids event3 to show C1 is false and hence C2 true.
- Starting from event4, consider the choices that avoid event3:
  4 → 1 (choose event1 from event4)
  1 → 2 (choose event2 from event1)
  2 → 4 (choose event4 from event2)
  Then repeat: 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → …
- This yields an infinite cycle (4,1,2,4,1,2,...) that never includes event3 and respects all transition rules.
- Therefore event3 is not inevitable: C1 is false, and C2 (the negation) is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (exactly as given)
- After event5: next is one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event1: next is one of {event3, event4}.
- After event2: next is one of {event1, event5}.
- After event4: next is one of {event1, event2, event5}. (This rule was stated twice; it’s the same rule.)
- After event3: next is one of {event2, event4}.

(So the transition relation is fixed and the same at every state.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” Interpreting this in the usual temporal/transition sense: whenever event1 occurs, the next event must be event2.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: after one transition from the current state, the property C1 should be true in that next state (i.e., in that next state, it must be the case that whenever event1 happens then event2 happens).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the transition rules: after event1 the next event must be event3 or event4. There is no transition from event1 to event2. Therefore the claim “if event1 happens then event2 happens” (C1) is false under these rules — event2 is not required after event1, and in fact is ruled out by the given rule.
- Because the transition rules are global and do not change from state to state, C1 is false in every state (not just the current one). Hence C1 does not hold in the next state.
- Concrete counterexample: if event1 occurs, the rules allow next = event3. That violates C1 (which required next = event2).

I'll answer each question step by step and then evaluate C2.

1) What events are involved and the initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened initially.

(Interpretation note: I treat statements like ""EventX does not happen"" as globally ""EventX never happens in the run"".)

2) Transition rules between events (extracted and de-duplicated)
- After event4, event1 must happen. (4 -> 1)
- After event1, one of event2, event3, or event5 must happen. (1 -> {2,3,5})
- After event2, one of event1, event3, or event4 must happen. (2 -> {1,3,4})
- After event3, one of event1, event4, or event5 must happen. (3 -> {1,4,5})
- After event5, one of event1, event2, event3, or event4 must happen. (5 -> {1,2,3,4})

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — i.e., event1 never occurs in the execution.
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., whenever event3 occurs, event1 does not occur (equivalently: any run that contains event3 must be a run in which event1 never occurs).

4) How the conditions relate, and evaluation
- From the transition rules and the initial condition, after the initial event4 we must have event1 (because 4 -> 1). So event1 does happen in every allowed run. Therefore C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 asserts that if event3 occurs then event1 does not occur. But there are allowed runs where event3 does occur (for example: 4 -> 1 -> 3 is allowed since 4->1 and 1->3). In that run event3 occurs while event1 has already occurred, so the antecedent (event3 happens) is true and the consequent (event1 does not happen) is false. Thus C2 is false (counterexample: 4,1,3).

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: from the initial event4 we must have event1 (4 -> 1), and 1 can be followed by 3 (1 -> 3). The run 4,1,3 contains event3 while event1 occurred, so ""if event3 then event1 does not happen"" is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (we are in the state after event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event5: either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2: event4 must happen next.
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: either event2, event4, or event5 must happen next.
- After event1: event3 must happen next.
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the statement; I listed each unique rule once.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (i.e., in the current state, event1 is false.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” (i.e., in the state immediately following the current/initial state, event1 is false.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C2
- From the initial state (after event5), the next state must be either event2 or event4 (by the rule after event5).
- Neither event2 nor event4 is event1, so in every possible next state event1 does not occur.
- There is no rule that allows a transition to event1 from any of the reachable events; the only rule mentioning event1 is what must happen after event1, which is irrelevant because event1 is not reachable from the initial state.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the system starts after event4).

2) Transition rules
- After event4, either event2 or event5 must happen next.
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event5, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen next.
- After event3, no further events can happen (it is terminal).
- After event1, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal). (event3 was repeated in the statement; that is the same rule twice.)

So possible finite traces starting from the initial event4 include:
- event4 → event2 → event3 (then stop)
- event4 → event5 → event3 (then stop)
- event4 → event5 → event2 → event3 (then stop)
- event4 → event5 → event4 → ... (and then follow the same branching again)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens."" This is a logical implication of the form P → P where P is ""event5 happens."" P → P is a tautology: it is true in every state/formal structure (the implication is true whenever the antecedent and consequent are the same).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This says that at some point in the future (possibly now) the formula C1 is true.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because C1 is a logical tautology (P → P), it is true immediately in every state/point of every trace, whether or not event5 ever actually occurs. Therefore C1 holds now and hence holds ""eventually"" as well.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

Remark: If instead the intended meaning of C1 was a temporal one like ""If event5 happens now, then event5 happens at some future time"" (i.e., P_now → F P), that would be a different, nontrivial claim and would need separate analysis. But as written, C1 is tautologically true, so C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

C1 is the tautology ""P → P"" with P = ""event5 happens"", so C1 holds in every state (including the initial one). Hence C1 already holds now, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true."

- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the sequence starts at event2).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""After X, either ... must happen"" as ""from X the next event is one of ..."")
- From 2 → {3, 4, 5}
- From 3 → {4, 5}
- From 4 → {3, 5}
- From 5 → {1, 3, 4}
- From 1 → {2, 4, 5}
(Repeated lines in the problem statement are redundant and do not change the graph.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event1 happens"" — i.e., at some point along the future execution, either event4 or event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., neither event4 nor event1 ever occurs in the execution (the negation of C1).

4) How they relate / satisfiability
- C1 can be true in some executions. Example: 2 → 4 ... (already event4 happens), so C1 holds, hence C2 is false in that execution.
- C2 can be true in some executions. Example: choose transitions that avoid 1 and 4:
  2 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... 
  This infinite alternation between 3 and 5 is allowed by the rules (3 → 5, 5 → 3) and never visits 1 or 4, so C1 is false and C2 true in that execution.

Conclusion
- C2 is not logically forced (not always true) and not refuted (can be true in some runs). So the correct classification: C2 is satisfiable (there exists a run where it is true) but not valid (not true in all runs).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

C2 (""neither event4 nor event1 ever occurs"") is not guaranteed by the rules: e.g. the run 2 → 4 ... makes C1 true and therefore C2 false. (For completeness: C2 is satisfiable too — e.g. 2 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... avoids 1 and 4.)"

Short answer: C2 is True (event1 does not eventually happen).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, no other events can happen (event5 is terminal).
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen.

(Notes: the “after event5, no other events can happen” rule is repeated in the input; treat it as a single terminal rule.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens” — i.e., along the sequence of events that follows the rules starting from the initial state, at some point event1 occurs.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., event1 never occurs in the allowed sequence(s).

4) How the rules determine C1/C2
- Starting from event2, the rule “after event2, event5 must happen” forces the next event to be event5.
- Once event5 happens, the rule “after event5, no other events can happen” stops the sequence (no further events are allowed).
- Therefore the only possible sequence from the initial condition is: event2 → event5 and then termination. No opportunity exists for event1 to occur.

Conclusion: C1 is false (event1 does not eventually happen), so C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Starting from event2 the rules force event5 next, and event5 is terminal, so no further events (including event1) can occur; therefore C1 is false and C2 (its negation) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (consolidated)
- after event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4}
- after event1 → one of {event3, event5}
- after event3 → one of {event4, event5}
- after event4 → no further events (event4 is terminal)
- after event5 → one of {event1, event2}

(Several rules in the statement were repeated; these are the distinct transitions.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" Interpreting this as a temporal implication: whenever event2 occurs in a run, there must be some later occurrence of event3 in that same run.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means at some point (in the initial or a future state) the property C1 becomes true. In our simple single-run setting this reduces to asking whether C1 is true in the run(s) starting from the initial state (or becomes true later).

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- From the transitions, event4 is terminal: once event4 has happened no further events can occur.
- Because the initial state is event4 and it is terminal, there are no runs starting from the initial state in which event2 ever occurs.
- A conditional ""if P then Q"" is true vacuously whenever P never occurs. Therefore C1 is true in every run starting from the initial state (there are no occurrences of event2 to violate it).
- Since C1 is already true in the initial run, it certainly ""eventually holds"" — indeed it holds immediately.

Conclusion
- C2 is True (C1 holds, vacuously, in the run starting from the initial event4, so C1 already holds and thus eventually holds).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the initial state is event4, which is terminal so no further events (in particular event2) can ever occur. The implication ""if event2 happens then event3 happens"" is therefore vacuously true in the run starting from event4, so C1 holds immediately — hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true."

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreting ""after X, either A, B, … must happen"" as a nondeterministic choice among the listed next events)
- After event2 → either event1 or event5.
- After event1 → either event2, event4, or event5.

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted as a universal claim: from event3, event2 must occur in every possible continuation.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the negation of C1: there exists at least one possible continuation starting from event3 in which event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- From the transition rules, starting at event3 there are multiple possible next events (1,2,4,5). Some continuations produce event2 (e.g., event3 → event2 directly), but others can avoid it forever.
- Counterexample (shows C1 false): choose the following continuation:
  event3 → event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → …  
  From event1 you may choose event4; after event4 you must go to event1, and you can keep repeating event1↔event4 indefinitely without ever taking the event2 branch. Thus there exists a valid continuation from event3 that never includes event2.
- Therefore C1 is false (it does not hold universally). Consequently C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened.

2) Transition rules (non-deterministic ""must"" = at least one of the listed next events must occur)
- After event2: either event3 or event5.
- After event3: event4.
- After event5: either event1 or event3.
- After event4: either event2, event3, or event5.
- After event1: either event2 or event5.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreting this as a universal implication: whenever event5 occurs, event1 is guaranteed to occur (event1 must occur on all possible continuations).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e. C1 is false.

(If one instead interpreted C1 as an existence claim — “there exists a continuation from event5 that leads to event1” — that would be true because after event5 one possible next event is event1. But the usual reading of ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens"" is universal/guaranteed.)

4) Relation and evaluation
- To show C1 is false it suffices to exhibit a possible continuation where event5 happens but event1 never happens.
- From the rules we can follow this cycle: start at event5 (initial) → choose event3 (allowed after event5) → event4 (forced after event3) → choose event5 (allowed after event4) → repeat. Sequence: 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, ...
- This infinite loop contains event5 but never contains event1, so event1 is not guaranteed after event5.

Therefore C1 does not hold, and C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred.

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event1, event5 must happen (1 → 5).
- After event5, event4 must happen (5 → 4).
- After event4, event1 must happen (4 → 1).
- After event2, either event3, event4, or event5 must happen (2 → {3,4,5}).
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen (3 → {1,2,4}).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible valid execution (starting from the initial event2) event4 occurs at some point.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Interpreted as the statement that either (i) event1 necessarily occurs in every execution, or (ii) C1 is true (event4 occurs in every execution).

Step 4 — how they relate / evaluation
- There are executions in which event4 occurs (e.g. 2 → 4 → 1 → 5 → 4 → …), but we must check whether event4 occurs in every possible execution.
- Exhibit a valid execution that avoids both event4 and event1 forever: repeat the choices 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ….
  - After each 2 we choose 3 (allowed by 2 → {3,4,5}).
  - After each 3 we choose 2 (allowed by 3 → {1,2,4}).
  - This infinite run respects all rules but never reaches event4 or event1.
- Therefore:
  - C1 is false (because there exists a valid execution with no event4).
  - Since C1 is false, C2 reduces to ""event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 must occur in every execution). But the same counterexample run (the infinite 2↔3 loop) shows event1 need not occur.
  - Hence C2 is false.

Final answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: the infinite run 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → … is allowed (2 → 3 and 3 → 2 are both permitted), and it never reaches event1 or event4. So C1 is false and event1 is not guaranteed, hence C2 is false."

Answer: C2 is True (inevitably holds). Below are the step-by-step answers you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event5 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
(Condensed, duplicates removed)
- After event5 → event4.
- After event4 → either event1 or event2.
- After event1 → either event2 or event5.
- After event2 → event3.
- After event3 → either event1, event4, or event5.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (i.e., at some point in the future event1 occurs).
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" In other words, either event3 occurs at some future point, or event1 occurs at some future point (or both). So C2 is the disjunction (event3 eventually) OR (event1 eventually).

4) How do these conditions relate and does C2 hold?
- Start from the initial event5. The rules force: 5 → 4.
- From event4 one of two must happen: either 4 → event1 or 4 → event2.
  - Case A: 4 → event1. Then event1 has occurred, so C1 is true, hence C2 (which is C1 ∨ event3) is true.
  - Case B: 4 → event2. Then by the rule after event2, event3 must happen (2 → 3). So event3 occurs, making C2 true.
- There are no other choices from the start: every possible continuation after the forced 5→4 step leads either to event1 (making C1 true) or to event2 followed by event3 (making event3 true). Thus in every possible run from the initial state C2 becomes true.

Conclusion: C2 is True (it necessarily holds given the initial condition and the transition rules).

Short answer: C2 is False (not guaranteed).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start at event3).

2) Transition rules (read as nondeterministic choices for the next event)
- After event3: next is either event1 or event5.
- After event2: event1 must happen. (Given in the original text: ""After event2, event1 must happen."")
- After event1: next is one of event3, event4, or event5.
- After event4: next is either event3 or event5.
- After event5: next is one of event2, event3, or event4.
(Notes: the three repeated lines ""After event5, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen."" are the same rule repeated.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (i.e., along an execution from the initial state, event2 occurs at some future step.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e., either event2 will eventually happen, or event2 happens — the second disjunct is redundant because if event2 happens now/ever then C1 is true; but as a disjunction it is true iff event2 happens in the run at some point.)

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- From the rules, event2 can occur if we ever take an event5 transition that chooses event2. So there are executions where event2 does happen (e.g., 3 → 5 → 2 ...).
- However, the system also admits executions that forever avoid event2. For example:
  3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... 
  This is allowed because after 3 we may choose 1, and after 1 we may choose 3; repeating this cycle never visits event5 or event2.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed (it is not true on all possible executions).
- Since C2 is equivalent to ""event2 occurs at some point"" (same truth-condition as C1), C2 is also not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is False as a universal claim about the system (it can be false along some valid executions). If you mean ""is C2 possible in some run?"" then yes — C2 can be true in runs that do visit event2 — but as an invariant/guarantee it is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial state 3 there is a valid infinite execution 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... that never visits 5 (hence never visits 2), so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed. C2 is equivalent to that eventuality and therefore is not guaranteed either."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the start).

2) Transition rules (as given)

- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event5 must happen.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" (an implication: event1 ⇒ event4)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" That is: event1 ⇒ (event1 ⇒ event4).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the rule ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" whenever event1 occurs it prevents any other event from occurring afterwards. In particular, event4 cannot occur after event1.
- The initial condition says event1 does happen. So we have a concrete occurrence of event1 with no possibility of event4 following it. Therefore C1 (event1 ⇒ event4) is false in this scenario.
- C2 asserts that if event1 happens then C1 holds. But event1 does happen, and C1 is false, so C2 is false as well.

(If one allowed non-temporal readings where event4 could have occurred before event1 or simultaneously, the evaluation could differ; under the natural temporal reading given by ""initially"" and the ""after ..."" rules, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: given the rules, event1 occurs and prevents any subsequent events, so event4 cannot follow—C1 (event1 ⇒ event4) is false. Also in propositional logic p ⇒ (p ⇒ q) is equivalent to p ⇒ q, so C2 has the same truth value as C1 and is therefore false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event3: one of event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- After event1: event3 must happen.
- After event2: one of event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event4: event1 must happen.
- After event5: one of event2 or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (i.e., from the current state, the immediately following state has event1.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreting “always” in the usual branching/non-deterministic sense: for every reachable state, the next state must have event1 (equivalently, in every possible transition, event1 is the immediate successor).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial state (event2), the rules force the next state to be either event3 or event5 (because after event2 we must have event3 or event5).
- Therefore the next state is not forced to be event1 — it could be event3 or it could be event5.
- Counterexample: choose the allowed transition initial: event2 → event5. Then the “next state” does not have event1, so C1 is false in that execution, and hence C1 does not hold in all states.
- Because there is at least one allowed transition where C1 fails, C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" In other words, C2 = not C1 = ""Event2 does happen.""

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- C2 is simply the negation of C1.
- From the rules starting at event3 there are two relevant branches:

  1. If after event3 we choose event4, then by the rule after event4, event2 must happen. So in this run event2 occurs (C2 is true).

  2. If after event3 we choose event5, and then after event5 we repeatedly choose event1 (and after event1 we must return to event5), we can get an infinite loop 3 → 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ... that never produces event2. In this run event2 does not occur (C1 is true, so C2 is false).

Conclusion
- The available rules do not force a single truth value: there exist executions where C2 is true and executions where C2 is false. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (it is neither universally true nor universally false given the information).

Reason: From any event the rules force a path back to event3:

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (initially).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → event4 must happen.
- After event4 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event3 → event2 must happen.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” (i.e., event1 never occurs).
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens” — equivalently: event1 never occurs AND event2 does occur.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event4 and the rule “after event4 → event2”, event2 does necessarily occur (it is forced by the rules).
- Whether event1 ever occurs is not fixed by the rules: after event2 one of {event1, event3, event5} must occur, so event1 might occur, but it might not (event3 or event5 could be chosen instead). Similarly, future transitions from event3 or event5 could lead to event1 or avoid it. Therefore C1 (event1 never happens) is not guaranteed by the given rules; it is possible in some runs and false in others.
- C2 requires both C1 and event2. Event2 does necessarily happen, but C1 does not necessarily hold. So C2 is not guaranteed/entailed by the context. More precisely:
  - C2 is satisfiable (there are valid sequences where event2 happens and event1 never occurs).
  - C2 is not necessarily true (not entailed) given only the rules and the initial event4.

If you need a single-word answer: C2 is not provably True (undetermined); it is possible but not guaranteed (so you should treat it as not true as a logical consequence).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event1 occurred (the system starts in a state labeled event1).

2) Transition rules (from each event, the next event must be one of the listed options)
- After event1 → either event2 or event5.
- After event2 → either event1 or event3.
- After event5 → either event3 or event4.
- After event3 → either event1 or event5.
- After event4 → either event2 or event5.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this as the temporal property G(event1) — at every future step the current event is event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreting as X(C1) — in the immediate successor state, the property C1 (always event1 from that point on) is true.

4) How the conditions relate and why C2 is false
- C1 is false already: from the initial event1 the rules force the next event to be either event2 or event5, so the very next state is not event1, so event1 does not hold at every future state.
- For C2 (X C1) to be true, every possible immediate successor of the initial state would have to satisfy C1 (i.e., from that successor onward event1 would have to occur at every step). But:
  - If the next state is event2, a possible next step is event3 (from event2 → event3), so event1 would not occur at that time, so C1 fails starting from event2.
  - If the next state is event5, a possible next step is event3 or event4 (neither is event1), so C1 fails starting from event5.
- Therefore neither successor enforces ""event1 at every future step"", so X(C1) is false.

A concrete counterexample trace: event1 → event2 → event3 → event5 → ... shows event1 does not hold at every future step, and starting at the next state (event2) C1 is already false. Hence C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the system starts after event2).

2) Transition rules (read as nondeterministic “one of these must next occur”)
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must occur.
- After event1: either event3 or event4 must occur.
- After event3: event5 must occur.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must occur.
- After event5: either event1, event2, or event3 must occur.
(Repeated lines in the context are duplicates and do not change the set of rules.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event4 does not happen.” (a statement about a particular run/trace: no occurrence of event4.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreting “always” as a universal property: in every possible allowed execution (from the initial condition and given the rules), event4 never occurs. In other words, C2 asserts that event4 is impossible in all runs.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the rules there is a valid sequence of events where event4 does happen:
  - Start: event2 (given).
  - After event2, pick event1 (allowed).
  - After event1, pick event4 (allowed).
  => event4 occurs in this run, so C1 is false for that run.
- Because there exists at least one allowed execution where event4 occurs, the universal claim C2 (“event4 never occurs in all executions”) is false.

One can also note that other executions may avoid event4 (e.g., event2 → event3 → event5 → ...), so C1 can be true in some runs, but C2 (that C1 always holds) fails.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial state: event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event2: next is one of {event1, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event1: next is one of {event4, event5}.
- After event3: next is one of {event1, event4}.
- After event4: next is one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- After event5: next is one of {event1, event2}.

(Notes: some lines were repeated, but they restate the same transitions for event4 and event5.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual temporal sense: in every state (or in every step of every possible future), event2 holds — i.e., event2 occurs at every time point (or equivalently: on every path, at every step the event is event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, immediately after the initial state, C1 is true (from that next state onward, event2 always happens).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- C1 is false: the initial state is event3, so event2 does not hold there; moreover there are valid paths that never hit event2. For example:
  event3 -> event1 -> event4 -> event1 -> event4 -> ... 
  This cycle (event1 <-> event4 choices) is allowed by the transitions and avoids event2 forever. So event2 is not ""always"" true.
- C2 is false: from the initial event3, the next state can be event1 (since after event3 the next is {event1, event4}). In that next state (event1), C1 is still false because from event1 the next is {event4, event5} and we can continue on paths that avoid event2 (same cycle above). Since there exists a next state (event1) in which C1 does not hold, the statement ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false (initially event3 and there are paths avoiding event2, e.g. 3 → 1 → 4 → 1 → ...). Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false, since the next state can be event1 where C1 still does not hold."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (this is the starting point).

2) Transition rules (restated)
- After event1: next must be one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2: next must be one of {event3, event4}.
- After event3: next must be one of {event2, event4}.
- After event4: next must be one of {event2, event5}.
- After event5: next must be event2.
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the text; I combined duplicates.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" Interpreting in the usual temporal/transition sense this means: whenever event2 occurs on a run, event5 will occur (at some future time or as a follow-up). C1 is a universal implication about runs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" i.e. C1 is true in all possible runs/choices allowed by the transition rules.

4) How the rules relate and evaluation
- From event2 the system may go to event3 or event4. From event3 it may go back to event2 or to event4. From event4 it may go to event2 or event5.
- There is a valid infinite run that shows C1 can fail: start at the given initial event4, choose event2 (allowed by event4 → event2). From event2 choose event3 (allowed), then from event3 choose event2, and repeat: event4, event2, event3, event2, event3, ... . This run contains event2 many times but never reaches event5. Thus it is possible for event2 to occur without event5 ever happening.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed on all runs, so C2 (that C1 always holds) is False.

If you intended a different interpretation of ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens"" (for example, ""event5 must immediately follow event2"" rather than ""eventually""), the same counterexample still applies because the rules do not force event5 directly after event2.

Step 1 — events and initial condition

- Initial condition: event2 happened (so every evolution starts with event2).

- After event5 → either event1 or event2.
- After event1 → either event4 or event5.
- After event2 → event3 (must).
- After event3 → either event2 or event5.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting this as: in every possible evolution (every possible sequence of events starting from the initial state), event3 occurs at least once.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" This is the logical OR: C2 is true if either C1 is true, or event1 occurs in the evolution (or both).

Step 4 — how they relate / evaluation
- From the initial condition, event2 has occurred and the rule ""after event2 → event3"" is a must. Therefore every evolution must include event3 (immediately after the initial event2). So C1 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we start at a state labeled event3).

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event1: next must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2: next must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- After event3: next must be one of {event2, event5}.
- After event4: next must be one of {event1, event5}.
- After event5: next must be event1.
(Notes: the problem repeats some rules; they are the same as listed above.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” Interpreted as the temporal statement F(event2): at some future point along the timeline, event2 occurs.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” That is F(C1) = F(F(event2)). In linear temporal logic F(F(p)) is equivalent to F(p), so syntactically C2 has the same meaning as C1 (event2 happens at some future time).

Important semantic clarification:
- There are two common ways to read “eventually” in a nondeterministic system:
  1. Existential reading (there exists a possible future/path where event2 occurs). This is “possibly event2” (♦event2).
  2. Universal/inevitability reading (on all possible futures/paths event2 will eventually occur). This is “inevitably event2” (□♦event2).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Syntactically C2 ≡ C1 (F(F(event2)) = F(event2)), so they are the same statement in linear-time temporal logic.

Which is true depends on the semantic reading:
- Under the existential/possibility reading: True. From the initial event3 you may choose event2 immediately (event3 → event2 …), so there exists a future path where event2 occurs. Therefore C1 is true and so is C2.
- Under the universal/inevitability reading: False. There is a valid infinite path that never produces event2: choose event3 → event5 → event1 → event3 → event5 → event1 → … repeatedly (after event5 must be event1, from event1 choose event3, from event3 choose event5, etc.). This infinite cycle avoids event2 forever, so event2 does not inevitably happen on all futures. Hence C1 (and thus C2) is false under the universal reading.

Short conclusion
- If “eventually” is interpreted existentially (there exists a future), C2 is True.
- If “eventually” is interpreted universally/inevitably (for all futures), C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: from the initial event3 there is a valid infinite path event3 → event5 → event1 → event3 → … that never visits event2, so event2 is not inevitable; since C2 ≡ C1, C2 is false under the universal/inevitability reading. (If ""eventually"" were interpreted existentially, C2 would be true.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (start state = after event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must / may happen next)
- After event5, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event5 must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event1, event5 must happen.
- After event4, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” This is ambiguous unless we fix a semantics:
  - Universal (inevitability) reading: C1 means in every possible execution starting from the initial condition, event2 will occur at some point.
  - Existential (possibility) reading: C1 means there exists at least one execution (one possible run) in which event2 occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” If C1 is taken to mean “event2 eventually happens,” then C2 is logically redundant — it amounts to “event2 eventually happens AND event2 happens,” i.e. it is true exactly when event2 happens (under the same temporal reading as C1).

Step 4 — how the rules relate and evaluation
- From the initial event5 we must go to event3. From event3 we have two possible next steps: event2 or event5.
  - If at that choice we pick event2, then event2 has happened (so C1 and C2 are satisfied on that run).
  - If instead the choice picks event5, we return to the same situation (event5 → event3 → choice) and this can repeat forever.
- Therefore there exist executions where event2 occurs (e.g. 5 → 3 → 2), and there also exist executions that avoid event2 forever (e.g. 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ...).

Final answer about C2
- Under the existential/possibility reading: C2 is True (there is a run where C1 holds and event2 happens).
- Under the universal/inevitability reading (the usual meaning if you ask “does the system guarantee event2 eventually?”): C2 is False — event2 is not guaranteed because the nondeterministic choices could forever loop 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 … and never choose 2.

If you intended one specific semantics (guarantee vs possibility), tell me which and I’ll state the single definitive answer.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: from the start (after event5) the system can loop 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → … by always choosing the transition back to event5, so event2 is not guaranteed to eventually occur. Hence C1 (inevitability) fails and therefore C2 is false."

- From the initial event3, the rule ""after event3: event2 or event5"" means event5 is possible but not forced (event2 could occur instead).
- We can follow a sequence that avoids event5 indefinitely, for example:
  event3 → event2 → event4 → event1 → event2 → event4 → event1 → ... 
  (choices after event2 and event1 can always avoid choosing event5).
- Because there is at least one valid execution that never produces event5, event5 is not guaranteed from the initial condition.

- C1: True.
- C2: Not guaranteed (False if you require it to be entailed/always true).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (this is the current/previous state).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2: either event3 or event5 must happen next.
- After event4: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event5: event3 must happen next.
- After event3: no further events can happen.

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (i.e., immediately after the initial event1)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state — equivalently, event4 must happen next)

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- C2 is simply the negation of C1.
- From the rules, after event1 the next state must be either event2 or event4. That means event2 is possible but not guaranteed.
- Therefore C1 is not entailed by the premises (it may or may not hold). Likewise C2 is not entailed either, because event2 could indeed occur.

Final answer
- C2 is not determinable from the given information (neither provably True nor provably False). In other words, C2 may be true in some allowed executions (if event4 is chosen next), but it is not necessarily true given the premises.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (the run starts at state 3).

Step 2 — transition rules (from each event, which next events are allowed)
- From event1 → {event2, event3, event5}.
- From event2 → {event3, event4}.
- From event3 → {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- From event4 → {event1, event2, event5}.
- From event5 → {event2, event4}.

(Notes: the original text repeated some rules; the above is the cleaned set.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 eventually happens.” Interpreted as: along a particular run starting from the initial state, at some future step event5 occurs.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreted as the (stronger) property that from every reachable state (i.e. on every possible continuation/run) event5 will eventually occur — equivalently, on every possible path from the initial state you will eventually see event5.

Step 4 — how they relate and the answer about C2
- C1 is satisfiable from the initial state (there exist runs where event5 occurs, e.g. 3 → 5).
- But C2 requires that every possible run must eventually reach event5. This is false: there are infinite runs that avoid event5 forever.

Counterexample (infinite run avoiding event5):
- Start at 3, choose 1: 3 → 1
- From 1 choose 2: 1 → 2
- From 2 choose 3: 2 → 3
- Repeat: 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ...
This cycle uses only {1,2,3} and never takes any transition to event5, so event5 never occurs on that run.

Conclusion: C2 is False. (C1 can be true on some runs, but it is not guaranteed on all runs.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happens (at the start).

2) Transition rules (obligations after an event)
- After event4: one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event2: event1 must happen.
- After event3: one of {event1, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event5: event4 must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.

(Notes: the rules are nondeterministic choices constrained to the listed alternatives.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event5 happens."" (i.e. in the trace both event1 and event5 occur at some points.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. in every possible execution consistent with the rules, both event1 and event5 occur.)

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- event5 does happen initially in every execution, so event5 is guaranteed.
- event1 is not guaranteed: from the initial event5 the forced next event is event4 (because after 5 must come 4). From event4 the system may choose event5 again (since after 4 one allowed option is event5). That yields the infinite loop 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → ... which satisfies all rules but never contains event1. Thus there exists at least one valid execution where event1 never happens.
- Therefore C1 is not true in all executions (it is true in some executions — e.g. 5 → 4 → 2 → 1 — but not all). Consequently, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: starting from the initial event5 the system can loop 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 ... forever (each step satisfies the rules), so event1 need not occur in all executions; thus C1 is not always true and C2 is False."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (so the execution starts with event3).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event5 → either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1 → either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event3 → no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2 → either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event4 → event1 must happen.

(“After event3, no other events can happen” appears twice but is the same rule.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens or event4 happens.” Interpreted as “at some point in the execution, event2 or event4 occurs.”
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreted naturally as “in every possible execution starting from the initial condition, C1 is true” (i.e., every allowed run contains event2 or event4).

4) How the rules relate and evaluation
- The initial event3 is terminal because the rule “after event3 no other events can happen” means the execution stops immediately after the initial event3.
- Therefore the only event that occurs in any execution starting from the given initial condition is event3; neither event2 nor event4 ever occurs.
- Hence C1 is false in the actual (and only) execution, and so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happens in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen immediately after each event)
- After event2: next ∈ {event3, event4, event5}.
- After event3: next ∈ {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event4: next = event1 (must happen).
- After event5: next ∈ {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1: next ∈ {event4, event5}.
(Repeated statements in the context do not change these rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 happens in the next state” — i.e., from the current state, the immediate successor state is event5.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — i.e., at every state in the execution, the immediate next state is event5 (C1 true at every time).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial state we have event4. By the rule “after event4, event1 must happen,” the next state is event1. Therefore C1 is false in the initial state (the next state is event1, not event5).
- C2 requires C1 to hold at every state; since C1 already fails at the initial state, C2 is false.

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: at the current state (time 0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules (what must happen immediately after each event)
- After event5 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event3 or event4.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2.
- After event4 → either event1 or event3.
- After event1 → either event2, event3, or event4.
(Several rules were repeated in the text; I listed each unique rule once.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state"" — i.e., at time 1, event5 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., at time 0 we claim that at time 1 the proposition C1 is true. Since C1 itself asserts event5 at the next state, C2 therefore requires event5 to occur at time 2. (This is the usual nested-next interpretation: C2 = X(C1) = X(X(event5)).)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial event2 at time 0, the allowed events at time 1 are event3 or event4 (by the rule for after event2). So event5 cannot occur at time 1. Therefore C1 is false at time 0.
- For C2 to be true at time 0 we would need event5 at time 2. Consider both possible time-1 cases:
  - If time 1 = event3 → time 2 must be event1 or event2 (no event5).
  - If time 1 = event4 → time 2 must be event1 or event3 (no event5).
  In neither case can event5 occur at time 2. There is no rule that allows event5 to follow event1, event2, event3, or event4, so event5 can never be reached from the given initial event2.
- Hence C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the initial event2 at time 0, time‑1 must be event3 or event4 (since after event2 → event3 or event4), so event5 cannot occur at time‑1 (C1 is false). From either event3 or event4 at time‑1, the allowed time‑2 events are {event1,event2} or {event1,event3}, respectively—none is event5—so event5 cannot occur at time‑2 either. Therefore C2 (that event5 holds at time‑2) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (so we start in state ""3"").

Step 2 — transition rules (from each event, which next events are possible)
- From event3 → {event1, event2, event5}.
- From event1 → {event3}.
- From event2 → {event1, event3}.
- From event5 → {event2, event4}.
- From event4 → {event1, event5}.

(Notes: some rules were repeated in the problem statement but they are the same transitions.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This phrase is ambiguous without a path-quantifier:
  - Existential reading (∃): there exists some possible execution (path) starting from the initial state along which event2 occurs at some future step.
  - Universal reading (∀): along every possible execution starting from the initial state, event2 occurs at some future step (i.e., event2 is inevitable).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C1.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate (analysis)
- There exists a path where event2 occurs immediately: 3 → 2. So under the existential reading, C1 is true.
- There also exists a path that never hits event2: for example 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (the cycle 3↔1). This path never visits event2. So under the universal reading, C1 is false.

Conclusion — is C2 true or false?
- If C1 is meant existentially (""there exists a run where event2 eventually happens""), then C1 is true, so C2 (its negation) is false.
- If C1 is meant universally (""in every run event2 eventually happens""), then C1 is false (counterexample 3→1→3→...), so C2 is true.

Which applies depends on the intended semantics of ""eventually"" in your setting.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: there is a run 3 → 2, so ""event2 eventually happens"" can be satisfied; thus C1 can be true and C2 (its negation) is false. (If you instead interpret ""eventually"" as ""in every run,"" then the answer would be True, because 3→1→3→... avoids event2.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (succession options)
From the text the allowed immediate successors are:
- after event5 → one of {event1, event2, event3}
- after event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}
- after event2 → one of {event3, event5}
- after event3 → one of {event4, event5}
- after event4 → event5

(Several sentences in the context repeat these same rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens AND event2 happens.""

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion about C2
- We know event2 happened initially, so C1 is true.
- Is event1 guaranteed to happen? No. From the initial event2 the system must move to either event3 or event5. From either choice, event5 is inevitable eventually (2 → 3 or 5; 3 → 4 or 5; 4 → 5). After event5 one of {event1, event2, event3} happens, but that is a nondeterministic choice — event1 is only one possible outcome, not forced.
- There exist executions where event1 never occurs (for example: start at event2 → choose event5 → choose event2 → repeat that loop), so event1 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C1 is true, but C2 (which requires event1 to hold as well) is not guaranteed/ not provable from the rules. In other words, C2 does not necessarily hold (it can be false in some executions), so you cannot conclude C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred (we start from a state immediately after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (what can happen after each event)
- After event1, either event2, event4, or event5 must happen next.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event4, either event3 or event5 must happen next.
- After event5, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event3, either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen next.

(You had the rule “After event5, either event1, or event2 must happen” listed twice; it’s the same rule.)

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event5 always happens.” Interpreting “always” as: in every possible future execution (every possible trace) from the initial condition, event5 occurs at some point.
- C2: “C1 holds and event5 happens.” This is the conjunction: (C1 is true) AND (event5 happens). Since C1 already asserts event5 always happens, C2 essentially asserts that event5 always happens (and asserts that an occurrence of event5 does happen).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth values
- Because after event1 one allowed next event is event2, and after event2 nothing else can happen, there is a valid trace: event1 → event2 and stop. In that trace event5 never occurs.
- That single valid trace is a counterexample to C1 (which required event5 to occur in every possible trace). Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to be true, C2 is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: There is a valid trace event1 → event2 (event2 is terminal), so event5 does not occur in that trace. Hence ""event5 always happens"" (C1) is false, and therefore C2 (C1 and event5 happens) is also false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3: next must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- After event1: next must be event3 or event5.
- After event2: next must be event3.
- After event4: next must be event3.
- After event5: next must be event4.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" — i.e., there is no occurrence of event3 in the execution.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event4 happens"" — i.e., event3 never occurs AND event4 occurs at least once.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- From the initial event5 and the rule “after event5 → event4”, the next event must be event4.
- From that event4 and the rule “after event4 → event3”, the next event must be event3.
- Therefore event3 does occur (in fact it must occur immediately after the initial 5→4), so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to be true (no event3) and event4 to happen. Although event4 does happen, C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Starting from event5 → event4 → event3, event3 must occur, so C1 is false; since C2 requires C1 true (and event4), C2 is false."

- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (i.e., event5 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event1 → one of {event2, event4} must happen.
- After event3 → one of {event4, event5} must happen.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event3} must happen.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the given text; the above captures each unique rule.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event5 happens or event4 happens."" This is the logical disjunction event5 ∨ event4 — true if at least one of event5 or event4 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation ¬(event5 ∨ event4), i.e., neither event5 nor event4 happens.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- The initial condition states event5 already happened. That makes the disjunction event5 ∨ event4 true immediately, so C1 is true.
- Therefore C2, being the negation of C1, is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Answer: C2 is False. Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1: no other events can happen (1 is terminal).
- After event2: event5 must happen (2 → 5).
- After event5: event4 must happen (5 → 4).
- After event4: either event2 or event5 must happen (4 → {2, 5}).
- After event3: no other events can happen (3 is terminal).

3) What the hypotheses mean
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event3 happens."" Interpreted as a universal implication: whenever 5 occurs, 3 must (later) occur.
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true exactly if (a) event3 does happen in the system and (b) the implication in C1 is true.

4) How these relate and the conclusion
- From the rules, starting at the initial event4 we must take either 4→2 or 4→5.
  - If 4→2, then 2→5 and then 5→4, so we get the cycle 4→2→5→4→...
  - If 4→5, then 5→4 and we get the cycle 4→5→4→...
- The reachable events from the initial 4 are therefore only {4,2,5} in cycles. There is no rule that leads to event3 (or event1) from any of these, so event3 never happens in any execution starting from the given initial condition.
- C1 is false because there are executions in which event5 happens (e.g., 4→5→4→...) but event3 does not. So the implication ""if 5 then 3"" does not hold universally.
- Since event3 does not happen, the conjunction in C2 (""event3 happens AND C1 holds"") is false (both because event3 is false and because C1 is false).

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From initial event4 only events 4,2,5 can occur (cycles 4→2→5→4 or 4→5→4), so event3 never happens. C1 (""if 5 then 3"") is false because 5 can occur without 3. Hence the conjunction C2 (event3 happens AND C1) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event5: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen. (This rule appears twice in the context but is the same rule.)
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen. (Also appears twice.)
- After event3: no other events can happen (terminal). (Also repeated.)

- C2: ""C1 holds and event4 happens."" (i.e., ¬event5 ∧ event4)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth values
- C2 logically requires C1 to be true and event4 to occur.
- But the context explicitly states event5 happened initially, so C1 (""event5 does not happen"") is false.
- Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (C1 and event4) is false regardless of whether event4 occurs.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (this is the current state).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event2 → next must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1 → next must be one of {event2, event3}.
- After event3 → next must be event2.
- After event4 → next must be event3.
- After event5 → next must be event3.

(“After event3 → event2” was stated twice; same rule.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: “Event5 happens in the next state.” Interpreting “next state” as the state immediately following the initial state (where event3 happened).
- C2: “Event5 happens and C1 holds.” This is logically Event5 ∧ C1. Since C1 is the proposition “Event5 happens in the next state,” C2 is effectively the same condition repeated (Event5 ∧ Event5), so C2 is true exactly when C1 is true.

Step 4 — apply the rules to decide C1 and C2
- From the initial event3, the rule “after event3 → event2” forces the immediate next state to be event2.
- Therefore the next state is event2, not event5. So C1 is false.
- Since C2 is true only if C1 is true (and requires event5), C2 is also false.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (the sequence starts with event3).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen immediately after each event)
- After event3 → next event ∈ {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → next event ∈ {event1, event3, event5}.
- After event4 → next event ∈ {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event5 → next event ∈ {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event1 → next event = event4.

(These are nondeterministic choices; at each step one of the allowed next events is chosen.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event5 happens."" Interpreting naturally, C1 means in the execution trace both event3 and event5 occur at some points (event3 already occurs initially; C1 additionally requires that event5 occurs at some time).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That means C1 must be true in every possible execution (i.e., in every allowed run/trace of the system). In other words, in every possible future from the initial state both event3 and event5 must occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Event3 already occurred initially, so the only nontrivial part of C1 is whether event5 is guaranteed to occur in every possible run.
- The system is nondeterministic, so we only have guarantees if every allowed transition sequence necessarily reaches event5. But that is not the case.

Counterexample run that avoids event5 forever:
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose event4 (allowed from event3).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 you must go to event4.
- Repeat event4 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ... forever.

This infinite loop (3, 4, 1, 4, 1, …) is allowed by the transition rules and never visits event5. In that run C1 is false (because event5 never occurs), so C1 does not hold in every execution.

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False. (C1 may hold in some runs — e.g. 3 → 5 — but not in all runs.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start at event3, choose event4, then event1, then event4, then event1, ... This infinite run (3,4,1,4,1,...) is allowed by the rules and never visits event5. So although C1 can be true in some runs, it is not true in every run; therefore C2 is False."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happens (at the start).

2) Transition rules (next-event choices)
- After event1 → event2 must happen next.
- After event2 → the next event is one of {event1, event3, event5}.
- After event3 → the next event is one of {event2, event5}.
- After event4 → the next event is one of {event3, event5}.
- After event5 → no further events (event5 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens and event4 happens.” Interpreted as both events occur at some times (event3 occurs and event4 occurs at some point in the run).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” That means at some future time the conjunction in C1 becomes true (i.e., there is a time by which both event3 and event4 have occurred).

4) How they relate; reachability analysis and conclusion
- Start: event3 has already occurred.
- From event3 the only possible next events are event2 or event5.
  - If event5 occurs, the run terminates (no further events), so event4 can never occur after that.
  - If event2 occurs, the next event can be event1, event3, or event5. None of these transition choices leads to event4.
- No rule gives a successor that is event4 except being already at event4; and there is no rule from any reachable event that can produce event4. Thus event4 is unreachable from the initial event3.
- Therefore C1 (both event3 and event4 happen) can never become true, because event4 can never occur. So C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happens in the initial state (call it state 0).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""After X, Y must happen"" as: in the next state after a state where X held, Y must hold):
- After event4: next state must have one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event1: next state must have event2.
- After event2: next state must have either event1 or event5. (This rule was repeated; same meaning.)
- After event3: next state must have event1.
- After event5: next state must have one of {event1, event3, event4}. (This was repeated; same meaning.)

(I assume these are requirements for the immediate next state. I also assume the rules specify at least which event(s) must occur next; they do not explicitly permit multiple simultaneous events unless a rule requires it.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event5 happens and event4 happens."" Interpreted as: in a given state both event5 and event4 are true simultaneously.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted as: in the immediate next state (from the current/initial state) both event5 and event4 are true.

4) How do these relate and evaluation:
- Start at state 0: event3 holds.
- By ""After event3, event1 must happen"" → state 1 must have event1.
- By ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → state 2 must have event2.
- From event2, next state must be either event1 or event5 → state 3 is either event1 or event5. If we choose the branch giving event5, then:
- After event5, next state must be one of {event1, event3, event4} → state 4 could be event4 (but that is a later state).

C2 asks whether in the immediate next state (state 1) both event5 and event4 hold. State 1 must have event1 (by the rule after event3). Therefore state 1 does not have event5 and event4 together. Even exploring later states, event5 and event4 can occur at different times (e.g., event5 at state 3 and event4 at state 4), but C1 requires them simultaneously in one state, and C2 requires that simultaneous pair in the next state. The rules do not force or allow both event5 and event4 to hold together in the very next state after the initial event3.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: from the initial state event3 holds, so the immediate next state must have event1. C1 requires both event5 and event4 to hold in that next state; no rule forces both (or either) of those to hold there, and a valid next state is simply {event1}. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false."

Explanation: From the initial event5, the next event can be either event1 or event2. If the next event is event1 then event3 occurs immediately.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Below are the steps you requested.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we start in a state labelled event1).

(I'm treating ""always happens"" as the usual modal/temporal interpretation: ""event4 always happens"" means ""in every possible future/execution starting from the initial state, event4 occurs (eventually)"". If you meant a different formal meaning of ""always"", say so and I can adapt the reasoning.)

2) Transition rules (from the text)
- After event1 → either event2 or event5.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event5.
- After event3 → either event1, event2, or event4.
- After event4 → either event1 or event3.
- After event5 → either event1, event2, or event3.

(Several rules were repeated in the original text; I listed each unique rule once.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" Interpreted as: for every possible execution (path) starting from the initial event1, event4 occurs at some point on that path.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says that C1 is true in all situations (effectively the same as asserting C1 is true given the system). Practically, to decide C2 we need to decide whether C1 is true; if C1 is false then C2 is false.

4) How the conditions relate; evaluation
- Is C1 true? No. Although event4 is reachable in some runs (for example 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 is a valid sequence), it is not guaranteed in every run. There are valid infinite runs that never visit event3 (and hence never visit event4). Example counterexample traces starting from event1 that avoid event3 and event4 forever:
  - Repeated 1↔2 loop: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... (1→2 allowed; 2→1 allowed). This run never reaches event3 or event4.
  - Or repeated 1↔5 loop: 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... (5→1 allowed). This also never reaches event3 or event4.
- Because such runs are allowed by the transition rules, event4 does not occur in all possible executions, so C1 is false.

- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C1 (""event4 always happens"") is false because from the initial state there are valid infinite runs that never reach event4 (e.g. 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... or 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ...). Since C1 is not true, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (i.e., at the start/event0).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event1, event5 must happen.
- After event2, either event3, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event3, either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event5, event2 must happen.
(Notes: some rules were repeated in the statement but these are the distinct constraints.)

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: C1 is true at all times (i.e., event2 never occurs now or ever).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- The initial condition says event5 has happened.
- A transition rule requires that after event5, event2 must happen.
- Therefore event2 does happen (following the rule from the initial event5).
- That contradicts C1 (which states event2 never happens), so C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (at the initial state).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event5: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event4: event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3: no other events can happen. (This is repeated in the context.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” Interpreted as: in the immediate successor state the event that occurs is event4.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreted as: at some future state (possibly not the current one), C1 is true — i.e., there exists a state from which the immediate next event is event4.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial event4, the rule “after event4, event2 must happen” forces the next event to be event2. So C1 is false at the initial state.
- From event2 the only possibilities are event1 or event3.
  - If event3 occurs you reach a terminal state (no further events), and event4 will never occur thereafter.
  - If event1 occurs, the next step must be event2 or event3; if it is event2 you can repeat the event2↔event1 choices indefinitely, never producing event4. There is no rule that leads from event1 or event2 (or event3) to event5, and event5 is the only rule that can produce event4 (“after event5 … event4”).
- Because the only rule that can produce event4 is “after event5 … event4” and nothing in the system ever produces event5, event4 cannot occur again in any future step.

Therefore C1 is false at the initial state (and cannot become true later), so C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The only rule that can produce event4 (again) is ""after event5 -> event2 or event4"", but no rule ever leads to event5 from the reachable states. From the initial event4 the system must do event2 next, then either event1 or event3; those lead only to event2, event1, or termination at event3, so event4 can never occur as the immediate next event at any future state. Therefore C2 is false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (so the current state is a state where event4 holds).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event4: either event2 or event5 must happen next.
- After event2: either event3 or event5 must happen next.
- After event5: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: either event2 or event5 must happen next.
- (The rules “after event5 …” and “after event3 …” are repeated but say the same.)
- After event1: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen next (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 happens and event2 happens.” Interpreting this as a state formula, C1 means a single state in which both event5 and event2 hold simultaneously.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That says that in the immediate successor state (the state right after the current one), both event5 and event2 hold.

4) How the conditions relate + evaluation
- From the initial state (event4), the next state must be either a state with event2 or a state with event5 — but the rules give a choice of one of those, not both at once.
- There is no rule that allows event2 and event5 to both hold in the same single next state. Thus the immediate next state cannot satisfy “event5 and event2” simultaneously.
- (Note: there are paths over two steps that see event5 in one step and event2 in the next step, e.g. event4 → event5 → event2 is allowed. But that does not make C1 true in the immediate next state; it only makes event5 true in the next state and event2 true in the following one.)

Conclusion
- C2 is False. The next state cannot have both event5 and event2 hold together, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

From the initial state event4, the immediate successor must be a state where either event2 or event5 holds (not both), so the next state cannot satisfy ""event5 and event2"" simultaneously. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (i.e. the trace starts with event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event3: event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event5: either event2 or event4 must happen.

(These are nondeterministic choices; at each step one of the listed follow-ups must occur.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens and event1 happens.” This means at some points in the trace both event4 and event1 occur (order not specified).
- C2: “C1 holds and event4 happens.” This is redundant: C2 = (event4 and event1) and event4, which is logically equivalent to (event4 and event1). So C2 is the same condition as C1.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate to the rules, and truth of C2
- C2 is equivalent to C1 (redundant mention of event4).
- Is C2 guaranteed (entailed) by the initial condition plus rules? No — the rules do not force event1 and event4 to both occur in every possible trace, so C2 is not entailed.
- Is C2 possible (satisfiable) given the rules? Yes. One valid trace demonstrating C2:
  - Start: event5 (given).
  - After event5 choose event4 (allowed).
  - After event4 choose event2 (allowed).
  - After event2 choose event1 (allowed).
  This trace contains both event4 and event1, so C2 holds in this possible execution.

Final answer
- C2 is satisfiable/possible (there exists a valid sequence where C2 is true), but it is not guaranteed by the rules (not necessarily true in every trace). C2 is logically equivalent to C1.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 (which is equivalent to ""event4 and event1 occur"") is not guaranteed by the initial condition plus rules — there are valid traces that never include event4 or event1 (e.g. event5 → event2 → event5 ...). It is satisfiable, however (e.g. event5 → event4 → event2 → event1)."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (after X, one of the listed events must happen)
- After event3 → event4 must happen. (3 → 4)
- After event4 → one of {2, 3, 5} must happen. (4 → 2 or 3 or 5)
- After event2 → one of {1, 3, 4, 5} must happen. (2 → 1 or 3 or 4 or 5)
- After event5 → one of {3, 4} must happen. (5 → 3 or 4)
- After event1 → one of {2, 4, 5} must happen. (1 → 2 or 4 or 5)

(Notes: some lines repeated in the context but they state the same transitions.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., along the execution, event1 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is, C2 asserts C1 is false — equivalently, event1 does happen at some point.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the rules starting at event3 we get 3 → 4, then from 4 we may choose 2, 3, or 5. There is no rule that forces event1; event1 can only occur if at some point we take 2 → 1.
- Example where C1 holds (so C2 is false): always choose 4 → 3 (from 4 choose 3), so the trace 3,4,3,4,... never visits event1. So C1 can be true.
- Example where C1 fails (so C2 is true): take 3 → 4 → 2 → 1, so event1 occurs. So C2 can be true.

Conclusion: C2 is not determined by the rules alone. It is possible (true in some executions) but not guaranteed (false in others). So you cannot say C2 is categorically True; it is satisfiable but not entailed.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Explanation: C2 asserts that event1 does occur. From the rules starting at event3 you can loop 3 → 4 → 3 ... forever and never hit event1, so C2 is not guaranteed (though it is possible in some runs). Thus C2 is not entailed, so the correct answer is False."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event5 happened (so at time 0 the occurrence is event5).

2) Transition rules between events (what can happen immediately after each event)
- After event3: no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1: the next event must be either event2 or event5.
- After event2: the next event must be either event1 or event4.
- After event5: the next event must be event1.
- After event4: the next event must be event1, event2, or event5.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; it is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" at the current point/state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That means ""event1 holds at every point in time"" (i.e. in every state along the execution/trace).

4) How they relate and why C2 is False
- To make C2 true we would need event1 to hold at every moment.
- But the initial moment is event5 (given). At that moment event1 is false, so C1 is false at the initial time. Thus C2 already fails.
- Even ignoring the initial state, there are reachable states where event1 is not true. For example consider the valid sequence:
  5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> ...
  This sequence obeys the transition rules (after 5 must come 1, after 1 can come 2, after 2 can come 4, after 4 can come 5, etc.). In this trace there are positions labeled 5, 2, 4 where event1 is not true, so ""event1 holds always"" is false.

Therefore C2 (that C1 always holds) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Justification: initially event5 happens, so event1 is not true at that time; therefore ""event1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3: either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event4: event5 must happen.
- After event5: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event1: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
(Several of these rules were repeated in the description; the above is the set of distinct rules.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual temporal sense: C1 asserts that in every possible execution (from the given initial state) event3 will occur (i.e., every allowed run contains at least one occurrence of event3).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says that the property C1 is true of the system (equivalently: in all executions C1 holds). In short, C2 is the claim that C1 is true for every possible run.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? (analysis)
- To refute C1 it suffices to exhibit a valid execution (following the rules) in which event3 never occurs.
- Starting from the initial event2, choose the transitions that avoid event3:
  - From event2 choose event4 (allowed).
  - From event4 go to event5 (forced).
  - From event5 choose event2 (allowed).
- This yields the infinite cycle: 2 → 4 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 5 → ... .
- This run is valid under the rules and contains no occurrence of event3. Therefore C1 is false (event3 does not necessarily happen in every execution).
- Since C1 is false, the claim ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false.

Final conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event2 you can follow 2 → 4 → 5 → 2 → ... (choices: 2→4 allowed, 4→5 forced, 5→2 allowed), an infinite run with no event3. Thus C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: the initial state is event2 (i.e., ""Initially, event2 happened"").

2) Transition rules (from each event, which events may follow)
- From event2: next is either event1 or event3.
- From event1: next is event2 or event3 or event4.
- From event3: next is event1 or event2 or event5.
- From event4: next is event1 or event2.
- From event5: next is event1 or event3.
(Notes: the problem statement repeats some of these rules; I listed each rule once.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as the usual temporal meaning: in every future step from a given state, the event that occurs is event1 (i.e., event1 holds at every time point).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: after one transition from the initial state, in that next state C1 is true (so from that next state onward event1 must occur at every step).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial state (event2) the possible next states are event1 or event3.
- Check whether C1 holds in those next states:
  - If the next state is event1, the transition rules allow a subsequent step to go to event2 (since from event1 you can go to event2). That means event1 is not guaranteed at every future step from that next state, so C1 is false there.
  - If the next state is event3, the rules allow going to event2 or event5, so again event1 is not guaranteed at every future step; C1 is false there as well.
- Since in the next state (whichever allowed next state we pick) C1 is not true, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: Initially event2 → choose next = event1. From event1 a possible next is event2, so event1 does not hold at every future step; therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false in that next state. Hence C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules (what can happen after each event)
- After event1: next ∈ {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2: next ∈ {event1, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event3: next = event4 (forced).
- After event4: next = event1 (forced).
- After event5: next ∈ {event1, event2, event3}.

(Those are the rules; some were repeated in the statement but amount to the same mappings above.)

Step 3 — meanings of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state” — i.e., from the current state, the immediately following event is event3.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — i.e., in the relevant sense, C1 is true in every applicable situation (for example, from the initial state: in every possible next state, event3 occurs; or globally: at every step the next event is event3). Either way, C2 asserts that event3 is guaranteed as the next event, not merely possible.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial state (event5), the allowed next events are {event1, event2, event3}. So event3 is possible but not forced.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (it may hold on some runs but not on all).
- C2 (that C1 always holds) is false. Counterexample: from initial event5 pick event1 as the next event (allowed by the rules); then C1 is false, so C2 fails.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (start state = event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (allowed next events)
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- After event5 → event4 (only).
(Notes: the context repeated some rules but these are the distinct ones.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 eventually happens.” This can be read in two common ways:
  - Existential reading (∃): there exists some future run from the initial state in which event5 occurs at some time.
  - Universal reading (∀): in every possible future run from the initial state, event5 will eventually occur (i.e. event5 is unavoidable/inevitable).
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” So C2 is the logical negation of C1:
  - Under existential reading of C1, C2 means “no run leads to event5” (i.e. event5 is impossible).
  - Under universal reading of C1, C2 means “there is at least one run that never reaches event5” (i.e. event5 is avoidable).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the graph of transitions you can both reach event5 and avoid it:
  - Example path that reaches event5 (shows C1 true under existential reading): 2 → 4 → 5.
  - Example infinite path that avoids event5 (shows C1 false under universal reading): 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → … (stay in {1,2,3,4} choosing options that avoid 5).
- Therefore:
  - If C1 is interpreted existentially (there exists a run where event5 eventually happens), C1 is true, and C2 is false.
  - If C1 is interpreted universally (event5 must happen on every run), C1 is false (because a run avoiding event5 exists), and C2 is true.

Most natural interpretation for “eventually happens” in questions about inevitability is the universal one (i.e. “will eventually happen on all runs”). Under that reading, C1 does not hold, so C2 is True. If instead the intended meaning was existential possibility, then C2 would be False.

- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (so we start from event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event3, either event1 or event5 must happen. Formally: event3 -> (event1 ∨ event5). (This is a nondeterministic choice.)
- After event1, event3 must happen: event1 -> event3.
- After event5, event4 must happen: event5 -> event4.
- After event4, event5 must happen: event4 -> event5.
- After event2, event1 must happen: event2 -> event1.

- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event5 happens."" Formally: event3 -> event5.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens."" Formally: (event3 -> event5) -> event4. In other words, assuming C1 as an extra axiom, does event4 follow?

Step 4 — how they relate; truth values
- Is C1 entailed by the rules? No. From event3 the rules allow two possibilities: event1 or event5. If event3 leads to event1, then event1 forces event3 again, so you can loop (event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> …) without ever producing event5. Thus event3 -> event5 is not guaranteed by the given rules (there is a model/path where event3 occurs but event5 never does). So C1 is not logically entailed by the rules.
- Is C2 true? Yes. Independent of whether C1 is true, event4 already follows from the initial condition: because event5 happened initially and event5 -> event4, event4 must happen. Therefore the implication (C1 -> event4) is true: event4 holds regardless of C1, so ""if C1 then event4"" is satisfied. Concretely, even without assuming C1, we can derive event4 from the initial event5, so assuming C1 doesn't change that.

2) Transition rules

- After event5 → one of {event1, event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event1 → one of {event4, event5} must happen.
- After event4 → one of {event3, event5} must happen.
(Note: the last rule was repeated but that doesn't change the system.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event4 eventually happens.” This is the claim that at some point (now or later) event4 occurs.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” This is the negation of C1 — i.e., event4 never happens.

4) Relation and conclusion
- Because event4 already happened initially, C1 is satisfied immediately. Therefore C1 is true.
- Since C2 asserts the negation of C1, C2 is false.

(If you interpreted “eventually” as excluding the initial instant, the system still allows event4 to reoccur: event4 → (event3 or event5) → ... → after event5 you can get event4 again. So event4 can occur again in future, but that detail isn’t needed here because the initial occurrence already makes C1 true.)

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Equivalently: in the next state after the current one, event5 does not happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and the answer
- We start after event3. By the rule for event3, the next state must be either event4 or event5.
- If the next state is event5, then C1 (""event5 does not happen"") is false in that next state.
- Because event3 allows the next state to be event5, we cannot guarantee that event5 does not happen in the next state. Thus C2 (that event5 does not happen in the next state) is not guaranteed.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (so we start from a state where event3 has just occurred).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event5 must happen.
- After event5, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event1, event5 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — i.e., along every possible future execution from the current state, event1 will occur at some point.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., starting from the immediate next state (after the next mandatory step), C1 is true there (from that next state, event1 will eventually happen on every continuation).

4) How they relate / analysis
- From the initial event3, the mandated chain forces: event3 -> event4 -> event5 -> event2.
- At event2 there is a nondeterministic choice: either event1 happens next, or event5 happens next.
- If the choice at event2 repeatedly picks event5, the execution can cycle: ..., event5 -> event2 -> event5 -> event2 -> ... forever and never produce event1.
- Therefore there exists a valid infinite execution (for example: 3,4,5,2,5,2,5,2,...) in which event1 never occurs. That shows C1 is not guaranteed (C1 is false as a universal eventuality).
- For C2: the ""next state"" after the initial state will be the state after event4 (since event4 must happen after event3). From that next state the same cycle possibility exists (4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 -> ...), so event1 need not ever occur from that next state either. Hence C1 does not hold in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is False (there is a valid continuation from the next state that never reaches event1).

Reasoning (brief):
- From the initial event4 and the rules: event4 -> event5 -> event1 -> event2, so event4, event5, event1, event2 all occur.
- C1 is the statement ""event2 -> event4"". Whether C1 holds or not, there is no rule that ever produces event3 (the only rule mentioning event3 is event3 -> (event1 or event4), which is an implication leaving event3 as antecedent).
- Therefore assuming C1 true does not produce event3. So ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is not entailed."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (the system starts at event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event3 → event4 must happen. (3 -> 4)
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event5} must happen. (4 -> {1,2,5})
- After event1 → one of {event2, event4} must happen. (1 -> {2,4})
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen. (2 -> {1,3,4})
- After event5 → one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen. (5 -> {1,2,4})

(You repeated the rule for event2; it is the same: 2 -> {1,3,4}.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2
- C1: “Event1 happens or event3 happens.” Interpreted as the proposition that at a given step the current event is either event1 or event3.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreted as “at some future step (possibly now), C1 becomes true” — i.e., eventually the system reaches event1 or event3.

Step 4 — how they relate and decision about C2
- From the start (event4) there are choices. Some choices lead to event1 or event3 (for example 4 → 1 immediately makes C1 true). But the transitions are nondeterministic, so we must check whether every possible future run eventually reaches event1 or event3.
- Exhibit a valid run that never reaches event1 or event3: 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, ... This respects the rules because 4 → 2 is allowed and 2 → 4 is allowed. Along this infinite trace neither event1 nor event3 ever occurs, so C1 never becomes true.
- Therefore C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is not guaranteed in all runs.

Final answer
- C2 is False (there exists a valid execution—e.g. the infinite loop 4,2,4,2,…—in which C1 never holds). 

(If you meant “there exists a run where C1 eventually holds,” that existential version is true, but the universal eventuality is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: start at 4 and choose transitions 4 → 2 and 2 → 4 repeatedly, yielding the infinite trace 4,2,4,2,... This trace respects the rules and never visits event1 or event3, so ""eventually (event1 or event3)"" is not guaranteed."

Summary answer: C2 is not guaranteed (False). Below are the step-by-step details you asked for.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start in a state after event2).

2) Transition rules (restated)
- After event2: either event1 or event4 must happen next.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: event2 must happen next.
- After event4: no further events can happen (sequence ends).
- After event5: either event1, event2, or event4 must happen next.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (This phrase is ambiguous. Two natural readings:
  a) Weak reading: event2 occurs at least once on every possible timeline — i.e., in every possible execution/event sequence, event2 happens somewhere.
  b) Strong reading: event2 holds at all times (an invariant), i.e., at every step/event occurrence the event2 happens.)
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” (Both parts must be true.)

4) How the conditions relate; evaluation
- From the initial event2, the rules force either event1 or event4 next.
- There is a valid continuation where event4 happens immediately after the initial event2. Because event4 forbids any further events, that continuation is: [event2, event4] and then stop.
- In that continuation, event1 does not happen. Therefore “Event1 happens” is not guaranteed.
- Under the weak reading of C1 (event2 occurs at least once in every timeline), C1 is true here because the initial event2 already occurred in every timeline. Under the strong reading (event2 at all times), C1 is false (e.g., after event4 there is no event2).
- Regardless of how you read C1, C2 requires event1 to happen. But we have a valid counterexample trace ([event2, event4]) where event1 does not happen. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (False).

Conclusion: C2 is False (not necessarily true).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start with event2, then take event4 (allowed). Sequence [event2, event4] ends and event1 never occurs, so ""Event1 happens"" is not guaranteed. Hence C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") can be false."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: one of event1, event3, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event3: event5 must happen.
- After event4: one of event1, event2, or event5 must happen.
- After event5: event2 must happen.
(Note: some rules were repeated in the context; listing the unique rules above.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “event2 happens or event4 happens” — i.e., at some point in the sequence, either event2 or event4 occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds and event5 happens” — both that (event2 or event4) occurs and event5 occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true?
- From the initial condition, event5 has occurred.
- The rule “after event5: event2 must happen” implies event2 does happen (after that initial event5).
- Therefore C1 is satisfied (event2 happens).
- Because event5 also did happen initially, both parts of C2 are true: C1 holds and event5 happens.
- Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (we start at event3).

Step 2 — transition rules (after each event, which events may follow)
I list each rule once and note nondeterminism where it applies:
- After event3: event5 must happen. (deterministic: 3 → 5)
- After event5: either event2 or event3 may happen. (nondeterministic: 5 → {2, 3})
- After event2: either event3, event4, or event5 may happen. (2 → {3, 4, 5})
- After event1: either event2, event4, or event5 may happen. (1 → {2, 4, 5})
- After event4: either event1, event3, or event5 may happen. (4 → {1, 3, 5})

(The original list had some rules repeated; I’ve combined duplicates.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event4 happens"" — i.e., at some time point the current event is either 1 or 4.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — usually means: at some future point (possibly now) C1 becomes true. There are two standard readings:
  - Existential reading (∃): there exists at least one possible execution trace in which C1 eventually occurs.
  - Universal/inevitability reading (∀): in every possible execution trace from the initial state, C1 will eventually occur.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and the truth of C2
- From the initial event3 we have a forced transition to event5 (3 → 5).
- From event5 the system can nondeterministically choose event3 (5 → 3). If that choice is taken repeatedly, the system cycles 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... forever.
- That infinite 3–5 loop never includes event1 or event4, so along that execution C1 never holds.

Conclusion about C2:
- Under the universal/inevitability reading (C2 means ""in all executions C1 eventually holds""): C2 is False. Counterexample trace: 3,5,3,5,... never reaches event1 or event4.
- Under the existential reading (C2 means ""there exists an execution where C1 eventually holds""): C2 is True — for example 3 → 5 → 2 → 4 reaches event4 (so C1 holds).

If you mean the usual temporal-logic notion of ""eventually"" as inevitability (i.e., must happen on all traces), then C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: from the initial state 3 the system can loop 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 … indefinitely, never visiting 1 or 4, so C1 is not guaranteed on all executions. (If you intended an existential reading—""there exists a run where C1 holds""—then C2 would be True.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (this is the starting point).

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreting the text)
- After event1 → event4 must occur.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3, event5} must occur.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event5} must occur.
- After event3 → no further events (event3 is terminal).
- After event5 → one of {event2, event3, event4} must occur.

(Notes: the context repeated some rules; I used each rule once.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event4 happens."" This is redundant; C1 just means event4 happens.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Equivalent to: event1 happens OR event4 happens.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation of C2
From the start (event2) the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event5}.

- If the transition chosen is event1: then event1 happens (so C2 is true). Moreover, after event1 event4 must happen, so event4 also happens.
- If the transition chosen is event3: event3 is terminal, so neither event1 nor event4 happens → C2 is false on that run.
- If the transition chosen is event5: then next is one of {event2, event3, event4}.
  - If event5 → event4 (possible), then event4 happens → C2 true.
  - If event5 → event3 (possible), then terminal and C2 false on that run.
  - If event5 → event2, the process can repeat (and may later reach event1 or event4 or may again choose event3 and terminate).

Conclusion (about C2)
- C2 is not guaranteed (not logically entailed) by the initial condition and rules: there exist runs (e.g., event2 → event3) where C2 is false.
- C2 is satisfiable/possible: there also exist runs (e.g., event2 → event1, or event2 → event5 → event4) where C2 is true.

So the correct characterization: C2 is undetermined from the given information — it can be true in some possible executions and false in others. It is not always true.

False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e. at the current/initial state we have event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event3 → next must be one of {event1, event4, event5}.
- After event1 → next must be one of {event3, event4}.
- After event4 → next must be one of {event1, event3}. (This was stated twice but is the same rule.)
- After event5 → next must be one of {event1, event3}.
- After event2 → next must be one of {event1, event4}.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” That asserts the event at the next time step is event2.
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” This requires both that C1 is true (event2 in the next state) and that event2 happens (the extra “and event2 happens” is redundant unless it refers to an additional occurrence; in any case it requires event2 to occur as part of the conjunction).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth values
- From the initial condition (event2 now) and the rule “after event2 → next must be {event1, event4}”, the next event cannot be event2. The next event is constrained to be either event1 or event4.
- Therefore C1 (event2 in the next state) is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is also false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial event: event3 happens first (so the current state after the initial step is the state labeled event3).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must/can follow each event)
- After event3, event5 must happen.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2, event3, event4} happens (choice).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event5} happens.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event5} happens.
(You repeated the rule for event2 twice; both copies are the same.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Interpreting this as a temporal property on executions, it can be read two ways:
  - Existential reading (∃F event1): there exists some future/branch where event1 occurs at some time.
  - Universal/inevitability reading (∀F event1): on every possible future/execution from the current state, event1 eventually occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: starting from the state one step after the initial (i.e., after event3 → event5), C1 is true there (again with the same existential vs. universal ambiguity).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; evaluation
- From the initial event3 we must go to event5 next (3 → 5).
- From event5, event1 is possible (5 → 1), so under the existential reading ∃F event1 holds at event5 (there exists a continuation from 5 that reaches event1).
- However, there is also a continuation that forever avoids event1: 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... (because 5 can choose 3 and 3 must go to 5). This infinite loop never reaches event1, so event1 does not inevitably occur on all futures from event5.

Conclusion — is C2 true or false?
- If C1 is interpreted existentially (there exists a future where event1 happens), then C2 is True (from the next state event5 there is a path to event1).
- If C1 is interpreted universally (event1 must happen on all futures), then C2 is False, because of the counterexample trace 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → ... that never reaches event1.

Most model-checking / inevitability questions use the universal sense of “eventually” (i.e., “eventually in all executions”). Under that common interpretation, C2 is False (counterexample: 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → … never hits event1).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

From 3 we must go to 5. At 5 there is an infinite loop 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → … that never reaches event1, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (in the universal/inevitable sense) does not hold at the next state."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (starting point).

2) Transition rules (nondeterministic choices when an “either” appears)
- After event2, event3 must happen next. (2 → 3)
- After event3, either event2 or event4 must happen next. (3 → {2,4})
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen next. (4 → {1,3})
- After event1, event5 must happen next. (1 → 5)
- After event5, either event1 or event3 must happen next. (5 → {1,3})

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event4 happens and event5 happens.” (Both events occur at some points in the execution.)
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” (Eventually both event4 and event5 will have happened — i.e., in all considered runs/paths, C1 will occur at some time.)

4) How they relate / conclusion
- C1 is possible: e.g. choose 3 → 4 → 1 → 5. That trace contains both 4 and 5, so C1 holds in that run.
- But C1 is not inevitable: from the initial 3 you can always pick 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... indefinitely (since 3 may go to 2, and 2 forces 3 again). That infinite trace never produces 4 or 5, so C1 never holds there.

Therefore C2 (that C1 eventually holds in all executions) is false: C1 can happen but is not guaranteed.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial 3 you can always choose the loop 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... which never reaches 4 or 5, so it's not guaranteed that both 4 and 5 will eventually occur."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (deduplicated)
- After event3 → either event2 or event5.
- After event4 → either event2 or event5.
- After event2 → event5.
- After event5 → either event1 or event2.
- After event1 → event4.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual temporal sense: event3 must occur at every (or in every future) step / on every path (i.e., it is true at all times).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" So C2 is true iff C1 is true and event3 (occurs now/at least once) holds.

Step 4 — how the rules relate and truth value
- From the initial event3, the rules force a move to either event2 or event5. From there the system cycles among {event1, event2, event4, event5} (e.g. 2→5→2→5... or 5→1→4→2→5→...); none of the transition rules ever bring you back to event3.
- Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to occur again (and certainly not at every future step). So C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is also false.

- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (call that time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen immediately after a given event)
- After event1 → event4 must happen.

(Several rules were repeated in the text; the above is the concise set.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Means: at the state immediately after the initial state (time 1), event1 occurs.
- C2: “Event3 happens or C1 holds.” Means: at time 1 either event3 occurs or C1 is true (i.e., event1 at time 1).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth-values
- From the initial condition (event1 at time 0) and the rule “After event1 → event4 must happen,” the next state (time 1) must be event4. Therefore event1 does not occur at time 1, so C1 is false.
- Since the next state is event4, event3 does not occur at time 1 either. So “event3 happens” is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (so the current state is event4).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 → event3 (must happen next).
- After event3 → event2.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event4 → event3.
- After event5 → one of {event2, event4}.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state."" Interpreted relative to the current state: the immediate next event is event5.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means: at some future point along the execution, C1 is true (i.e., there will be a moment when the next state is event5). Equivalently: at some future step the event that occurs next is event5 (or simply: event5 occurs at some future step).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial event4, the next event is forced to be event3 (by the rule after event4 → event3). So C1 (that the next event is event5) is false right now.
- From event3 we must go to event2. At event2 there is a choice; one of the allowed next events is event5, so event5 is reachable (there exists a path where event5 occurs).
- However, event2 also allows going to event3, and from 3 back to 2, so there is a cycle 2→3→2 that can be chosen forever, never going to event5.

Conclusion about C2
- If you ask whether C2 is guaranteed in all executions (i.e., necessarily true), the answer is False: there is an infinite path 4 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... that never produces event5, so C1 never becomes true along that path.
- If you ask whether C2 is possible (i.e., there exists an execution where C1 eventually holds), the answer is True: from 4 → 3 → 2 you can choose event5 at the 2-state and thus make C1 true then.

Given the usual reading (whether C2 holds inevitably), C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (from each event, which events may follow)
- From event4: next must be one of {event1, event3, event5}.
- From event1: next must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- From event3: next must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- From event5: next must be one of {event2, event4}.
- From event2: next must be event4.
(Several rules were repeated in the statement; these are the distinct transitions.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state."" (A statement about the immediate next step from the current state.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting “always” in the usual sense: C1 must hold in every possible next-state situation (i.e., for all possible transitions / runs).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and decision
- From the initial state (event4), the allowed next events are {event1, event3, event5}. Event5 is one possible next event, so C1 can be true in some runs (there exists a next state where event5 happens).
- But C1 is not guaranteed: the system can choose event1 or event3 instead. For example, the transition event4 → event1 is allowed, and in that case C1 is false.

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False. (C1 is possible but not always true.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event4 the next event may be event1, event3, or event5. Since event1 or event3 can occur instead of event5, C1 is not guaranteed in every next-state, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (the system starts in state event4).

2) Transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event1: next ∈ {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event2: next ∈ {event4, event5}.
- After event3: next ∈ {event4, event5}.
- After event4: next ∈ {event1, event3, event5}.
- After event5: next ∈ {event3, event4}.

(Several lines in the context repeat the same rules; the above summarizes them.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the standard way for these transition systems: in every possible run (every possible infinite/finite sequence allowed by the rules starting from the initial state) event1 occurs (i.e., there is no allowed run that never contains event1). (If you intended a different formal meaning of ""always,"" tell me and I will re-evaluate.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This is the logical conjunction: event1 occurs (in at least one run/step) AND C1 is true. If C1 is interpreted as above (a universal statement) then C2 is effectively equivalent to C1 (because C1 already guarantees event1 occurs in every run).

4) How they relate and truth value of C2
- From the transition rules starting at event4, we can produce runs that never include event1. Examples:
  - 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... (always choose the event3 option from event4 and the event4 option from event3). This infinite run contains no event1.
  - 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ... (always choose event5 from event4 and event4 from event5). Also contains no event1.
- Because such allowed runs exist that never include event1, C1 is false (event1 does not occur in every possible run).
- Therefore C2 (which requires C1 to hold) is also false.

Answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false because from the initial event4 there are valid runs with no event1 (e.g. 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ... or 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ...). Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (event1 happens and C1) is also false."

Below I answer the four requested parts step by step and then give the final verdict on C2.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially (the run starts at event1).

2) Transition rules (nondeterministic choices)
- After event5: next is either event1 or event4. (5 -> {1,4})
- After event1: next is either event2 or event5. (1 -> {2,5})
- After event4: next is either event1, event2, or event3. (4 -> {1,2,3})
- After event2: next is event4. (2 -> {4})
- After event3: next is either event1 or event2. (3 -> {1,2})

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event5 eventually happens.” That means there exists some time in the run (possibly later) at which event5 occurs.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event4 happens.” Interpreted as: in any run where event5 occurs at some point, event4 must (eventually) occur in that same run. (So C2 asserts that C1 implies “event4 eventually happens”.)

4) How the conditions relate (and decisive counterexample)
- From the rules we can construct valid runs (sequences of events) by following allowed choices.
- Starting from the initial event1 we can choose the following sequence of choices that respect the rules:
  1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ...
  This is allowed because:
    - From 1 we may go to 5.
    - From 5 we may go to 1.
  This infinite loop contains event5 (so C1 holds for that run) but never contains event4. Therefore there exists a run where C1 is true and event4 never happens.
- Thus C2 (which claims that whenever C1 holds then event4 happens) is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer
- C2 is False. (Counterexample: the infinite run 1,5,1,5,... satisfies C1 but never produces event4.) 

(If you intended a different semantics — e.g., a fairness assumption that prevents indefinitely avoiding some enabled choice — state that and I can re-evaluate under that additional assumption.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: starting at event1 follow 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... (allowed by 1->5 and 5->1). This run contains event5 (so C1 holds) but never contains event4, so C1 does not imply event4. (If fairness assumptions are intended, specify them and I can re-evaluate.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (so “event5 eventually happens” is already true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event2 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → event5 must happen.
- After event5 → either event2 or event4 must happen (non‑deterministic choice).
- After event4 → event5 must happen.
- After event3 → one of event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 eventually happens.” (Given the initial condition, C1 is true.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” Interpreting “event2 happens” as “event2 eventually occurs at some time” (the natural reading).

Step 4 — how they relate, and truth of C2
- C1 is true (event5 already occurred).
- C2 is false in general: the rules allow traces where event5 keeps alternating with event4 forever, never taking the event2 branch. Example trace:
  event5 (initial) → event4 → event5 → event4 → event5 → ... 
  This trace satisfies C1 (event5 occurs repeatedly) but never includes event2, so C2 (that event2 must occur whenever C1 holds) is not guaranteed.
- (Note: if you impose an additional fairness constraint that the choice “event2 vs event4” cannot indefinitely avoid event2, then C2 could become true; but under the plain rules as stated there is no such fairness, so C2 is false.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts in state event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (what can/must follow each event)
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event2: event3 must happen.
- After event3: one of {event1, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event4: one of {event2, event3} must happen.
- After event5: event1 must happen.

(Those are the same rules you gave, condensed.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 always happens.” Interpreting this in the natural way: in every possible allowed execution (every possible infinite trace starting from the initial event1, following the rules), event5 occurs (at least once, or equivalently: it is unavoidable).
- C2: “C1 holds and event5 happens.” This is the conjunction: C1 is true and (in addition) event5 happens (the second clause is redundant if C1 is taken to mean event5 occurs on every execution).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value
- To show C1 is false it suffices to exhibit a valid execution that never includes event5. One such execution is:
  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...
  Check: 1 can go to 2; 2 must go to 3; 3 can go to 1; repeat. This sequence obeys all rules and never includes event5. Therefore event5 is not unavoidable, so C1 is false.
- Since C2 asserts “C1 holds and event5 happens,” and C1 is false, C2 is false as well (a conjunction is false if one conjunct is false). Even if some executions do include event5, that does not make C1 true.

Final answer: C2 is False.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (duplicates removed and written as successor sets)
- After event1 → {event2, event4, event5}
- After event2 → {event1, event4, event5}
- After event3 → {event1, event4, event5}
- After event4 → {event2, event3}
- After event5 → {event1, event2, event3}

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e., the immediate successor state is event4.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as universally true (in the initial state and along all possible transitions), this says: in every state the next state must be event4.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the initial state event1, the possible next states are {event2, event4, event5}. Since event2 and event5 are allowed successors, event4 is not guaranteed as the next state. So C1 is not guaranteed (it may hold on some choices, but not on all).
- Because C1 is not guaranteed even from the initial state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false. A simple counterexample: take the allowed transition event1 → event2; the next state is event2, not event4, so C1 fails there.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial state event1 the possible next states are {event2, event4, event5}, so event4 is not guaranteed (e.g. take event1 → event2). Hence C1 does not always hold, so C2 is false."

Answering step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, one of {event3, event4, event5} must happen next.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event5, event1 must happen next.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (i.e., at no point in the execution does event3 occur.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" In logical form: (event3 does not happen) ⇒ (event3 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and is C2 true or false?
- From the initial condition and the transition rules, event1 has occurred and event1 is terminal, so no further events can occur. Therefore event3 does not occur. So C1 is true.
- C2 asserts that if event3 does not happen then event3 does happen. That is an implication whose antecedent is true (C1) and whose consequent is false (event3 does not happen). A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (deduplicated)
- After event1 → one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event3, event5}.
- After event3 → event4 (only).
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event5 → one of {event3, event4}.

(These are the full non-deterministic transition options given.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event5 happens."" Interpreting this in the temporal/transition context means: whenever event3 occurs in a valid execution, event5 will occur at some later point in that execution.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that for every allowed execution (consistent with the transition rules and initial condition), whenever event3 occurs, event5 will eventually occur.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- From the transitions, event3 must lead to event4, and event4 can lead back to event3. So there is a valid infinite execution that loops 3 ↔ 4 and never includes event5.
- Concrete counterexample trace starting from the given initial event1:
  1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, ... 
  (Choose after event1 → event4; after event4 → event3; after event3 → event4; repeat.)
  This trace contains event3 repeatedly but never contains event5, so C1 (that event5 must happen whenever event3 happens) is false in general.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: starting from event1 choose event4, then event3, then event4, etc.: 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, ... . This valid execution contains event3 repeatedly but never event5, so ""if event3 happens then event5 happens"" does not always hold; hence C2 is false."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event5, event4 must happen.

(Interpreting ""must happen"" as a required next/future event; the conclusion below holds whether we take it as immediate next or eventual.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens"" — there exists some time (possibly the current state) at which event5 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state, it is true that event5 eventually happens from that point on.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the initial state we have event5 (so C1 is true at the initial state).
- The transition after event5 is fixed: next must be event4. From event4 the only possibilities are event1 or event3. If event1 occurs it forces event3 next, and event3 is terminal. Thus all possible continuations from the next state (the state where event4 holds) are:
  - ... → event4 → event3 (terminal), or
  - ... → event4 → event1 → event3 (terminal).
  In neither continuation does event5 occur again.
- Therefore in the next state (after the initial event5), event5 will never occur in the future, so ""event5 eventually happens"" is false there. Hence C2 is false.

(NB: If one used a variant of ""eventually"" that excludes the current state, then C1 would already be false at the initial state; the conclusion that C2 is false still holds.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: Initially event5 holds (so C1 is true now). But the immediate successor must be event4, and from event4 the only continuations are event4→event3 or event4→event1→event3, with event3 terminal. No continuation from that next state ever reaches event5 again, so ""event5 eventually happens"" is false in the next state. Hence C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initially event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules (restated)
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- After event2, no further events can happen (terminal).
- After event4, event1 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: event5 happens AND event4 happens.
- C2: event3 happens AND C1 holds. So C2 means event3 AND event5 AND event4 all occur.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Start: event1 → by rule, next must be event3. So event3 can and does occur.
- From that event3 you can choose event5 (so sequences like 1 → 3 → 5 are possible). From event5 you can then go to event1, event2 (terminal), or event3, so sequences involving 1,3,5 (and looping among 1,3,5) are reachable; event5 is reachable.
- However, no rule makes event4 occur. The rule about event4 only says what must follow if event4 happens (event1 must follow), but nothing permits event4 to be produced from any of the allowed successors. Given the specified transition rules and the initial event1, event4 is unreachable.
- Because event4 cannot occur, C1 (event5 AND event4) is false, and therefore C2 (event3 AND C1) is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (not satisfiable/entailed under the given rules).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event1, only events reachable are 3 (must), then 1 or 5, and from 5 you can go to 1, 2, or 3. No rule ever produces event4, so event4 is unreachable. Therefore C1 (event5 AND event4) is impossible, making C2 false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is the current state).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen next.
- After event2: one of {event1, event5} must happen next.
- After event3: one of {event1, event2, event4, event5} must happen next.
- After event4: event2 must happen next.
- After event5: event3 must happen next.
(Note: “After event5, event3 must happen” was repeated in the context.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens or event5 happens” — i.e., in a given state, event2 ∨ event5 holds.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the immediate successor state to the current one, event2 ∨ event5 is true.

Step 4 — relationship and conclusion
- From the initial state (event1), the next state must be one of event2, event3, or event5.
- C2 would require that the next state be either event2 or event5. But event3 is an allowed next state, so the next state could be event3, which would make C1 false in that next state.
- Concrete counterexample: pick the next state = event3 (allowed). In that next state C1 (event2 ∨ event5) is false.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed) by the rules — C2 is False (it can be false).

Short answer: C2 is False (not guaranteed).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the initial state S0, event2 is true and event4 is false).

2) Transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event1 → {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → {event3, event4, event5}.
- After event3 → {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event4 → {event2}.
- After event5 → {event2, event3, event4}.
(Several lines in the context repeat the same rules; the above is the set of unique rules.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" — i.e., in a given state ¬event4.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, ¬event4 must hold.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At S0 we have event2, so C1 is true at S0 (event4 does not happen there).
- From S0 (event2) the allowed next states are those where event3, event4, or event5 happens.
- Because event4 is one of the allowed next events after event2, there exists a possible next state in which event4 does happen. Therefore the universal claim ""¬event4 holds in the next state"" is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: C2 is False as a necessary/entailed property. (It may hold on some possible next states, but it is not guaranteed for all possible next states.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

From the initial state (event2), a next state with event4 is allowed (after event2 → {event3, event4, event5}), so ¬event4 is not guaranteed in the next state."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event4 → event3 (4 → 3).
- After event3 → one of {1,2,5} (3 → {1,2,5}).
- After event1 → event5 (1 → 5).
- After event2 → one of {3,4} (2 → {3,4}).
- After event5 → one of {1,2,3} (5 → {1,2,3}). (This rule was repeated but that is redundant.)

3) Meaning of the statements
- C1: “If event3 happens, then event2 happens.” Formally 3 → 2 (a universal implication).
- C2: “Event3 happens and C1 holds.” That is (event3 occurs) AND (3 → 2 is true).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- The rules only require that after 3 the next event is one of {1,2,5}. That does not force 2 every time after 3. So C1 (3 → 2) is not entailed by the rules.
- A concrete counterexample trace consistent with the rules: start at 5, choose 3 next, then choose 1 next: 5 → 3 → 1 → 5 → … . This trace is allowed by the rules, it contains event3, but after that occurrence of event3 the next event was 1 (not 2), so the universal claim “if event3 happens then event2 happens” (C1) is false.
- Because C1 is false (not guaranteed), C2 — which requires both that event3 happens and that C1 holds — is false.

(Also note: even event3 is not guaranteed from the start since from 5 you could choose 1 or 2 instead of 3, so the conjunct “event3 happens” is not guaranteed either. Either way, C2 does not hold.)

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initially event3 occurs.

2) Transition rules (graph form)
- 1 -> {3, 5}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 4}
- 5 -> {3, 4}
- 2 -> {1, 4}
- 4 -> {1, 2, 3, 5}

(Repeated lines about event4 are the same rule.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event4 happens."" Interpreting this as a state predicate: C1 holds at a state exactly when the current event is event2 or event4.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting this as the temporal (“always”/globally) claim that at every point in the execution C1 is true (i.e., every state is either event2 or event4).

4) How the conditions relate / evaluation
- At the initial state the current event is event3, so C1 is false immediately (neither event2 nor event4).
- Therefore C2 (that C1 holds at all times) is already falsified by the initial state.
- Stronger counterexample: there is an infinite run 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... (3 can go to 1, and 1 can go back to 3), which never visits event2 or event4, so C1 is false repeatedly along that run.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Brief answer: C2 is not determinable from the rules — it can be either true or false depending on which allowed transitions are taken. It is not forced by the given constraints.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial condition?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens first.

2) Transition rules (after X, the next event must be one of the listed):
- after event1 → {event3, event4, event5}
- after event2 → {event1, event4}
- after event3 → {event2, event4, event5}
- after event4 → {event1, event2, event3}
- after event5 → {event1, event2, event4}

(Several lines in the context repeated these same rules.)

3) What the conditions mean:
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” (i.e., in the whole execution, event2 never occurs).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — equivalently, event2 does happen (C2 is the negation of C1).

4) How they relate / is C2 true or false?
- C1 can hold: there exists an allowed infinite path that never uses event2. Example: 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 4 → … (all transitions are allowed and avoid event2). So it is possible to satisfy the rules while keeping event2 absent; thus C1 is consistent.
- C1 can fail (so C2 can hold): there also exist allowed traces in which event2 occurs, e.g. 1 → 5 → 2 (1→5 allowed, 5→2 allowed), so event2 does happen in that run.

Therefore the rules do not force either truth value. C2 is not provably true (nor provably false) from the information given — its truth depends on which allowed choices are made, so it is undetermined.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C2 asserts that event2 does occur (negation of C1). The rules do not force event2 — there are valid traces that avoid event2 entirely (e.g. 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 → …), so C1 can hold and thus C2 need not hold.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened (call that the current state S0: event3 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 → either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event3 → event4 must happen.
- After event5 → one of event1, event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event4 → one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- After event2 → one of event1, event3, or event5 must happen.
(Notes: two rules were repeated in the statement but they do not change the set of rules.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" — i.e. ¬(event4) holds in the state under consideration.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately after the current state (S1), ¬(event4) holds.

4) How do these conditions relate and final truth value of C2?
- In S0 we know event3 happened. The rule ""after event3 → event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur in the next state S1.
- Therefore in S1 event4 does happen, so ¬(event4) is false in S1.
- Thus C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Summary answer: C2 is False. (C1 is true in the initial state S0, but it does not hold in the next state S1 because event4 must occur after event3.)

Step-by-step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the first event in the run is event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: next must be event4 or event5.
- After event2: next must be event4 or event5.
- After event3: next must be event1 or event2 or event5.
- After event4: next must be event2 or event3 or event5.
- After event5: next must be event4.
(“Must” indicates nondeterministic choice among the listed options.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting this as a universal/invariant property: at every step (every event occurrence) the event that happens is event2. (If you intended a different reading — e.g. “event2 occurs infinitely often” — the conclusion can change; I’ll note that below.)
- C2: “Event5 happens or C1 holds.” That is, in the future either event5 occurs at some time or the invariant C1 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true?
- From the rules we can exhibit a valid run that shows C2 is not guaranteed. Consider the infinite run:
  2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ...
  Each step obeys the rules: after 2 we choose 4; after 4 we choose 2. This run never contains event5, so “event5 happens” is false in this run. C1 (interpreted as “every event is event2”) is also false in this run because many occurrences are event4. Therefore the disjunction “event5 happens or C1 holds” is false in this run.
- Because the rules allow that run, C2 is not entailed by the system (C2 is not guaranteed/ not necessarily true).

Notes on alternative readings:
- If by C1 you meant “event2 occurs infinitely often” (rather than “at every step”), that weaker C1 is true in the example run above (event2 recurs infinitely often). In that reading C2 (“event5 happens or event2 occurs infinitely often”) would be true for that run, but you must check all possible runs to conclude C2 as a system-wide guarantee. There are other runs where event5 happens, and there are runs like the 2–4 loop where event2 recurs infinitely often — so that alternative C2 might be true of every run, but your original phrasing (“Event2 always happens”) is best read as the stronger invariant, for which C2 is not true.

Final answer (with original phrasing): C2 is not guaranteed (i.e., not true in all possible runs).

Answer up front: C2 is False. It is not guaranteed by the given rules.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and the initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event4, one of {event1, event5} must happen.
- After event5, one of {event2, event3} must happen.

(“After X, Y must happen” means: whenever X occurs, later Y (or one of the listed options) will occur.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (There exists some time in the future when event1 occurs.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event4 happens.” (Formally: C1 ⇒ (event4 eventually happens).)

4) How these conditions relate / logical evaluation
- From the initial event3 and the rule “after event3, event1 must happen,” we deduce event1 will indeed happen. So C1 is true (forced by the rules).
- Once event1 happens, the rule “after event1, event3 must happen” forces event3 again. The pair of rules (3 → 1 and 1 → 3) create a forced cycle: 3,1,3,1,... . This infinite alternation satisfies the rules for events 1 and 3 and does not require any occurrence of event2, event4, or event5.
- Because there is a model (the infinite 3–1 cycle) in which C1 holds but event4 never occurs, the implication C1 ⇒ (event4 happens) is not valid. In other words, C2 is not guaranteed by the given rules.

Conclusion: C1 is true; C2 is false (there exist valid executions where C1 holds and event4 never happens).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (what may follow each event)
- After event2: either event1, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3: event2 must happen.
- After event5: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event4: either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (read as: in any execution where event1 occurs, event2 also occurs in that execution.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (the negation of C1 — i.e., there is some execution in which event1 happens but event2 does not.)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Because the run always starts with event2, event2 has occurred in every possible execution (at least at the start).
- Also, the only rule that allows event1 to occur is the rule “after event2 → event1, event3, or event5.” No rule allows event1 to follow any event other than event2, so whenever event1 occurs it is immediately preceded by (and thus occurs in an execution that contains) event2.
- Therefore C1 is true: whenever event1 happens, event2 does occur in that execution.
- Hence C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold) is false.

(If one instead interprets C1 as “after event1, event2 must happen,” that interpretation would be false because event1 is terminal. Under the natural reading “if event1 occurs in a run then event2 occurs in that run,” C1 is true and so C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===

- Initial condition: at the current state (call it time 0), event4 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event5 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event4 → either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1 → either event3, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event2 → either event1 or event5 must happen.

These are nondeterministic ""either/or"" obligations: they constrain what must follow an event but do not force a unique next event.

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" (i.e., in the next state both event4 and event2 happen, or more precisely C1 is true and event2 also occurs).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial event4, the transition rule ""after event4 → either event1 or event3"" gives the set of possible next events: event1 or event3. Neither of those forces event4 in the next state. So event4 in the next state is not guaranteed.
  - Therefore C1 is not necessarily true (it is not entailed).
  - Because C2 requires C1 and also event2, and there is no rule producing event2 from the given initial state or transitions, C2 is also not entailed.
- Concretely, a simple counterexample showing C2 false: pick the next event to be event3 (allowed by the rule after event4). Then C1 is false (event4 did not occur next), and event2 did not occur either — so C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (not guaranteed / not provable from the given information).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: {event1, event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- Initial condition: event3 happens initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
Interpreting each ""After X, either ... must happen"" as a nondeterministic transition, the rules are:
- after event3 → event1 (the given line is repeated but it enforces the same rule)
- after event1 → event2 or event4
- after event2 → event1 or event4
- after event4 → event1 or event2 or event3
- after event5 → event1 or event2 or event4

(Several rules were repeated in the statement; I listed each unique rule once.)

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens"" — there exists some reachable future state in which event5 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state (the next event after the initial one), C1 is true (i.e., from that next state, event5 will eventually happen).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the initial event3, the next event is forced to be event1 (because after event3 → event1).
- From event1 you can only go to event2 or event4.
- From event2 you can only go to event1 or event4.
- From event4 you can only go to event1, event2, or event3.
- None of these transitions ever produce event5 as a successor. The only rule that mentions event5 is what happens after event5, but no rule allows reaching event5 from any of the reachable events {1,2,3,4}.
- Therefore event5 is unreachable from the initial state (and from any reachable future state). So C1 is false (event5 never happens).
- Since C1 is false in every reachable state, it is also false in the next state; hence C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event3 the next event is event1, and the reachable events thereafter are only {event1, event2, event3, event4}. There is no transition that ever produces event5, so C1 is false (event5 never happens). Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (what can follow each event)
- After event1 → either event3 or event4.
- After event2 → either event1, event3, or event4.
- After event3 → either event1 or event4.
- After event4 → either event1, event2, or event5.
- After event5 → no events (terminal).
(Notes: a couple of rules were duplicated in the text; the set above is the distinct set.)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this as a claim about all runs/traces: whenever event1 occurs (at some point), event2 will occur at some (later) point in that run.
- C2: ""Event5 happens or C1 holds."" This is a disjunction: either there is an occurrence of event5 in the run, or the universal implication C1 is true in the run.

Step 4 — how they relate; truth value of C2
- From the transition graph you can follow a run that never reaches event2 or event5: e.g. choose the nondeterministic choices 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... forever. That run:
  - Contains event1 many times but never contains event2, so C1 is false in that run.
  - Never contains event5, so ""Event5 happens"" is false in that run.
- Therefore the disjunction in C2 is false in that run. Hence C2 is not guaranteed by the given rules (C2 is false as a property of the system).

(For contrast: some runs do make C2 true — e.g. 1 → 4 → 5 makes ""Event5 happens"" true — but because there exists a run where neither disjunct holds, C2 is not universally true.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (duplicates in the text are the same rules)
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen. (1 -> {2,3})
- After event2: either event1, event3, or event5 must happen. (2 -> {1,3,5})
- After event3: event5 must happen. (3 -> {5})
- After event5: event4 must happen. (5 -> {4})
- After event4: event3 must happen. (4 -> {3})

From these rules there is a deterministic cycle 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4. The rules for events 1 and 2 exist but are never reachable from that cycle.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreted as: in every possible continuation from the given initial state, event2 occurs (i.e., event2 necessarily happens at some point).
- C2: “Event3 happens and C1 holds.” That means both (a) event3 occurs (at least once) and (b) C1 is true.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth values
- From the initial event4, the only possible transitions are 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> ...; we never have any transition that leads to event2 or event1. Thus event2 does not occur in any possible run starting from the given initial condition.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not always happen — in fact it never happens here).
- Event3 does occur (4 -> 3), but C2 requires both event3 and C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events appearing: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event4 happened (so we are at a state whose last event was event4).

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreting “After eventX, either … must happen” as “the next event after X must be one of the listed”)
- After event2 → next must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1 → next must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event3 → next must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- After event4 → next must be one of {event1, event2}.
- After event5 → next must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.

(Notes: the context repeats some rules, but they are the same constraints each time.)

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” That is, given the current state (where event4 just happened), the immediate next event is event4.
- C2: “C1 holds and event4 happens.” This is a conjunction: C1 is true AND (again) event4 happens. (Interpreting literally, C2 asserts that the next event is event4 and event4 occurs — which is redundant; either way it requires the next event to be event4.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth-values
- From the transition rules: since the current (initial) event is event4, the allowed next events are only event1 or event2. Event4 is not among the allowed next events.
- Therefore C1 is false (event4 cannot be the immediate next event).
- Since C2 requires C1 to be true (and also event4 to happen), C2 is also false.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Reason: Initially event4 occurred and the rule ""After event4 → next must be one of {event1, event2}"" forbids event4 as the immediate next event, so C1 is false and thus C2 (which requires C1) is also false."

- After event1: next ∈ {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event2: next = event4 (must happen).
- After event3: next ∈ {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event5: next ∈ {event2, event3, event4}.

(Notes: some lines in the context were repeated but these are the distinct rules.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state."" This is a claim about the immediate successor of the current state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: in every situation considered (every reachable state where we ask about the next state), the next state is event5 — i.e., event5 must be the next event in all possible transitions.

4) How these relate and the truth of C2
- From the initial state (event3), allowed next events are {event2, event4, event5}.
- C1 (that event5 happens next) is not guaranteed: event5 is one possible next event but event2 or event4 could happen instead. So C1 is true in some possible executions but false in others.
- Because C1 does not hold in all possible next-state choices, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (start at event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (from each event, the possible next events)
- From event1 → {event2, event3, event5}.
- From event2 → {event3, event4}.
- From event3 → {event1, event4}.
- From event4 → {event2, event3, event5}.
- From event5 → {event4}.

(Notes: a couple of rules were repeated in the statement; I merged duplicates.)

Step 3 — meanings of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event5 eventually happens.” Interpreted naturally as the claim that, starting from the initial state, event5 will necessarily occur at some future point on every possible run (i.e., inevitability).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (the negation of C1).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- To show C1 false it suffices to exhibit a possible infinite execution starting at event1 that never visits event5. One such loop is:
  event1 → event2 → event3 → event1 → event2 → event3 → ... 
  This follows allowed transitions (1→2, 2→3, 3→1) and never visits event5. Therefore event5 is not inevitable.
- Hence C1 (inevitability of event5) is false, so C2 (its negation) is true.

Remark about ambiguity: if C1 were intended in the existential sense (“there exists a run where event5 eventually happens”), then C1 would be true (e.g., the single-step 1→5). But under the usual reading for “eventually happens” as an inevitability property, C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: currently (initially) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules (from each event, what the next state may be)
- After event1 → next ∈ {event2, event3, event5}
- After event2 → next ∈ {event3, event4, event5}
- After event3 → next = event2

- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state.” (i.e., next ∈ {event3}.)
- C2: “C1 does not hold,” i.e., “Event3 does NOT happen in the next state.” (next ∉ {event3}.)

4) How they relate / conclusion about C2
- From the initial state event2, the allowed next events are {event3, event4, event5}.
- So event3 is one possible next event but not the only one.
  - If the chosen next event is event3, C1 is true and C2 is false.
  - If the chosen next event is event4 or event5, C1 is false and C2 is true.

Therefore C2 is not determined (it is contingent): it can be true in some possible next-state choices and false in others. In logical terms: C2 is satisfiable but not entailed by the premises.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Explanation: From initial event2 the next state may be event3, event4, or event5. Because event3 is a possible next event, the claim ""event3 does NOT happen next"" is not guaranteed; it can be false in the branch where event3 occurs. Hence C2 is not entailed and so is False."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (start state = event2).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must/ may happen after each event)
- after event2: either event3 or event4 must happen (2 -> {3,4}).
- after event3: event5 must happen (3 -> 5).
- after event4: either event1 or event5 must happen (4 -> {1,5}).
- after event5: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen (5 -> {1,2,3}).
- after event1: event2 must happen (1 -> 2).

(Notes: a couple of rules were repeated in the problem statement; I treated them as identical.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens."" I interpret this as: at some future point in the execution, event5 occurs.
  - Two common readings:
    - universal/inevitability reading: event5 occurs on every possible execution (for all runs).
    - existential/possibility reading: there exists some execution in which event5 occurs.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since event2 has already happened initially, C2 reduces to C1 under the usual reading that ""event2 happens"" is already satisfied at the start. So C2 is true exactly when C1 is true.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C1 (and therefore C2) guaranteed?
- There exist executions that reach event5. Example choices: from 2 choose event3, then 3 -> 5, so 5 occurs. So under the existential reading, C1 is true (possible).
- But C1 is not guaranteed on every possible execution. Counterexample (infinite avoidance of event5):
  - Start at 2, choose 4.
  - From 4 choose 1 (instead of 5).
  - From 1 must go to 2.
  - Repeat: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... forever.
  - This loop never visits event5, and is allowed by the nondeterministic rules.
- Therefore:
  - Under the universal/inevitability interpretation (""event5 eventually happens on all runs""): C1 is false, and hence C2 is false.
  - Under the existential/possibility interpretation (""there exists a run where event5 happens""): C1 is true, and hence C2 is true (but trivial because event2 already happened).

Final answer to your direct question ""C2 is True or False?"":
- If you mean ""true on all possible executions"" (inevitably), C2 is False (not guaranteed).
- If you mean ""true in some execution"" (possibly), C2 is True (there is a run where event5 occurs, and event2 already happened).

- After event4: event1 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event5 does not happen.” (i.e. event5 never occurs in any valid sequence)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event5 happens.” Formally: (event5 does not happen) → (event5 happens). This is a conditional whose antecedent is C1 and consequent is “event5 happens.”

4) How the conditions relate and final verdict
- Starting from the initial event4, the rules force event1 next (from event4 → event1). From event1 you get either event2 or event3; from event2 you get event3; from event3 you get one of event1, event2, event4. All transitions only produce events from the set {event1, event2, event3, event4}. There is no rule that ever produces event5, and the initial event is not event5. Therefore event5 is unreachable and never happens — C1 is true.
- C2 is the conditional (¬P → P) with P = “event5 happens.” Since ¬P is true (event5 does not happen) but P is false, the conditional is false. Equivalently, ¬P → P is true exactly when P is true; here P is false, so C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition

- Initial condition: event3 has happened (this is the current/last event).

- After event3: either event2 or event4 must happen next.
- After event2: either event1, event4, or event5 must happen next.
- After event4: no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event5: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen next.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event4 happens in the next state.” (i.e., the immediate next event after the current event3 is event4.)
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” (both: event1 happens at some point, and C1 is true — specifically the next event is event4.)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the rules, since the last event is event3, the immediate next event must be either event2 or event4.
  - If the next event is event4, then C1 is true. But event4 is terminal (no further events can happen), and event1 has not occurred previously (initial was event3), so event1 cannot occur either before or after that next state. Thus in this case C2 is false.
  - If the next event is event2, then C1 is false (since the next event is not event4). Event1 might happen later from event2 → event1, but C1 would not hold. So C2 is also false in this case.
- There is no allowed path in which the next event is event4 (making C1 true) and event1 also happens (either before or after), because event1 did not happen before the current state and event4, once it occurs, prevents any further events.

Final answer: C2 is False. (C1 is possible but not guaranteed; C2 cannot be satisfied under the given rules.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules (what can follow each event)
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event2: no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3: either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event4: event3 must happen.
- After event5: either event2 or event4 must happen.

(Notes: some rules in the prompt were repeated; these are the unique rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event2 happens."" Interpreted as: in the run under consideration, both event4 and event2 occur (at some points).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as the universal claim that C1 is true in the given system (i.e., in the actual run(s) allowed by the rules, C1 holds).

Step 4 — how the rules determine truth of C1 and C2
- Because the initial state already has event2 and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" makes event2 terminal, no further events can ever occur in the given starting situation. In particular, event4 cannot occur after the initial event2.
- Therefore C1 is false in the actual system (event2 did happen but event4 does not).
- Since C1 is not even true in the initial/allowed run, the universal claim C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has already happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event4: either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event1: event2 must happen.
- After event5: either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event3: event4 must happen.

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" (Interpretation: whenever event1 occurs, event4 occurs as well at some point. The natural reading in this temporal setting is that event4 must occur after/eventually following event1.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — i.e., C1 is false.

Step 4 — how they relate / evaluation
- Starting from the initial event4, one possible path is: 4 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... (after 4 choose 1; after 1 you must go to 2; after 2 you may choose 1, and repeating that choice yields an infinite 1–2 loop).
- In that run, event1 does occur, but event4 does not occur again after that (the run stays in the 1–2 cycle and never returns to 4). Thus, under the temporal reading “if event1 happens then event4 happens (after it)”, C1 is false because we have a counterexample run where event1 happens but event4 never happens afterwards.
- (Note: if one instead interprets C1 non‑temporally as “if event1 happens at any time then event4 happens at some time in the same run” then C1 would be true here because event4 already occurred initially. But the standard reading with the given ""after"" rules is the temporal one.)

Conclusion
- Under the intended temporal reading of the rules, C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: starting from event4, follow 4 → 1 → 2 and always choose the 2 → 1 transition to obtain the infinite run 4,1,2,1,2,1,... In that run event1 occurs but event4 never occurs afterwards, so ""if event1 happens then event4 happens (after it)"" is false; hence C2 is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so the system starts in a state where event1 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules (read as obligations on what can happen immediately after an event)
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event5, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event1 happens."" (Both events occur in the run; order not specified by the statement of C1.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That is, at some point (now or later) C1 is true — i.e., there is a point in the execution where both event3 and event1 have occurred (or are true simultaneously, depending on interpretation).

Step 4 — how these relate and final verdict
- Because the initial state already has event1, and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes event1 terminal, no further events can occur after the initial state.
- Therefore event3 cannot occur at any later time after the initial event1.
- The only way C1 could be true is if event3 already occurred at the same time as the initial event1 (i.e., simultaneous occurrence). Under the usual sequential reading where events are ordered and initial event1 is already true before any other event, that simultaneous occurrence is not allowed/assumed.
- Thus, under the standard sequential interpretation, C1 cannot become true in the future, so C2 is False.

(If you intended a different semantics — e.g., events can occur simultaneously, or ""after"" means something weaker — say so and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

Answering each part step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (i.e. the system starts with event5 having occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event5, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
(Note: the “after event2/no other events” and “after event3/no other events” rules were repeated in the context; they are redundant.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event4 eventually happens” — i.e. at some point in the future (after the initial state) event4 occurs.
- C2: “Event5 happens and C1 holds” — the conjunction that event5 occurs and event4 eventually occurs. (No C3 was given in the hypothesis.)

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- From the initial condition and rules we must follow: starting from event5, event1 must occur next, and then either event2 or event3 occurs, and both event2 and event3 are terminal (no further events allowed). That yields the only possible sequences: event5 → event1 → event2 (end) or event5 → event1 → event3 (end).
- There is no rule forcing or allowing event4 to occur at any point in those sequences (and the terminal nature of event2/event3 prevents later events). The rule “after event4 ...” does not make event4 occur; it only constrains what would follow if event4 did occur.
- Therefore C1 is false (event4 does not eventually happen under the given rules), and although event5 does happen, the conjunction C2 is false because C1 is false.

Final answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
C2 is False.

Starting from the initial event5, the only possible sequences are event5 → event1 → event2 (end) or event5 → event1 → event3 (end). Neither allows event4 to occur, so C1 is false and therefore C2 (event5 and C1) is false."

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed true (it is not entailed by the given rules). It can be true in some possible executions and false in others.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: Initially, event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
(Condensed, since the input repeats the same rules.)
- After event4 → one of {event1, event2, event3, event5}.
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event5}.
- After event2 → event3 (must happen).
- After event3 → one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event4}.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event5 happens or event4 happens (i.e., eventually one of {4,5} occurs).
- C2: event4 happens or C1 holds. Logically C2 = event4 ∨ (event5 ∨ event4) which simplifies to event4 ∨ event5 — i.e., C2 is the same as C1.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and is C2 True or False?
- Since C2 is equivalent to C1, the question reduces to whether the rules force that event4 or event5 must eventually occur.
- Counterexample showing C1 (and thus C2) need not hold: start at event2 → event3 → choose event2 → event3 → event2 → ... This infinite 2↔3 loop satisfies all transition rules but never reaches event4 or event5. So C1 is not entailed, and C2 is not entailed.
- Example where C1/C2 do hold: event2 → event3 → event1 → event5 (or → event3 → event4) produces event5 or event4. So C1/C2 can be true in some executions.

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true given the rules (it is satisfiable but not entailed).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 simplifies to ""event4 or event5"". This is not entailed by the rules because there is a valid execution that never reaches 4 or 5: start at event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... (repeating), which obeys all transition rules but never produces event4 or event5. Hence C2 is not guaranteed (though it is satisfiable in some executions)."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at time 0 event1 is true; event5 is not stated as true initially).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event1: event4 must happen next.
- After event4: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: either event1, event2, or event4 must happen next.
- After event2: either event1 or event5 must happen next.
- After event5: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen next.

(One rule — “After event4, either event2, or event3 must happen” — was repeated; treat it as the same constraint.)

Step 3 — meanings of C1 and C2
- C1: “Event1 happens and event5 happens.” Interpreted in the simplest reading, C1 is the proposition that both event1 and event5 hold at the same state (or, if intended as an existential statement, that both events occur at some points in the run).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” This means that at every time point (globally) C1 is true. Under the simultaneous-state reading, C2 says: at every time both event1 and event5 hold. Under the existential reading “both occur sometime,” C2 would mean “at every time point it is already true that both events have (somewhen) occurred” — which is still a very strong requirement that fails at the start.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final decision
- At time 0 we know event1 is true and event5 is not asserted. Therefore C1 (both event1 and event5) is already false at the initial time under the natural simultaneous-state reading.
- Since C1 is false at the initial time, “C1 always holds” (C2) is false immediately.
- Even under the looser reading that C1 means “both events occur sometime in the run,” C2 would require that this fact already holds at every time; that too fails at time 0 (event5 has not yet occurred).

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (i.e., the system starts at a state after event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event5: one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- After event1: no other events can happen (terminal state).
- After event2: one of {event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3: event5 must happen.
- After event4: event5 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event5 always happens."" Interpreting this in the usual temporal/system sense means: in every reachable state of every possible execution, event5 holds (i.e., event5 occurs indefinitely / is invariant). (Note: if you meant “event5 happened at least once,” that is trivially true because it is the initial event; I adopt the stronger interpretation used in these problems.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" Under the same global interpretation this means: either event5 is always true in all runs (C1), or event4 occurs (presumably meaning: in all runs? or at least once? — below I use the standard universal meaning: the disjunction must hold in every possible execution).

Step 4 — how the rules determine C1 and C2
- There is a concrete execution (choice) consistent with the rules: start at event5 (initial), then choose event1 (allowed because after event5 one of {event1,event2,event4} must happen). After event1 the run terminates (no more events).
- On that run: event5 does not ""always happen"" (it happened initially but the next/terminal state is event1, so event5 is not present forever). Also event4 never occurs on that run.
- Therefore:
  - C1 (event5 always happens in every execution) is false — the event5→event1 run is a counterexample.
  - Because C1 is false and there exists a run where event4 does not occur, the formula ""C1 or event4 happens"" is also false under the universal reading (it fails on the event5→event1 run).

Final answer
- Under the standard interpretation that these properties must hold in all possible executions, C2 is False.

Remark about ambiguity
- If you instead meant ""C2 = (C1) OR (there exists some run where event4 happens)"" (i.e., the second disjunct is an existential possibility), then C2 would be true because from the initial event5 you can choose event4 next. Make sure to pick the intended universal vs existential reading; with the usual universal/verification reading used above, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: run event5 → event1. Here C1 (""event5 always happens"") is false (event5 does not hold after the transition) and event4 does not occur, so the disjunction C1 ∨ event4 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so we consider the next state(s) after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (what may happen after each event)
- After event1: either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event2: either event3, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event3: either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event5: either event1, event2, or event3 must happen.

(Note: the context repeats some rules, but these are the distinct transitions.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state."" (a claim about the immediate successor of the initial event1)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event4 happens."" Interpreting ""event4 happens"" the same way as C1 (i.e., in the next state), C2 means: either event5 is the next event, or event4 is the next event.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final decision
- From the rule for event1, the next event must be either event2 or event5.
- Therefore:
  - If the next event is event5, C1 is true and thus C2 is true.
  - If the next event is event2, then neither C1 (event5 next) nor ""event4 happens next"" is true (event4 is not an allowed immediate successor of event1), so C2 is false in that case.
- Because both outcomes (event2 or event5) are allowed after event1, we cannot deduce that C2 must hold in all possible executions.

Answer to ""C2 is True or False?"":
- C2 is not guaranteed (not logically entailed) by the given information. It is possible (true in some runs when event5 occurs next) and possible to be false (if event2 occurs next). If you mean “provably true” from the rules, the correct answer is: False (not guaranteed).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From event1 the next event may be event2 or event5. C2 requires the next event to be event5 or event4; event4 is not allowed after event1, so only event5 would make C2 true. Because event2 is also possible, C2 is not guaranteed."

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed true. It is satisfiable (true in some possible event sequences) but not entailed (there are possible sequences where it is false).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
- After event3, event5 must happen.
(Repeated rules in the context are duplicates and do not change the meaning.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens"" (i.e., at some point event1 ∨ event3 occurs).
- C2: ""Event4 happens and C1 holds"" (i.e., both event4 occurs and (event1 ∨ event3) occurs).

4) How do these conditions relate and what can we conclude?
- Start: event2 → event5 (forced).
- From event5 there is a nondeterministic choice: event1 or event2 or event4.
  - If the choice is event1: then event1 → event4, so event4 occurs and event1 occurs, hence C1 true and event4 true ⇒ C2 true.
  - If the choice is event4: event4 occurs; then event4 → one of {event1,event2,event3}. If that later yields event1 or event3 then C1 holds and with event4 we again have C2 true. But the choice could instead be event2 and loop, avoiding event1/event3.
  - If the choice is event2: we loop (event2 → event5 → …) and could repeatedly pick event2 forever, never producing event1, event3, or event4.
- Therefore there exist executions where C2 becomes true, and there exist executions where C2 never becomes true.

Conclusion: C2 is satisfiable (possible) but not guaranteed. So you cannot conclude C2 is necessarily True; it could be False in some possible behaviors.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Answer: C2 is True — under the normal reading below.

Step‑by‑step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event4 → either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1 → either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event2 → either event1, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event3 → no further events (terminal).
- After event5 → event1 must happen.

3) Meaning of the sub‑conditions
- C1: “Event5 always happens.” Interpreting this in the standard way used in trace/reachability reasoning: in every possible execution (every possible future sequence consistent with the rules) event5 occurs at least once.
- C2: “Event5 happens and C1 holds.” (Conjunction of “event5 happens” and “event5 always happens”.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because the initial condition already states event5 has happened, every possible execution (every trace) includes an occurrence of event5 (at the start). Under the standard interpretation of C1 (event5 occurs in every trace), C1 is true.
- If C1 is true, then the conjunction “event5 happens and C1 holds” is also true (the first conjunct holds because of the initial event5; the second by the argument above). Therefore C2 is true.

Note on alternate reading: If by “always happens” one instead meant “happens at every time step” (i.e., event5 occurs at every point in time), then C1 would be false (after the initial event5 the next event must be event1, so event5 does not hold at that later step), and therefore C2 would be false. The usual intended reading in these problems is the first one (occurs in every trace), so C2 = True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the initial condition says event5 has happened in every possible execution, so C1 (""event5 always happens"" under the usual trace reading = occurs in every trace) is true. The conjunct ""event5 happens"" is also true (it happened initially), so C2 (their conjunction) is true. 

(If ""always happens"" were read as ""at every time point,"" C1 and hence C2 would be false.)"

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules (read: “after X, one of the following must happen”)
- After event4: either event1 or event3.
- After event1: either event3 or event5.
- After event3: either event1, event2, or event4.
- After event5: either event3 or event4.
- After event2: either event1, event3, or event4.
(You listed the rules for event3 and event2 twice; they are the same each time.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event4 happens.” Interpreted as a universal implication: whenever event1 occurs, event4 must occur (at some subsequent point).
- C2: “C1 holds and event3 happens.” So C2 is true iff both (a) C1 is true and (b) event3 actually occurs (at some point).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation
- C1 is false. Counterexample run consistent with the rules that shows C1 fails:
  event2 -> event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> ...
  This is allowed because:
  - After event2 we may choose event1.
  - After event1 we may choose event3.
  - After event3 we may choose event1.
  Repeating 1↔3 never forces event4 to occur, so event1 can occur without any event4 ever happening. Thus “if event1 then event4” does not hold universally.
- Because C1 is false, C2 (which requires C1 to hold) is false regardless of whether event3 can occur or not. (For completeness: event3 can indeed occur in some runs, but C2 requires the conjunction with C1.)

Final answer: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 is false because of a valid run event2 -> event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> ... (1 can occur indefinitely without any event4), so C2 (C1 and event3) is false."

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed (so, effectively False as an entailed claim). Below is a step-by-step breakdown.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event3 → either event2 or event5. (3 → 2 ∨ 5)
- After event2 → either event3 or event4. (2 → 3 ∨ 4)
- After event5 → either event1, event2, or event4. (5 → 1 ∨ 2 ∨ 4)
- After event4 → event1. (4 → 1)
- After event1 → either event2 or event3. (1 → 2 ∨ 3)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Given the context this can be read as “(event3 ∨ event2) holds.”
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 = event1 ∧ (event3 ∨ event2).

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- C1: True. Because event2 has already happened initially, the disjunction (event3 ∨ event2) is satisfied.
- C2: Not guaranteed (not entailed). C2 requires event1 to happen. From the initial event2, the next event could be event3 or event4. There exist valid continuations that never produce event1, for example:
  - event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... (looping between 2 and 3). This sequence respects all rules and never reaches event1.
  - Therefore event1 does not necessarily happen, so C2 (event1 ∧ C1) is not guaranteed to be true.
- It is possible to get event1 in some runs (e.g., event2 → event4 → event1), but possibility is not the same as necessity. Since the context does not force event1, C2 is not entailed.

Conclusion: C1 is true (due to the initial event2); C2 is not necessarily true (so answer: False as a guaranteed/entailed statement).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (we start after event4).

2) Transition rules
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" — this is equivalent to just ""Event3 happens"" (P or P = P).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., ""Event3 happens always"" (for all executions / at all relevant points, depending on interpretation). In practice this means: in every possible run consistent with the rules, event3 must occur (or be true whenever required by the semantics of 'always').

4) Relation and conclusion
- From the rules we can produce a run that never includes event3: start at event4 (initial) → event2 (forced) → event1 (allowed choice from event2) → stop (event1 is terminal). In this execution event3 never happens, so C1 is false on that run.
- Because there exists at least one valid run where C1 does not hold, C1 is not always true.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened. Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So the initial state (where event1 has occurred) has no successor state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 → either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event3 → either event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event5 → either event2 or event3 must happen. (This rule was stated twice but is the same rule.)
- After event4 → no other events can happen.
- After event1 → no other events can happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state."" Interpreted relative to the current (initial) state: C1 asserts that in the immediate successor state event5 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This means: in the successor state of the current state, C1 is true — i.e. there is a successor-of-successor in which event5 occurs (equivalently, event5 would occur two steps ahead of the current state).

Step 4 — evaluation and relation
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, the initial state has no successor state. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (there is no ""next state"" in which event5 could occur).
  - C2 is false (there is no next state in which to evaluate C1, and certainly no two-step-ahead state where event5 occurs).
  
Conclusion: C2 is False.

- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That is, starting from the current state, the immediately next event is event2 or event3.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Starting from the initial event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}. So the next event could be event2 or event3, but it could also be event4 or event5.
- Because event4 (or event5) is a permitted next event, C1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state. For a concrete counterexample: take the run event1 → event4. In that next state the event is event4, so C1 is false there, hence C2 is false (not satisfied universally).

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 happened (i.e., event5 occurs at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → either event4 or event5.
- After event4 → either event1, event3, or event5.
- After event5 → either event1 or event4. (stated twice)
- After event3 → either event1, event4, or event5.
- After event2 → event5.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event5 does not happen."" (No occurrence of event5.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" i.e., event2 occurs AND event5 does not occur.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- The initial fact says event5 happened. That directly contradicts C1, so C1 is false.
- Separately, there is no rule that produces event2 after any event (no transition has event2 as a possible successor), and event2 is not stated to happen initially; therefore event2 cannot be derived as happening.
- Because C1 is false (and event2 cannot be shown to happen), the conjunction in C2 (""event2 happens AND event5 does not happen"") is false.

Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event5 happened (current state = event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (from the context, with duplicates removed)
- After event1 → next must be one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → next must be one of {event1, event3, event5}.
- After event3 → next must be event2.
- After event4 → next must be one of {event1, event3}.
- After event5 → next must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.

(Notes: the context repeats some rules, but these are the distinct constraints.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens."" This is just the same as ""Event3 happens"" (a redundant tautology).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Equivalently, C2 asserts that in the next state event3 happens.

Step 4 — how they relate and whether C2 is true
- We start in a state where event5 happened.
- The rule for event5 requires the next event to be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- C2 requires that the next event is event3.
- The rules allow event3 as a possible next event, but they also allow event1 or event4. Because the transition is nondeterministic among those allowed choices, event3 is not forced — it is possible but not guaranteed.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed (not logically entailed) by the given information. So, if the question is whether C2 must be true in all allowed executions, the answer is False.
- (If you instead ask whether C2 can be true in some execution, the answer is True — choose event3 as the next event.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Starting from event5 the next event may be one of {event1, event3, event4}. C2 asserts the next event is event3; that is possible but not forced by the rules, so it is not guaranteed (not entailed)."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (this is the current state).

2) Transition rules (from the context)
- After event1: either event2, event3, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event2: either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event3: either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event4: either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event5: either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
(Several rules are repeated in the text; they state the same constraints.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens."" This asserts that both event2 and event3 occur (in the same state unless otherwise qualified).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" From the initial state (event1), C2 says that in the immediately following state both event2 and event3 occur.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial state (event1), the transition rule for event1 requires that the next state is one of event2, event3, event4, or event5.
- The phrasing ""either event2, event3, event4, or event5 must happen"" means the next state is one of those events (not that multiple of them happen simultaneously). Therefore the next state can be event2 OR event3 (or 4 or 5), but not both event2 and event3 together.
- Because C2 requires both event2 and event3 to hold in that single next state, and the transition allows only one of them, C2 is false.

(If you instead intended ""either"" to be inclusive or to allow multiple events in a single state, the specification is ambiguous; under that different interpretation C2 could be possible only if the model explicitly allows multiple simultaneous events. But under the standard reading above, C2 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False. From event1 the next state can be one of {event2, event3, event4, event5} but not both event2 and event3 simultaneously, so C1 cannot hold in the next state."

Summary answer: C2 is not guaranteed (not necessarily true). It is possible (true) in some successor choices and false in others, so it is undetermined / not entailed by the premises.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event3 happened initially (we consider the ""next state"" after that initial event3).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- After event1 the next event must be one of {event2, event3}.
- After event2 the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- After event5 no further events can happen (event5 is terminal).
(Repeated lines in the context do not change these rules.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state"" — i.e., the immediate successor of the initial event3 is event5.
- C2: ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e., the immediate successor is event4 OR event5.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the transition rule after event3, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- C2 requires the next event to be in {event4, event5}. That is a strict subset of the allowed successors; the next event could also be event1 or event2, in which case C2 would be false.

Concrete examples:
- If the next state after event3 is event5: then C1 is true, so C2 (event4 or C1) is true.
- If the next state after event3 is event4: C1 is false but event4 is true, so C2 is true.
- If the next state after event3 is event1 (or event2): C1 is false and event4 is false, so C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is not logically entailed by the premises. It is possible (true) in some allowed successors (event4 or event5) and false in others (event1 or event2). Therefore we cannot conclude C2 is true; its truth is undetermined from the given information.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules (from the text)
- After event3, the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- After event2, the next event must be either event1, event3, or event5.
- After event4, the next event must be event5.
- After event1, the next event must be event5.
- After event5, the next event must be either event1 or event4.
(The repetition of the event5 rule does not change anything.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" Interpreting commonly used meanings:
  - If read as ""event4 occurs in every state"" (G event4), this is immediately false because the initial state is event2, not event4.
  - If read as ""event4 inevitably occurs at some future time on every possible execution path"" (i.e., on all continuations from now, event4 will eventually occur), we can test that too; it will also be false (see counterexample below).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether, in the state immediately after the initial one (i.e., after one transition from the initial event2), C1 is true from that point onward.

4) How the conditions relate and final check
- Produce a reachable infinite execution that never contains event4:
  - Start: event2 (given).
  - From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
  - From event1 the next must be event5.
  - From event5 choose event1 (allowed).
  - Repeat event1 → event5 → event1 → event5 → ... forever.
  - This infinite run never contains event4.

Because such a run is reachable from the initial state, C1 (that event4 must always happen / eventually happens on all paths) is false. Since C1 is false at the initial state, it cannot become true simply ""in the next state"" in the universal sense C2 asserts (i.e., that C1 holds from every possible next state). So C2 is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: event2 → event1 → event5 → event1 → event5 → ... never contains event4, so C1 is false; in particular C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event5 has happened (the system starts in a state after event5).

Step 2 — transition rules (deduplicated)
- After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event3 must happen.

(Notes: the context repeated some rules; I listed each unique rule once.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event4 happens."" This means both event1 and event4 occur (at some point in the execution, or depending on intended semantics, in the current state).  
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This is ambiguous unless you fix a temporal meaning:
  - If “always” means globally (G) — i.e. at every moment/state C1 is true — then C2 would require that at every state both event1 and event4 hold simultaneously.
  - If “always” means inevitability (in all possible runs/event sequences, C1 will occur at some time), then C2 requires that in every possible execution both event1 and event4 eventually occur.

Step 4 — do the conditions hold? (conclusion)
- Under either natural reading, C2 is False.
  - If “always” = globally: the initial state (after event5) does not have event1 and event4, so C1 does not hold at that moment; therefore C2 is false.
  - If “always” = “inevitably in every run”: we can produce a counterexample run that never includes event4, so C1 does not hold in that run. Example trace:
    - Choose after event5: event3 (so 5 → 3).
    - After event3 choose event1 (3 → 1).
    - After event1 choose event3 (1 → 3).
    - Repeat 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 … forever.
    This infinite execution contains event1 repeatedly but never contains event4, so the conjunction “event1 and event4” never becomes true. Thus C1 does not hold in every possible run, so C2 is false.

Therefore: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 has happened (this is given as the starting point).

Step 2 — transition rules (condensed)
- After event4: either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event3: either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event2: either event1, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event1: event3 must happen.
- After event5: event3 must happen.

(Notes: some statements in the problem repeated the same rules; the above is the unique set of constraints.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens or event5 happens.” Interpreted as: at some point (after the start) either event3 or event5 occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens.” That is, (event3 or event5 occurs) AND (event1 occurs at some point).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- From the initial event4 and the rule “after event4: either event3 or event5 must happen,” C1 is necessarily true (event3 or event5 will occur). So C1 is true/entailed.
- Event1, however, is not forced by the rules. There are valid event sequences where event1 does occur and valid sequences where it never occurs. Therefore C2 (which requires event1 to occur) is not guaranteed by the rules.

Examples:
- A sequence where C2 is true: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 … (here event1 does occur).
- A sequence where C2 is false: 4 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 … (you can loop between 3 and 2 forever and never take the branch to event1), or 4 → 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 … (never hitting event1).

Conclusion
- C1: True (entailed by the initial condition and rules).
- C2: Not necessarily true (not entailed). So as a logical consequence of the given rules, C2 is false — it can be true in some runs but is not guaranteed.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From event4 we must have event3 or event5, so C1 holds. But event1 is not forced by the rules — there are valid infinite runs (e.g., 4 → 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 … or 4 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 …) that never reach event1. Hence C2 (C1 and event1) is not guaranteed."

Summary answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts in state ""event1"").

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event5 → event4 must happen next. (5 → 4)
- After event4 → event5 must happen next. (4 → 5)
  => Events 4 and 5 force each other and form an infinite 4↔5 loop if entered.
- After event1 → either event2, event4, or event5 must happen next. (1 → {2,4,5})
- After event2 → either event1, event4, or event5 must happen next. (2 → {1,4,5})
- After event3 → either event1, event2, or event4 must happen next. (3 → {1,2,4})

Note: No rule gives any event → event3. That is, there are no incoming transitions to event3 from any listed event.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" — in temporal logic: F(event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — F(C1) = F(F(event3)). (In linear temporal logic F is idempotent, so F(F p) ≡ F p.)

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Because the system starts at event1 and no transition leads into event3, event3 is unreachable from the initial state. Therefore event3 never happens on any possible execution starting from event1.
- So C1 (event3 eventually happens) is false.
- Consequently C2 (eventually C1) is also false (and, equivalently, false for the same reason as C1).

Therefore C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: in the current state, event4 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (interpretation: “After X, Y must happen” means in the next state after X occurs)
- If event5 occurs then the next state must be event4.
- If event4 occurs then the next state must be event1.
- If event1 occurs then the next state must be either event2 or event5.
- If event2 occurs then the next state must be either event3, event4, or event5.
- If event3 occurs then the next state must be either event1 or event4.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens.” (This requires both event1 and event2 to hold in the same state.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” (So both event1 and event2 must be true in the immediate next state after the current one.)

Step 4 — relate them and decide C2
- Current state: event4. By the rule “After event4, event1 must happen,” the immediate next state must be event1.
- In that next state event1 holds, but event2 does not hold in the same state (event2 could only hold in the subsequent state if the choice after event1 is event2).
- Therefore C1 (both event1 and event2 in the same state) is false in the next state, so C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event2 happened.

(Implicit assumption used below: events are atomic per state — one event happens in each state — because the rules use “either” / “must happen” to pick the next event. The conclusion is the same under any reasonable reading.)

2) Transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event3 → next state must be event1 or event2 or event4.
- After event1 → next state must be event3 or event5.
- After event2 → next state must be event4 or event5.
- After event4 → next state must be event3.
- After event5 → next state must be event1 or event2 or event3 or event4.

(Notes: the rule “After event4, event3 must happen” appears twice in the problem but is the same rule; likewise the rule for event5 is repeated.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event3 happens and event4 happens.” Interpreted as: in some state both event3 and event4 hold (or both occur simultaneously).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That is, in the state immediately following the initial state S0, both event3 and event4 should hold.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From S0 (event2), the transition rule for event2 requires the next state S1 be either event4 or event5.
  - If S1 = event4, then event4 holds in S1 but event3 does not (event3 is required after event4 but that happens in the following state S2). So C1 is false in S1.
  - If S1 = event5, then S1 is event5, so neither (event3 and event4) both hold in S1; C1 is false in S1.
- In every possible next state S1, C1 does not hold. Therefore C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the initial state S0 (event2), the next state S1 must be event4 or event5. In S1 = event4, event3 occurs only in the following state; in S1 = event5 neither event3 nor event4 both hold. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3, event4, event5.
- Initial condition: event4 happened (start with event4).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event2 → event3 must happen (i.e., event2 implies eventual event3).
- After event3 → one of event1, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event1 → no further events (event1 is terminal).
- After event4 → one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- After event5 → event1 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" (a global claim that in the run/event sequence event3 occurs at some point).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not eventually happen).

4) How they relate — analysis
- From the initial event4, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
  - If the next event is event3, then C1 holds.
  - If the next event is event2, rule forces event3 afterward, so C1 holds.
  - If the next event is event1, event1 is terminal and no further events occur, so event3 never happens in that trace and C1 fails.
- Thus there exist executions where event3 does happen (paths starting event4→event2→event3 or event4→event3, etc.) and there exist executions where it does not (event4→event1).

Conclusion about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold universally. That claim is false because there are valid executions where C1 does hold. (Equivalently: C1 is satisfiable but not guaranteed/valid; C2 is not true as a global property. Note C2 does hold on some particular traces, but as a general claim about the system it is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Answer: True.

Reason: If C1 is taken as the global property ""event3 eventually happens in every execution from the initial state"", then C1 is false (there is the execution event4 → event1, and event1 is terminal so event3 never occurs). Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. (If instead C1 were intended as an existential claim ""there exists an execution where event3 happens"", then C1 would be true and C2 false; the usual reading for these system properties is the universal one.)"
