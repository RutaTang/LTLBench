Reasoning:
- Initially event3 occurred, so C1 (event1 or event3 happens) already holds at the start.
- Even if you consider ""eventually"" as meaning at some future step: after event3 the next event must be either event1 or event2.
  - If the next is event1, C1 holds.
  - If the next is event2, then after event2 the next event must be either event1 or event3, so C1 will hold then.

- After event4 → either event1 or event3.

- After event2 → either event1 or event4.

5. After event2 choose event1, then event4, then event1, … and so on, always choosing transitions that avoid event5.

Examine the rules (as transitions after an event):
- After 1 → 5 (so 5 happens next).
- After 2 → 3.
- After 3 → 1 or 5. Either choice leads to 5 next or via 1 to 5.
- After 4 → 1 or 2 or 3. Each of those (1, 2, 3) leads to 5 eventually: 1 → 5; 2 → 3 → (1 or 5) → 5; 3 → (1 or 5) → 5.
- After 5 → 1 or 4. From 1 we get 5 immediately; from 4 we get to {1,2,3} and therefore to 5 as just shown.

Thus from every event (1,2,3,4,5) any allowed future sequence must lead to event5 in finitely many steps. Since the system starts with event5 and from every reachable state event5 is inevitable, C1 holds at all times. Therefore C2 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event4 occurs.
- From event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- If we choose the sequence 4 → 3, then from 3 the next must be one of {2,4,5}. Choose 3 → 2, and from 2 we are forced to go to 4 (2 → 4).
- So we have the cycle 4 → 3 → 2 → 4 which can repeat indefinitely, producing infinite occurrences of event3.

- C1: event4 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens, event4 does not happen).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, no other events can happen. (So any occurrence of event5 is terminal.)
- The other ""after"" rules only apply if their antecedent event can occur; but because event5 has already happened and is terminal, no further events can occur.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Because event5 happens initially and is terminal, the only possible sequence is: event5 and then stop.
- Therefore events 1–4 never happen in any allowed sequence. In particular, event1 never happens and event4 never happens. So C1 (event4 does not happen) holds.
- C2 is an implication ""if event1 happens then event4 does not happen."" Since event1 never happens in any allowed sequence, the antecedent is always false; the implication is vacuously true. (Even more directly: event4 does not happen, so the implication holds.)

Step 2 — reason about C1 (""If event2 happens, then event5 happens"")
- In any run starting from the given initial condition, event5 has already occurred (initially).

- The context states: ""Initially, event3 happened.""
- Also: ""After event3, no other events can happen.""

Reasoning through sequences:
- Because event3 has already happened in the initial state, C1 is satisfied immediately (event3 has occurred).
- That initial fact holds in every possible execution (every execution starts with event3 having happened), so there is no execution where event3 fails to have happened.
- The other rules (about events 1,2,4,5) are irrelevant because no events can occur after event3.

Therefore C1 holds in all executions, so C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context we have the allowed transitions:
  - 5 -> {1, 3}
  - 3 -> {1, 2, 5}
  - 1 -> {2, 3, 5}
  - 2 -> {3, 5}
  - 4 -> {1, 2}
- Initially event5 happens.

To show C2 (""event2 happens OR (if event3 happens then event5 happens)"") is false, we need a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which event2 never happens and C1 (3 -> 5) is false.

Construct this sequence:
- Start with 5 (given).
- From 5 choose 3 (allowed).
- From 3 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 3 (allowed).
- Repeat 3,1,3,1,... forever.

This sequence:
- Never includes event2, so the left disjunct ""event2 happens"" is false.
- Contains occurrences of event3 that are followed by event1 (not event5), so the implication ""if event3 happens then event5 happens"" (C1) is false.

Therefore the disjunction C2 is not necessarily true given the rules, so C2 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" (redundant — equivalent to ""Event2 happens""). C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. eventually Event2 happens.

- From the context, Event2 has already happened initially. So C1 holds immediately, hence C2 (""eventually C1"") is satisfied now.

- (If one interprets ""eventually"" as requiring a future occurrence strictly after the initial moment, the system still forces Event2 to recur: after Event2 either Event1 or Event5 must occur. If Event5 occurs then Event4 must occur and then Event2 must occur. If Event1 occurs then either Event4 or Event5 must occur; both routes lead to Event4 and then to Event2.

- C1: ""Event4 happens or event4 happens"" is equivalent to just ""Event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore ""Event4 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the rules and the initial state
- Initially event5 happened.
- Allowed next events:
  - After event5 → {event1, event2, event3}
  - After event1 → {event2, event3}
  - After event2 → {event1}
  - After event3 → {event1, event2}
  - After event4 → {event1, event3, event5}
- Note: No rule allows any event to be followed by event4. Event4 is not reachable from the initial event5 (nor from any subsequent allowed events).

- Event4 can never occur given the initial event5 and the transition rules, so ""Event4 happens"" (C1) is false.

- After event5, no other events can happen. (So the sequence terminates at the initial event5.)
- The other rules (what must follow event1, event2, event3, event4) are irrelevant if no further events occur after the initial event5.

Step 3 — trace possible events
- Because event5 happened initially and it forbids any further events, there is no place in the timeline where event3 can occur.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is true in the initial state and remains true thereafter.

- In the next state there are still no events (since event5 prevents any further events), so event3 does not happen in the next state.

- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: event3 happens.
- From 3 the rules allow either 1 or 4. From 1 the rules allow 3 (or 4 or 5). From 4 the rule forces 3. Thus there is a valid infinite trace 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, ... (3→1→3 cycle).

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):
- Hypothesis C2 says: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"", where C1 is ""event1 happens and event5 happens"".
- From the context, event5 happens initially, so the ""event5 happens"" part of C1 is already true in every sequence.
- The only remaining requirement for C1 is that event1 must occur sometime.
- But the transition rules allow a cycle that includes event3 while avoiding event1: e.g.
  event5 (initial) -> event4 -> event3 -> event5 -> event4 -> event3 -> ... 
  At each choice the allowed successor is chosen so event1 never happens.

- C2 states: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 states: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
So C2 asserts: whenever event3 occurs, the very next state must be event4.

Step 2 — Examine the rules:
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event1 or event4 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event5 must happen.

Step 3 — Find a counterexample trace:
From the initial event2 we must have event3 next (by ""after event2, event3 must happen""). So one possible sequence is:
- state1: event2 (initial)
- state2: event3 (forced)
From event3, the rules allow event2 to happen next (""after event3, either event2 or event5 must happen""). So choose event2:
- state3: event2
Thus after event3 the next state is event2, not event4. This shows that event3 does not force event4 in the next state.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually it will be the case that Event5 eventually happens). Note: in temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is effectively the same as C1.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event5 must happen. (No choice; event5 follows.)
- The other rules describe what can follow after other events, but they do not prevent event5 from occurring after the initial event1.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- At the start event1 has occurred.
- By the rule ""after event1, event5 must happen"", event5 occurs next. Therefore event5 does eventually happen (C1 is true).

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Goal: C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"", where C1 is ""If event4 happens, then event1 happens.""
- From the context: Initially event3 happens. After event3, the next event must be either event2 or event5.
- Take the next-state choice event2. From event2 we may have event4 (rule: after event2, either event3 or event4 must happen).
- If event4 happens, the rules require event2 to follow (after event4, event2 must happen). Nothing forces event1 to happen after event4.
- So there is a valid run where, starting from the next state (event2), event4 occurs but event1 never occurs. That shows C1 does not hold in that next state.

- From the rules: 3 -> {1,4,5}; 4 -> {1,2,3}; 1 -> {3,5}; 5 -> {3}; 2 -> {3}. Initial event is 3.

- Counterexample run: start at 3, choose 4 (allowed). From 4 choose 1 (allowed). From 1 choose 5 (allowed). From 5 must go to 3. Now repeat: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> ... This infinite cycle contains event4 but never contains event2. Thus event2 is not guaranteed to occur even when event4 happens, so C1 is false in that case.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2 has happened.
- From event2 you can go to either event3 or event5.
  - If you choose event5, the run terminates (no further events). In that run event4 never occurs, so C1 holds and hence C2 holds on that run.
  - If you choose event3, from event3 you can choose event4 (or event5). If you choose event4, from event4 you can go to event2 or event1; choosing event2 can lead back to event3, then event4 again, and so on.
- Therefore there exists a nonterminating run: event2 → event3 → event4 → event2 → event3 → event4 → ... in which event4 occurs infinitely often and you never reach a point after which “event4 does not happen.”
- C2 asserts that eventually C1 holds (i.e., from some point onward event4 never happens). Because there is a valid run where event4 keeps happening forever, C2 is not guaranteed.

Step 2 — examine the system and C1
- Initially event4 happens, so C1 is already false (at time 0 the event is event4, not event1).

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2
- A valid sequence: event4 (initial) → event1 (allowed after event4) → event2 (allowed after event1).
- In this sequence, event1 does happen (antecedent of C2 is true) but C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false (we have times with event4 and event2).

- C1: ""Event5 does not happen"" (i.e., event5 never occurs in any execution).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all reachable executions from the given start, event5 never occurs.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (successors)
From the description the allowed immediate successors are:
- After event3 → {event1, event2, event4}
- After event1 → {event2, event3, event4}
- After event2 → {event3, event4}
- After event4 → {event1, event3}
(There is also a rule ""After event5 → {event1, event3, event4}"", but that only matters if event5 could occur.)

Step 3 — reachability from the initial event
- The system starts with event3.
- From event3 the only possible next events are 1, 2, or 4.
- From those, the sets of possible next events are as listed above. None of these successor sets ever includes event5.
- Therefore no sequence starting from the initial event3 can produce event5; event5 is unreachable.

Because event5 cannot occur in any reachable execution from the given start, ""Event5 does not happen"" always holds. So C2 is True."

- Initially, event4 happened. So event4 has already occurred at the start of every possible execution.
- After event4, next event ∈ {event1, event3}.
- After event3, next ∈ {event1, event2, event5}.
- After event1, next must be event4.
- After event2, next ∈ {event1, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event5, no other events can happen (event5 is terminal).

Step 3 — reasoning about C2
- C2 is an implication: if event5 eventually happens, then event4 happens.
- But event4 has already happened initially in every execution. So in any execution where event5 eventually happens, event4 is guaranteed to have occurred (at the very start).
- Therefore the implication C1 → (event4 happens) is true (it holds in all possible executions).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: 5 -> {2,4}; 4 -> {2,3}; 3 -> {1,2,4}; 1 -> {2,3}.
- Start: event5 happened. Choose 5 -> 4, so event4 happens (so C1 holds).
- From 4, choose 4 -> 3 (avoiding 2). From 3, choose 3 -> 1 (avoiding 2). From 1, choose 1 -> 3 (avoiding 2).
- Now we can cycle 3 <-> 1 forever, never taking any transition to event2.
- This produces a valid sequence in which C1 holds (event4 and event1 occur) but event2 never happens.

- Initially event3 happened.

- After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards).
- After event5, event2 must happen (so if event5 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (this only stops further events after event2).
- After event4, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen (irrelevant here because event4 is not forced).

Step 3 — trace the possible next-state outcomes
From the initial state (event3), the next event must be one of: event1, event2, or event5.
- If the next event is event2, then event2 has occurred already — C1 holds in that next state.
- If the next event is event1, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" ensures event2 will occur later — so C1 holds in that next state.
- If the next event is event5, the rule ""after event5, event2 must happen"" ensures event2 will occur later — so C1 holds in that next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From event5, the rules allow next = event3 or event4.
- If event5 -> event4, then event4 -> event3 (forced).
- From event3 you may choose event4 (one of the allowed options), not necessarily event2.
- Thus there exists a valid continuation starting from event5 that never yields event2 (e.g., event5 -> event4 -> event3 -> event4 -> ...).
- Therefore the statement ""If event5 happens in the next state, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules, so C2 is False."

  - If event1 is chosen, from event1 the next event must be one of {event3, event4}.

    - If event4 occurs, from event4 the next event must be event3, so event3 occurs and C1 holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis: C2 says ""event3 does not happen eventually"" (i.e. from some point onward event3 never occurs).
- Transitions (from the context):
  1 -> {2,4,5}
  2 -> {3,5}
  3 -> {1,4,5}
  4 -> {1,3}
  5 -> {1,2}
  initial state: event1 occurred.

- You can avoid event3 forever: choose 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... (or 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> ...). These infinite traces never include event3, so C1 already holds and thus C2 holds on those traces.

- But C2 is not guaranteed: you can also produce a trace where event3 happens repeatedly, e.g. 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... (1->2, 2->3, 3->1 is a cycle). On this trace event3 never stops occurring, so C1 never becomes true and C2 fails.

Because there exist valid executions where C2 is false, C2 is not entailed by the scenario. Hence the correct answer is False."

Reasoning:
- Let S0 be the initial state where event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur in the next state S1. So C1 (event4 happens in the next state) is true at S0.
- The rule ""After event4, no other events can happen"" makes S1 terminal: there is no state after S1.
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in S1 it should be true that event4 happens in S1's next state). But S1 has no next state, so ""event4 happens in the next state"" is false at S1.
Therefore C2 is False."

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1 says: at some point (eventually) event1 occurs.
- C2 says: if event1 occurs, then event1 eventually occurs.
- If event1 occurs at some time in a run, then by that occurrence there exists a time at which event1 occurs — so ""eventually event1"" is satisfied in that run.
- If event1 never occurs, the antecedent of C2 is false and the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C2 is always true (either because the occurrence implies eventual occurrence, or because the implication is vacuously true).

Reasoning: From the initial event5 you can avoid event2 forever by choosing 1 after 5 and then looping 1→3→5→1… (after 5 pick 1, after 1 pick 3, after 3 pick 5, repeat). So C1 (event2 does not happen) can hold on some runs.

But C2 says that eventually C1 holds in all runs (i.e., after some point event2 never occurs). That is not guaranteed: there is a valid run where event2 recurs indefinitely, e.g. 5 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 5 → … which respects all given ""after"" rules and contains event2 infinitely often.

We must decide whether C2 is true given the initial conditions and transition rules.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and immediate successor(s)
- Initially event2 happened.
- From event2, the rules say the next event must be either event3 or event5 (no other option).
- Therefore the immediate next state after the initial state is either ""event3 happened"" or ""event5 happened"".

Step 3 — check whether event1 happens in those next states
- In the next state being event3, event1 does not happen in that (immediate) next state — event1 would only occur later (event3 → event4 → event1).
- In the next state being event5, event1 does not happen there either; event5 is terminal (no further events).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The hypothesis C1 is: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens.""  
- We are told initially event4 happened. The transition rule for event4 is: after event4, either event1 or event2 must happen. There is no rule that forces event5 immediately after event4.
- A concrete counterexample: take the next event to be event1 (allowed by the rule after event4). Then event5 did not follow event4, so C1 is false in the current state. Since the same permitted transition (event4 → event1) also determines the next state, C1 does not hold in the next state either.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

- No rule produces event4 or event5 from any of events 1, 2, or 3.

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 says: event2 or event4 happens.
- C2 says: C1 does not hold (neither event2 nor event4 happens).
- From the rules, after event1 (which initially happened) one of {event2, event4, event5} must happen. So it's possible to pick event5 repeatedly: 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ... (after 5 we must return to 1, after 1 we may choose 5 again). That run never involves event2 or event4, so C2 can be true in some runs.
- But it's also possible after the initial event1 to choose event2 or event4, so C1 can be true in other runs.

Because C2 is not guaranteed by the premises (it can be true in some sequences and false in others), we cannot assert C2 as True. Hence the correct answer is False."

- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds (event4 happens and event2 happens), then event3 happens.""
- We must decide whether that implication is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Step 2 — relevant conditions
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen. (unconditional)
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- Other rules (about event1, event2, event5) are optional branches and do not prevent the after-event requirements above.

Step 3 — reasoning
- Because event4 happens (it is given initially, and C1 also includes event4), the rule ""after event4, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur at some point after that event4.
- The presence of event2 in C1 does not block or negate the unconditional requirement that event3 must occur after event4. No rule allows skipping the mandatory ""after event4 → event3"" requirement.
- Therefore whenever C1 holds (i.e., event4 is among the events), event3 necessarily happens.

Reasoning:
- Initial event3 happens.
- After event3 either event1 or event5 must happen. So both are possible.
- If we choose event3 -> event5, then C1 (event3 and event5 happen) is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") would be false in that execution.

- Therefore event3 never happens, so C1 is false in this scenario.
- C2 is the implication ""if event3 happens then event3 eventually happens."" Since event3 does not happen, the antecedent is never true, so the implication is vacuously true. (Also, if event3 did happen at some point, then ""event3 eventually happens"" would be true because it has occurred.)

Interpretation:
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens."" (i.e. whenever 4 occurs it is followed by 5)
- C2: C1 is true in the next state (starting from the initial situation).

Given transition rules (deduplicated):
- Initially: event3 happened.
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5}
- 2 -> {3,5}
- 3 -> {1,2}
- 4 -> {3,5}
- 5 -> {2}

Reasoning and counterexample:
- From the initial event3, the next event can be event1 (3 -> 1 is allowed).
- From event1, event4 can occur next (1 -> 4 is allowed).
- From event4, event3 can occur next (4 -> 3 is allowed).
- Thus there is a valid execution 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 in which event4 occurs and is followed by event3, not event5.

This shows C1 is not guaranteed (4 can be followed by 3 instead of 5). Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state. So C2 is False.

C1 states: ""Event4 happens and event1 happens."" That is, C1 explicitly asserts event4.

A statement ""A and B"" logically entails A. Therefore if C1 holds (i.e., event4 and event1 both hold), then event4 holds. Even if the overall event rules made C1 impossible, the conditional ""if C1 then event4"" would still be true (vacuously or by direct entailment).

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happened. From event3 the next event can be event2 or event4.
- C1 says: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" — i.e. after an occurrence of event1, event2 must occur.
- From the transition rules, after event1 the allowed next events are {event3, event4}, so event2 is not guaranteed after event1.
- Concretely: one possible trace is event3 → event2 → event1 → event3. Here event1 occurs but is followed by event3 (not event2), so C1 is false in that state.
- Since in both possible next states (after event3 → event2 or event3 → event4) C1 can be violated, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False."

- C1 is the formula ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens"" (i.e. event5 → event5).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some point in the execution where C1 is true).

Step 2 — logical nature of C1
- The implication A → A is a tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether A (event5) actually occurs. If event5 occurs, the consequent is the same and true; if event5 does not occur, the implication is true because a false antecedent makes the implication true. So C1 is true in every state.

Step 3 — consequence for C2
- Since C1 is true immediately (and hence at some point in the execution), C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied.

Reasoning:
- From the rules: 2 -> {3,4,5}; 3 -> {4,5}; 4 -> {3,5}; 5 -> {1,3,4}; 1 -> {2,4,5}.
- Starting at event2, one possible trace is 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... (looping indefinitely between 3 and 5).
- That trace never visits event1 or event4, so C1 (""event4 or event1 happens"") is not guaranteed by the context.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., neither 1 nor 4 ever happens). The context does not force C2 either, because other valid traces can include 1 or 4.

- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, no other events can happen.
(Other rules about what can happen after events 1, 3, or 4 are irrelevant unless those events occur.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event2 (given).
- By rule, after event2 event5 must happen → sequence goes to event5.
- After event5 no other events can happen → sequence ends at event5.
- Event1 never occurs in this sequence, and there is no alternative branch because the rules force 2 → 5 → end.

- From event1 we may choose event4 (allowed by ""after event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen"").
- From event4 we must go to event3. From event3 we can choose event5 (allowed by ""after event3, either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen"").
- From event5 we must go to event4, then to event3, then back to event5, etc. This yields an infinite loop 4 → 3 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 5 ... with no event1.

Step 2 — Understand the context constraints
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 occurs.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs (and it does initially), no other events occur afterward.
- Other rules (about event2, event3, event5, event4) do not force event4 to have happened before event1; and since event1 is initial, event4 did not occur earlier.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after it, event4 does not occur in this scenario.
- Thus we have a counterexample to C1: event1 happens but event4 does not.

Key rules (from the context)
- Initially: event2 happens.
- After event2 → event3 must happen next.
- After event3 → either event2 or event5 happens next.
- After event5 → either event1 or event2 happens next.
- After event1 → either event4 or event5 happens next.

We need a counterexample run in which (a) Event1 never happens, and (b) Event3 does not always hold. Consider this infinite run:

2. t1: event3 (required after event2).
3. t2: choose event2 (allowed after event3).
4. t3: event3 (required after that event2).
5. t4: choose event2 again...
Repeat steps 2–4 forever: ... → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ...

- From event5 the next event must be event1.

Step 3 — exhibit a valid infinite trace that avoids event2
- Choose the following transitions consistently: 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> ...
- Each step respects the rules: after 3 choose 5; after 5 go to 1; after 1 choose 3.
- This infinite trace never contains event2, so event2 does not eventually happen on this trace.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- We start with event5 (given).
- From event5, event3 must happen.
- From event3, we may choose either event2 or event5.

Construct a valid infinite trace that avoids event2: after the initial event5 -> event3, always choose event5 (from event3 take the branch back to event5). That yields the infinite sequence: 5, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, ... This sequence respects all rules (after each 5 follows 3; after each 3 we chose 5), and never contains event2.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 occurs. By the rule ""After event5, event4 must happen"", event4 must occur next.
- From event4, one of {event2, event3, event5} must occur. If we always choose event3, then from event3 we may choose event4 (since 3 -> {1,4,5}), returning to event4.
- That gives a valid infinite trace: 5 (initial), 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, ... in which event1 never occurs.
- C1 requires both event1 and event5 to happen. Although event5 did happen initially, event1 does not occur in the trace above, so C1 does not hold in that execution.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, the transitions are:
  - 1 -> {2,4}
  - 2 -> {1,3,4,5}
  - 3 -> {1,2,4,5}
  - 4 -> {1,2,3}
  - 5 -> {3,4}
  - initial event is 1.
- To show C2 (“event5 happens and event3 eventually happens”) is true would require that in every possible continuation from the initial state both event5 and event3 occur eventually.
- But there is a valid infinite continuation that avoids both event3 and event5: 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → … (from 1 choose 4; from 4 choose 1; both choices are allowed). This path never visits 3 or 5.
- Therefore C1 (event3 eventually happens) is not guaranteed, and hence C2 is not guaranteed.

So C2 is False."

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., event1 does happen.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the event rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event5 must happen.
(Other rules about event4 are irrelevant here because event4 never appears in the initial trace.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: event5 → event3.
- From event3 we can choose event2 (the rules allow either event1 or event2).
- From event2 we can choose event5 (the rules allow either event1 or event5).
- That returns us to event5 → event3, so we can repeat the cycle event5 → event3 → event2 → event5 indefinitely, never taking the alternative that produces event1.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid infinite trace that never produces event1, event1 is not forced to occur. C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") can be true in some allowed executions, so C1 does not necessarily fail.

- After event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Other rules allow various continuations but don’t forbid choosing event2 from event1.

- No rule produces event3 at any point, so event3 cannot occur in any sequence starting from the given initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Start: event4 has happened. Next must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5}.
2. C1 says: if event5 happens, then event1 happens. This does not force event5 to happen; it only constrains sequences that include event5 (they must also include event1).
3. Consider the sequence event4 -> event1. This sequence is allowed by the context and satisfies C1 (no event5 occurs, so the implication holds vacuously).
4. In that sequence, event2 does not happen. Therefore, C1 can hold while event2 does not occur.
5. C2 asserts “if C1 holds, then event2 happens” — this is falsified by the counterexample in step 3.

Thus C2 is False."

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (reachability):
- Initially event3 has happened.
- From event3 the next event must be either event2 or event5.
- From event2 the next event must be event1, event3, or event5.
- From event1 the next event must be event2.
- From event5 no other events can happen (terminal).
- From event4 the next event would be event3 or event5 — but crucially there is no rule that allows any event to lead to event4.

Step 3 — reason about whether event4 can ever occur:
- Since the only events that can occur starting from the initial event3 are those reachable via the given transitions (3 → {2,5}, 2 → {1,3,5}, 1 → {2}, and 5 terminal), the set of reachable events is {1,2,3,5}.
- There is no transition that produces event4, so event4 is unreachable and can never occur in any execution consistent with the context.

2. The rules state: after event5, event2 must happen. Since event5 did occur initially, event2 must occur.
3. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false in this scenario.
4. C2 claims C1 always holds; because we have a required occurrence of event2, C1 does not hold, so C2 is false.

Reasoning:

- After event1 the system may choose event5 again. So one possible infinite trace is 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ... .
- In that trace event4 never occurs (even though event5 does), so the conjunction ""event4 happens and event5 happens"" need not ever become true.

The rules are nondeterministic choices (after X, one of the listed events must happen). To show C2 is true would require that every valid sequence starting from the initial event5 contains both event4 and event1. To show C2 is false it suffices to give one valid sequence that obeys all rules but does not have both event4 and event1.

Counterexample sequence:
- Start: event5 (given).
- After event5 choose event2 (allowed).
- After event2 choose event5 (allowed).

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpret the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — from the initial state (where event3 happened), this asserts event1 occurs at state1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — from the initial state, this asserts that in state1, C1 is true; equivalently, event1 must occur at state2.

2. Use the given transitions from the initial state (state0 where event3 occurred):
- From event3, state1 ∈ {event2, event4, event5}.

3. Examine each possibility:
- If state1 = event4, then by ""after event4, event1 must happen"", event1 occurs at state2 — this branch makes C2 true.
- If state1 = event2, then state2 ∈ {event4, event5}. Neither forces event1 at state2 (event1 would be forced only after an event4 at state2 to the next state). So in this branch event1 need not occur at state2 — C2 can be false.
- If state1 = event5, then state2 ∈ {event3, event4}. In the subcase state2 = event3, event1 does not occur at state2. In the subcase state2 = event4, event1 would occur at state3, not at state2. So these branches do not force event1 at state2.

4. Because there exist valid sequences consistent with the rules where event1 does not occur at state2, C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed) by the context.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event5 happens. By the rule ""After event5, event1 must happen"", event1 occurs next, so C1 holds at that moment.
- But ""C2: C1 always holds"" means C1 must be true at every step on every possible continuation.
- After event1, one allowed next event is event2. From event2 one allowed next event is event4. From event4 one allowed next event is event2. Thus there is a reachable cycle 2 → 4 → 2 → ... that never contains event1.
- In those states where event2 or event4 happened, C1 (which asserts event1) is false. Therefore C1 does not hold at all times on all runs.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 occurs.
- From event2 we may choose event4 (rule: after event2 → either event3 or event4).
- After event4 must come event5.
- After event5 we may choose event2 (rule: after event5 → either event2 or event3).
- That yields the infinite loop 2 → 4 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 5 → … which obeys all rules and never includes event3.

Thus, ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed (there is a valid run with no event3), so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is False."

Examine the rules (transitions):
- 4 -> {2, 3, 5}
- 5 -> {1, 2}
- 1 -> {2, 3}
- 2 -> {1, 3}
- 3 -> {1, 2}

Start: event4 happened.

We ask: from 4, must every possible future sequence eventually hit event3? If there exists any valid infinite path that avoids event3, then C1 does not hold (so C2 is true).

Construct such a path avoiding event3:
- From 4 choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2 choose 1 (allowed; 2 -> 1 or 3).
- From 1 choose 2 (allowed; 1 -> 2 or 3).
- Repeat 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 ... forever.

All steps follow the given ""must"" choices, and event3 never occurs on this infinite path. Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So the current (initial) event is event2.
- The ""After eventX, either ..."" rules give the allowed next events from each event.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted as a global/temporal ""always"" property: at every future step the event must be event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning: from the next state onward, it is true that event1 always happens.

Step 2 — list the transition rules
- 2 -> {1, 3}
- 1 -> {2, 3, 4}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 5}
- 4 -> {1, 2}
- 5 -> {1, 3}

Step 3 — check possibility of ""event1 always happens""
- For event1 to always hold from some state onward, every next event after that state must be event1.
- But from event1 the allowed next events are {2,3,4} — none of which is event1. So once you are in a state where event1 has just happened, the next step cannot be event1. Hence you cannot have event1 at every future step (it is impossible to get two consecutive event1s).
- Therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false in the current state and in every state.

- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is impossible (false) in any state, C2 is false.

  - 3 -> {1,2,4,5}
  - 4 -> {1,2,5}
  - 5 -> {4}
- The set {1,2,3,4} is closed (from any of those you can choose a next event still in {1,2,3,4}), so it is possible to avoid event5 forever (e.g. 2 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → ...).
- But event5 can also occur (e.g. 2 → 4 → 5).
- Thus ""event5 eventually happens"" (C1) is not forced and its negation (C2) is also not forced. Because C1 can be true in some possible sequences, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true in general.

1) What the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there exists a future state where event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., starting from the state immediately after the initial state, event1 will eventually happen.

2) Conditions (starting from the initial state where event3 has happened):
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event5 must happen.
- After event5, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event1, event5 must happen.
(Also: after event3, event4 must happen — redundant.)

3) Trace possible sequences:
- Initial: event3.
- Next: event4 (forced).
- Then: event5 (forced).
- Then: event2 (forced).
- After event2 we have a choice: either event1 or event5.
  - If we choose event1 at that point, event1 has happened (C1 true on that branch), and then event5 follows.
  - If instead we always choose event5 after every event2, the execution cycles event5 → event2 → event5 → event2 → ... forever and event1 never occurs.

4) Conclusion:
Because there exists a valid (allowed) execution that never reaches event1 (by repeatedly choosing event5 after event2), C1 is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. So C2 is False.

- From event4 one allowed next is event2 (rule: after event4 → event1 or event2 or event5).

- Thus the infinite sequence 4,2,4,2,4,... is permitted by the rules and never contains event1 or event3.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2 says C1 always holds (i.e., at every point).

From the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, one of {event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.

A counterexample trace showing C1 fails at some point:
1. t0: event1 happens (so C1 holds at t0).
2. t1: choose event2 (allowed after event1). At t1 neither event1 nor event3 happens — C1 is false at t1.
3. The rest of the obligations can still be satisfied (event2 → event5 → event4 → event1, or event5 → event3 → event4 → event1), but that does not repair the fact that at t1 C1 was false.

Since there is a reachable moment (t1) where neither event1 nor event3 holds, C1 is not always true. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happened, so the next state must be event5 (since after event3, event5 must happen).
- C2 asserts that from that next state (event5), C1 holds — i.e., event1 will eventually happen.
- But from event5 we can choose event3, and after event3 we are forced back to event5. Thus we can loop: event5 -> event3 -> event5 -> event3 -> ... forever.
- This infinite loop never produces event1, so event1 is not guaranteed to eventually occur from the next state.

Reasoning (summary):
- The context states event3 happened initially, so event3 is true at least once.
- C1 claims ""event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every subsequent step/sequence). There is no rule forcing event3 to recur, and we can produce a valid continuation without any further event3 (for example: event3 → event2 → event5 → event1 → event4 → event2 → ...). Thus C1 is not guaranteed and is false.

Reasoning:
- Start: event5 occurs initially.
- Allowed transitions (from the rules):
  - 5 -> {1,2,3,4}
  - 2 -> {3,4,5}
  - 4 -> {5}
  - 3 -> {1,2}
  - 1 -> {2,3,5}
- Consider the concrete infinite sequence 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 4, 5, ... .
  - Each step follows the rules: 5 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 5, and repeat.
  - In this sequence event1 never occurs.
  - Also event5 does not ""always"" happen (other events 2 and 4 occur), so C1 is false in this sequence.

Because there is an allowed sequence where neither event1 ever happens nor C1 holds, the disjunction C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Reasoning:

- C1 asserts that event5 happens in the next state. That is not guaranteed because from event4 the next state could be event1 or event3 instead.
- For example, take the allowed sequence: event4 (initial) → event1. In that transition the next state is event1, not event5, so C1 is false in that instance.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Hypotheses:
  - C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — interpreted as: in every possible sequence from the given start, Event1 will occur.
  - C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — requires both that Event1 occurs (in the run) and that C1 (Event1 always happens) is true.

- System transitions (from the context):
  - start: event4
  - after event4 → {event1, event3, event5}
  - after event3 → {event4, event5}
  - after event5 → {event3, event4}
  - (others exist but are not needed)

- Counterexample showing C1 is false:
  - From the initial event4, choose event3.
  - From event3, choose event5.
  - From event5, choose event3.
  - Repeat the 3 ↔ 5 cycle indefinitely: 4 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ...
  - This infinite valid sequence never contains event1, so event1 is not guaranteed to occur in all runs. Therefore C1 is false.

- Since C2 requires C1 to hold (and C1 is false), C2 is also false — even though some runs could include event1, the universal claim C1 fails, so C2 fails.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis asks whether ""If event5 eventually happens (C1), then event2 happens"" (C2).
- From the context, event5 already happened initially, so C1 holds.
- The rules say: after event5 either event2 or event4 must happen; after event4 event5 must happen. Nothing forces choosing event2 over event4.
- Therefore there is a valid sequence that satisfies all rules and never produces event2: e.g. start with event5 (initial), then choose event4, then event5, then event4, ... (5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → ...). This loop respects all constraints and never includes event2.
- Because a model exists where C1 holds but event2 never occurs, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., at every state/event, event2 holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the next state onward, event2 holds at every state.

Step 2 — Examine the rules and possible transitions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3, the rule forces the next event to be event2.
- From event2, the next event must be one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- From event1 the next must be event3; from event4 the next must be event1; from event3 the next must be event2.
- (After event5 the next is one of {1,2,3,4}, but event5 is not currently forced anywhere.)

Step 3 — Trace consequences:
- Starting initial event3 → next is event2 (so the immediate next state is event2).
- But from event2 the next could be event1 or event4 (not only event2). If it goes event2 → event1, then the next states are event1 → event3 → event2. So there are intermediate states (event1, event3) where event2 does not hold.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- C1 (""event2 always happens at every state"") is false because there are valid states (e.g., event1, event3, event4) where event2 does not hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false: even though the next state is event2, from that state it is possible to move to states where event2 does not hold, so it is not true that event2 holds at every subsequent state.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1 the next event must be one of {event2, event4, event5}.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- From the rule for event1, event4 is one allowed next event, so C1 can be true in some executions.
- But event2 and event5 are also allowed next events, so event4 is not guaranteed to occur next. Therefore C1 does not hold in all possible next states.

2. Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (stated twice)
- Other rules about what happens after event2/3/4/5 are irrelevant because no event after event1 can occur.

3. Trace consequences:
- Since event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event3 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- The consequent of C2 (""event3 happens"") is false.

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transitions
- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3 → next can be event1, event2, or event4.
- From event1 → next can be event3 or event5.
- From event5 → next can be event3 or event4.
- (Other transitions allow more choices, but the above are enough.)

Step 3 — find a counterexample
- From the initial event3, choose the transition event3 → event1.
- From event1 choose event1 → event3.
- Repeat: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... forever.
- This infinite path never visits event2 or event4, so C1 is false along that run. Also the initial state (event3) itself is not event2 or event4.

- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start at event1. Allowed next events from event1 are {3, 4, 5}.
- From event3 allowed next events are {2, 4, 5} — you can pick 4 or 5 to avoid 2.
- From event4 allowed next events are {1, 2, 3} — you can pick 1 or 3 to avoid 2.
- From event5 allowed next events are {1, 2, 4} — you can pick 1 or 4 to avoid 2.

Thus there are valid sequences that never include event2 (for example 1 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 4 → ...). So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") can hold. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true. Final answer: False."

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., every occurrence is event2).
- C2: ""Event5 happens OR C1 holds.""

We must decide whether C2 is necessarily true given the initial condition and the transition rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules (key ones)
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, either event4 or event5 must happen.
- After event4, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
(Other rules not needed for the counterexample.)

Step 3 — exhibit a valid run that falsifies C2
Start with the given initial event2, then pick transitions so that event5 never occurs:
2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ...
Each step obeys the rules:
- after 2 we pick 4 (allowed),
- after 4 we pick 2 (allowed).
This infinite sequence never contains event5, so ""Event5 happens"" is false in this run. Also C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false because the sequence contains event4 occurrences as well as event2.

Therefore there exists a valid evolution in which neither disjunct of C2 holds, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Reasoning:
- From the context, the allowed successors are:

  - 2 -> {3,5}
  - 3 -> {1,2,5} (initially 3)
  - 4 -> {1,3}

- C1 says: whenever event1 happens, event4 happens. To disprove ""always"", give a valid sequence where 1 happens but 4 never does.
- Counterexample sequence: start at 3 (given), then choose 1, then choose 2, then choose 3, then 1, then 2, ... This cycles 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 indefinitely and never uses 4 (all chosen transitions are allowed).
- Thus event1 can occur without event4 ever occurring, so C1 does not always hold.

- Hypothesis C2 = ""Event5 happens OR (if event1 happens then event2 happens)"".
- To show C2 is false it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence of events (consistent with the rules) in which neither event5 happens nor the implication (event1 ⇒ event2) holds.

Construct a counterexample sequence:
1. Initially event1 happens (given).
2. After event1 choose event3 (allowed: after event1, either event3 or event4).
3. After event3 choose event1 (allowed: after event3, either event1 or event4).
4. Repeat steps 2–3 indefinitely: 1,3,1,3,...

This infinite trace is consistent with all the rules:
- After every event1 we pick event3 (allowed).
- After every event3 we pick event1 (allowed).
- We never pick event4, so we never get to event2 or event5.
- Event5 never happens in this trace.
- Event1 happens (many times) but event2 never happens afterward — so the conditional ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" is false in this trace.

Therefore both disjuncts of C2 are false in this valid scenario, so C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens.
- From event4, event3 must happen. So event3 does occur (then from event3 → event5 → event4 → ... the cycle 4→3→5 repeats).
- Nothing in the required transitions forces event2 to occur: the cycle 4→3→5→4 does not include event2, and the only rules that could produce event2 are from event1 (which is not forced) or by choosing it after some event—there is no rule that mandates event2 in every run.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not guaranteed (it can be false by following the 4→3→5 cycle indefinitely).
- Because C2 requires both that event3 happens (true) and that C1 holds (false), C2 as a whole is false.

- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens."" (i.e. at some point in the future)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. Event5 never necessarily happens / it is not guaranteed)

We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (from the context):
- Initially: event1.
- 1 -> {2, 3, 5}
- 2 -> {3, 4}
- 3 -> {1, 4}
- 4 -> {2, 3, 5}
- 5 -> {4}

Step 3 — look for a run that avoids event5 forever:
- From 1 choose 2.
- From 2 choose 3.
- From 3 choose 1.
This yields the cycle 1 → 2 → 3 → 1, which can be repeated indefinitely and never visits event5. All choices in the cycle are allowed by the rules.

Since there exists a valid infinite run starting from the initial event1 that never reaches event5, C1 (""Event5 eventually happens"") does not hold in general. Therefore C2 is True."

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Hypothesis: C2 says ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event5 eventually happens.""

2. From the context we know event2 did happen initially, so the ""Event2 happens"" part of C2 is true.

3. Check whether event5 must eventually happen (C1). From the rules:
   - After 2 → either 3 or 4.
   - After 3 → 5.
   - After 4 → either 1 or 5.
   - After 1 → 2.
   - After 5 → 1, 2, or 3.

4. There is a valid infinite execution that avoids event5:
   - Start at 2 (given).
   - Choose the 2 → 4 branch.
   - From 4 choose 4 → 1 (not 5).
   - From 1 → 2 (forced).
   - Repeat: 2 → 4 → 1 → 2 → ...
   This cycle never visits event5, and it respects all given rules.

5. Because such a valid run exists where event5 never occurs, C1 (""event5 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed. Therefore the conjunction C2 is not guaranteed to hold.

Thus C2 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 says “event1 eventually happens” (i.e., at some point in the future event1 occurs). Initially event1 has happened, so C1 is true at the initial moment.

- C2 says “C1 always holds” (i.e., at every point in time, it is true that event1 will occur sometime in the future). In temporal-logic terms this is G(F event1).

- From the rules we have a loop among events {event1, event4, event5}:
  - After event1 → either event4 or event5.
  - After event4 → either event1 or event5.
  - After event5 → either event1 or event4.

  Thus after the initial event1 you can choose transitions to avoid event1 forever: pick event4, then event5, then event4, then event5, ... (1 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ...). Along that infinite path no further event1 occurs, so from those later states “event1 eventually happens” is false.

- Because there is a valid execution/state where F event1 fails at some times, G(F event1) (C2) does not hold.

Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Start: event4 happened initially.
2. From ""After event4, event1 must happen"" we get sequence: 4 → 1.
3. After event1, only event2 or event3 can happen (no event5).
   - If event1 → event2, then event2 → event3 (rule), and after event3 only 1, 2, or 4 can happen (no event5).
   - If event1 → event3, then after event3 only 1, 2, or 4 can happen (no event5).
4. No rule allows any event to lead to event5. Therefore, starting from the initial event4, event5 can never occur. So C1 (""Event5 does not happen"") is true.
5. C2 states: if C1 holds (event5 does not happen) then event5 happens — that is a direct contradiction. Given event5 cannot happen, the conditional (not event5 → event5) is false.

- From the context: initially event4 occurs. After event4 we may pick event1. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2 we may pick event1 again.

- C2 is ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"", which simplifies to E4 ∨ (E5 ∨ E4) ≡ E4 ∨ E5 — the same as C1.
- We only need to check whether E4 ∨ E5 is forced by the constraints given the initial event2.

Counterexample sequence that obeys all constraints and never produces E4 or E5:
- Start: event2 (given).
- After event2 → event3 (required).
- After event3 → event2 (allowed: event3 may be followed by event1, event2, or event4; choose event2).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2 happens → then event5 must happen.
- After event5 one of {event1, event2, event4} must happen. This is a nondeterministic choice.
- If we always choose event2 after event5, the system can loop: event2 → event5 → event2 → event5 → ... forever.
- In that loop no event1, event3, or event4 ever occurs, so C1 (event1 or event3 happens) is not guaranteed, and therefore C2 (event4 happens and C1 holds) is not guaranteed.
- Since there is a valid sequence of events consistent with the premises that makes C2 false, C2 is not necessarily true.

Reasoning (brief):

- From the facts, event5 did happen initially, so the first conjunct is satisfied.
- But C1 is false: after the initial event5 we must have event1, and then we may choose event3, giving the trace 5 → 1 → 3 which terminates. Event5 does not ""always"" occur thereafter (and there exists a trace where no further event5 occurs), so ""Event5 always happens"" is not guaranteed.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state, G(event3) is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transition rules
- Initially: event5 happens.
- After event5 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event2 → event3 must happen.
- After event1 → either event2 or event4 must happen. (But nothing leads to event1, so irrelevant.)
- After event4 → event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequence
- Start: state0 = event5.
- state1 must be event3 (from event5 → event3).
- From state1 (event3) we can choose event2 next (allowed by rule ""after event3 either event2 or event5"").
- So state2 = event2.
- state3 then must be event3 (from event2 → event3).
This yields the infinite sequence: event5, event3, event2, event3, event2, ...

Step 4 — check C1 at the next state
- At state1 (the ""next"" state) event3 holds now, but C1 requires event3 to hold at every future state.
- In the sequence above, state2 = event2, so event3 does not hold at state2. Therefore G(event3) is false starting at state1.

Reasoning step by step:

- Initially event5 occurs.
- After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Consider the branch where after event5 we choose event3. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. If we choose event1, then after event1 either event3 or event4 must happen. Choose event3 again. This gives a loop: 5 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... In this infinite (or arbitrarily long) trace event1 does occur, but event4 never occurs.

Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which event4 does not happen, C1 (""event1 and event4 happen"") is not guaranteed to hold in all cases. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens). C1 is ""event3 or event5 happens"".
- From the premises: initially event4 happened, and after event4 either event3 or event5 must happen. So C1 is guaranteed (event3 or event5 will occur).
- But event1 is not guaranteed by the rules. For example, take the sequence: event4 → event5 → event3 → event5 → event3 ... In this sequence event1 never occurs (5 forces 3, 3 can go to 5, and so on). Since there exists a valid continuation where event1 does not happen, we cannot conclude event1 must happen.
- Therefore C2 (which requires event1) is not necessarily true given the context.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens.
- From event1, one of event2, event4, or event5 must occur.
- If we pick event4 after event1, then by the rules event5 must occur after event4, and event4 must occur after event5. That yields an infinite 4↔5 loop.
- In that loop neither event3 nor any rule forcing event3 ever appears, so event3 need never happen.

Reasoning:

- C2 says that in that next state both event1 and event2 hold (C1 = event1 and event2).
- Nothing forces event2 to hold in the same next state. The rule ""after event1, either event2 or event5 must happen"" applies after the state where event1 holds (i.e., in the following state), not concurrently.
- A valid trace is: state0: event4; state1: event1 only; state2: (event2 or event5 as required). In state1, C1 is false, so C2 is not entailed.

- From the rules, initially event4 happened. After event4, one of event1, event2, or event3 must happen.
- There is a valid continuation choosing event1: event4 -> event1. After event1 no other events can happen, so event3 never occurs on that run.
