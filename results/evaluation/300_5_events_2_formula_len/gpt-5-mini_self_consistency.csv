Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event1 nor event2 happens).

Step 2 — apply the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen (at least once) following the initial event3.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since event1 happens, C1 is true (event1 or event2 holds).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when neither event1 nor event2 happens.

Step 2 — apply the conditions to the initial situation:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rules include: ""After event3, event1 must happen.""

Step 3 — deduce consequences:
- Since event3 happened and after event3 event1 must happen, event1 does happen.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 or Event2 happens"") is true.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- C2 says C1 does not hold, but we have C1 true, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step:

- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to happen next.
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event1 does happen, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false). That is therefore false.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" So we must decide whether, given the rules and the initial event, it is guaranteed that at some (possibly initial) time event1 or event3 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the initial condition and rules
- Initially, event3 happened. That alone already makes C1 true at the initial moment (because event3 happened).
- Transition rules (summarized):
  - 3 -> {1, 2}
  - 1 -> {5}
  - 5 -> {1, 2, 4}
  - 2 -> {1, 3}
  - 4 -> {1, 2, 3}

Step 3 — additional check of inevitability (optional)
- From 3 you either go to 1 (then C1 holds) or to 2; from 2 you go to 1 or 3 (so C1 holds). From 1 you go to 5, and 5 leads to 1/2/4; each of those paths leads back to 1 or 3 within a finite number of steps. Thus on every possible continuation, 1 or 3 occurs (and in fact 3 already occurred initially).

Conclusion
- C1 is already true initially, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point Event1 or Event3 occurs).

Step 2 — examine initial condition:
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" So at the initial moment Event3 has already occurred.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since Event3 has already happened, C1 holds immediately (Event3 is true), so C1 does indeed eventually hold.

Final answer: True

- C1: Event1 happens or Event3 happens.
- C2: C1 eventually holds.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initial event: event3.
- Transition rules: 3 -> {1,4,5}; 5 -> {3,4}; 4 -> {1,3,5}; 1 -> 4; 2 -> 1.
- C1 says: whenever event5 happens, event4 happens (we interpret this as: after an occurrence of event5 the system produces event4 rather than something else).
- From the rules, after event5 the system may produce event3 (since 5 -> 3 is allowed).
- Starting from the initial event3, choose the allowed successors to produce the infinite trace 3,5,3,5,3,5,... (at each 3 choose 5, at each 5 choose 3). This is a valid trace under the rules and never produces event4.
- In that trace, event5 happens but is not followed by event4, so C1 is false along that trace, and in fact C1 never becomes true at any later point on that trace.
- Therefore it is not the case that “C1 eventually holds” in the system (there exists a valid run where C1 never holds).

Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify: C1 is ""Event5 eventually happens."" C2 is the implication ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine conditions: The problem statement says ""Initially, event5 happened."" That already satisfies ""event5 eventually happens"" (an initial occurrence counts as eventual occurrence).

Step 3 — conclude: Because C1 is true from the initial condition, the implication ""if event4 happens then C1"" is true (an implication with a true consequent is always true, regardless of the antecedent).

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 states ""Event5 eventually happens."" The problem says ""Initially, event5 happened."" That means event5 has already occurred at the start, so the statement ""event5 eventually happens"" is true in every run (event5 occurred at time 0).
- C2 says ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true in all runs regardless of whether event4 happens, the implication (event4 → C1) is true.

(If you intended a different reading — e.g. ""if event4 happens then event5 will occur later after that point"" — that stronger temporal claim would be false: from e4 you can loop between e1 and e4 forever and never reach e5. But as stated, C2 is True.)
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event5 eventually happens.
- C2: If event4 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if 4 occurs, then event5 eventually happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event5 happened (so event5 has already occurred at the start).
- After 3 nothing else can happen (3 is terminal).
- After 1 → 4.
- After 4 → either 1 or 3.
- After 2 → either 3 or 4.
- After 5 → either 1, 2, or 4.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Because event5 happened initially, C1 (""event5 eventually happens"") is already true in the system — it happened at the start of every possible execution.
- Therefore, no matter whether event4 occurs later or not, C1 is satisfied (it does not require event5 to occur again in the future).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: Initially event5 occurs, and after event5 event1 must happen. From event1 it's allowed to have event2. After event2 it's allowed to have event3. So one valid sequence is 5 → 1 → 2 → 3, in which both event2 and event3 happen. Therefore C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, event1 must happen, so the sequence starts 5 → 1.
- After event1, event2 is one of the allowed next events, so we can have 5 → 1 → 2.
- After event2, event3 is allowed, so we can continue 5 → 1 → 2 → 3.
- Thus it is possible for both event3 and event2 to happen in a valid sequence, so C1 can hold.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 can hold, C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event5 happens, and the rules require that after event5, event1 must happen. So we have event5 → event1.
- After event1 one of event2, event3, or event4 must occur. Choose event2 (this is allowed): event1 → event2.
- After event2 one of event1, event3, event4, or event5 must occur. Choose event3 (also allowed): event2 → event3.
- Thus a valid sequence is event5, event1, event2, event3, so both event2 and event3 do happen.
- Therefore C1 (event3 happens and event2 happens) can be true, so C2 (C1 does not hold) is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 always happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event3 does not always happen).

Examine the rules (succinct):
- Start: event3 happened.
- 3 -> {1,2,4}
- 1 -> {3,5}
- 2 -> {3}
- 4 -> {1,3}
- 5 -> {1,2,3}

We need to see whether every possible continuation keeps event3 happening at every step (or forever). A counterexample suffices to show C1 does not hold.

Construct a valid sequence that avoids event3 after the initial occurrence:
- Start at 3 (given).
- From 3 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 5 (allowed).
- From 5 choose 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 ... forever.

This infinite trace contains the initial event3 but never again. Therefore event3 does not always happen. So C1 is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/event).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when C1 is false.

Step 2 — read the transition rules (summary)
- Start: event3 happened.
- 3 → {1,2,4}
- 1 → {3,5}
- 2 → {3}
- 4 → {1,3}
- 5 → {1,2,3}

Step 3 — reason about C1
- From 3 you cannot have 3 next (no 3→3), so event3 cannot occur at every step.
- Concretely, after the initial 3 pick 1 (allowed). From 1 pick 5 (allowed). From 5 pick 1, from 1 pick 5, etc. This yields an infinite sequence 3,1,5,1,5,... that never has event3 after the initial occurrence. Thus event3 does not always happen.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event3 happened.
- After event3, one allowed next is event1.
- After event1, choose event5 (allowed).
- After event5, choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat event1 → event5 → event1 → ... forever.

This infinite sequence (3, 1, 5, 1, 5, ...) contains no further occurrences of event3 after the initial one. Therefore ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) does not hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5 we may choose event1 (the rule allows either event1 or event2).
- After event1 we may choose event3 (the rule allows either event3 or event5).
- After event3 event5 must happen, and we can repeat the same choices indefinitely.

This produces a valid sequence: event5 → event1 → event3 → event5 → event1 → ... In this sequence event1 does happen (so C1 is false) and event4 never occurs. Therefore C2 (""event4 happens or event1 does not happen"") is false in this reachable run, so C2 is not guaranteed by the constraints. Hence the correct answer is False.
---
We ask whether C2 (""Event4 happens or Event1 does not happen"") must be true given the rules.

1) From the context: initially event5 occurred. After event5, either event1 or event2 must happen.
2) Consider the choice event1 happens after that (this is allowed).
3) After event1, either event3 or event5 must happen. Choose event3 (allowed).
4) After event3, event5 must happen. Then the same options repeat; nothing forces event4 ever to occur.

This sequence (event5 → event1 → event3 → event5 → ...) makes C1 false (event1 does happen) and event4 never happens, so C2 (event4 or not event1) is false in this possible scenario. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event4 happens or Event1 does not happen"") must be true given the rules. We'll check by cases starting from the initial event5.

Rules recap:
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event3 or event5 must happen.
- After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, event5 must happen.
- After event4, event5 must happen.

C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"". C2 is ""Event4 happens or C1"" (i.e., Event4 happens or Event1 does not happen).

Counterexample (showing C2 is not guaranteed):
- From the initial event5 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 we go to event5 (forced).
- Repeat: event5 → event1 → event3 → event5 → ... forever.

In this execution event1 does happen (so C1 is false) and event4 never happens, so ""Event4 happens"" is false. Hence C2 (Event4 or C1) is false in this possible sequence. Therefore C2 is not entailed by the rules.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Start at event5. From 5 the allowed next events are 2 or 4.
- From 2 the allowed next events include 1 and 3 (so 5 → 2 → 1 or 5 → 2 → 3 are possible).
- From 4 the allowed next events include 1 and 3 as well (so 5 → 4 → 1 or 5 → 4 → 3 are possible).
Thus there exist valid sequences where event1 or event3 happens, so C1 (event3 or event1) can be true. C2 is the negation of C1 (that neither 1 nor 3 happens), but since sequences exist where 1 or 3 do happen, C2 is not true in all cases — therefore C2 is False.
---

---
We ask whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. neither event3 nor event1 ever happens) follows from the given facts.

Start: event5 happened.

From the rules:
- After 5, next can be 2 or 4.
- After 2, next can be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

So there is a valid sequence: 5 -> 2 -> 1. That sequence makes event1 happen, so C1 (event3 or event1 happens) is true in that run. Therefore the claim C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true (it is falsified by this possible run).

(For completeness: there are also runs that avoid 1 and 3 entirely, e.g. 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> ... , but the existence of a run with event1 means C2 is not entailed.)

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happens, and the context requires that after event3, event2 must happen. So every valid sequence contains event2 (it occurs right after the initial event3).
- C1 states: if event4 happens then event2 happens. Because event2 already necessarily occurs in every sequence (from the initial 3→2), any sequence that contains event4 also contains event2. Thus C1 is true under the given constraints.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens"". Since C1 holds, C2 is true regardless of whether event1 occurs. Hence the hypothesis C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens, and the rules say after event3, event2 must happen. So event2 occurs in every allowed sequence.
- C1 states: if event4 happens, then event2 happens. Since event2 always occurs (it already occurs after the initial event3), C1 is necessarily true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Because C1 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 ever occurs.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., C1 ∨ event1)

We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the context (true in every allowed sequence).

Step 2 — examine the constraints:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So every allowed sequence contains event2 (right after the initial event3).
- After event2, one of event1, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event5, one of event2, event3, or event4 must happen.
- event1 and event4 are terminal (no further events after them).

Step 3 — reason about C1:
- Could event4 occur in a sequence that does not contain event2? No — every sequence begins with event3 then event2, and any occurrence of event4 must come either immediately after some event2 or after an event5 (which itself can only appear after some event2). Therefore whenever event4 occurs in any allowed sequence, event2 has occurred (earlier) in that sequence. Hence C1 is true in every allowed sequence.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- Since C1 is true in all allowed sequences, the disjunction C1 ∨ event1 is true (disjunction holds as soon as C1 holds), so C2 is entailed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""Event3 eventually happens."" The initial event is event1, and the rules state: after event1, event3 must happen. Therefore event3 does occur (in the next state), so C1 is true.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state after the initial event is a state where event3 already holds, so from that next state event3 eventually happens (immediately). Hence C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 states that event3 eventually happens.
- C2 states that C1 holds in the next state.
- Initially event1 happened, and the rule ""After event1, event3 must happen"" forces the very next state to be event3.
- At that next state event3 already holds, so ""event3 eventually happens"" is true at that state (it occurs immediately).
Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, event3 eventually happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So the very next state after the initial state is one where event3 occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- In the next state (where event3 has just happened), ""event3 eventually happens"" is true (it happens immediately, so the eventuality is satisfied).

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""  
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (i.e. C1 → event2)

Step 2 — Use the context
- The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in every allowed sequence/timeline, event2 has happened (at least once).

Step 3 — Evaluate the implication
- Because event2 already happens (initially) in every model, any timeline where C1 holds also contains event2. There is no possible timeline consistent with the rules where C1 is true but event2 does not happen.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when event5 does not happen in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event4 must happen. (So the immediate next state after the initial state is event4.)

Step 3 — trace the immediate next state:
- Since after event3 the next event must be event4, the next state cannot be event5.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (event5 does not happen in the next state), therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event4 must happen"" forces the immediate next state to be event4.
- Therefore event5 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Identify the claim: C2 asserts ""If C1 holds (event2 always happens), then event5 happens.""
- Look at the transition rules and the initial event:
  - Initially event1 happens.
  - After event1 → event4 (forced).
  - After event4 → either event1 or event3.
  - After event3 → either event2 or event4.
  - After event2 → either event1 or event4.
  - After event5 → either event1 or event3 (but there is no rule that leads to event5).
- Notice event5 has no incoming transitions, so once we start at event1, there is no way to reach event5 at any later step.
- We can produce a valid infinite sequence that makes event2 occur repeatedly (so C1 holds) while never reaching event5, for example:
  event1 → event4 → event3 → event2 → event1 → event4 → event3 → event2 → ...
  This satisfies all rules and contains event2 repeatedly, but never contains event5.
- Because a model exists where C1 is true and event5 does not happen, the implication ""If C1 then event5"" is false.
---
We want to evaluate C2: ""If C1 (Event2 always happens) holds, then event5 happens.""

- Start: event1 happened.
- From event1 we must have event4.
- From event4 we may go to event1 or event3.
- From event3 we may go to event2 or event4.
- From event2 we may go to event1 or event4.
- No rule forces event5 to ever occur (the only rule about event5 is what must follow it).

Counterexample (a valid sequence under the rules) that makes C1 true but event5 never occur:
1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → … (repeat)
- This trace contains event2 repeatedly (so C1 holds on that trace).
- Event5 never appears.

Therefore there exists a model where C1 holds but event5 does not, so the implication C2 is not guaranteed. C2 is False."

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true iff event1 does NOT happen in the next state.

Step 2 — apply the given conditions to the initial state:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, event5 must happen"" forces the very next event to be event5 (there is no alternative).

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since the next event must be event5, event1 does not happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false and C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules state that after event4, event5 must happen. That fixes the next state to event5.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules state: after event4, event5 must happen. Therefore the next state must be event5.
- C1 asserts that event1 happens in the next state; that contradicts the required event5.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true, given the context.
- C1 says: event3 happens and event5 happens.

Step 2 — restate the relevant rules
- Initially, event5 happened.
- After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal)

Step 3 — trace consequences if C1 holds (event3 and event5 happen)
- event5 has happened (it was the initial event).
- Given event5 and C1, event3 occurs (satisfying the ""either event2 or event3"" requirement via event3).
- From event3, event4 must happen.
- From event4, event2 must happen.
- Therefore, if event3 and event5 happen, event2 necessarily happens.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
First identify the claim: C2 asserts ""If C1 holds (event3 and event5 happen) then event2 happens.""

Examine the rules:
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Reasoning:
- If event3 occurs, it forces event4, which forces event2. So any execution containing event3 necessarily contains event2 later.
- The alternative after event5 (choosing event2 immediately) would prevent event3 from occurring, so that branch does not satisfy C1. Only branches where event3 does occur (and event5 does) will then produce event4 and then event2.

Therefore whenever C1 (event3 and event5) holds, event2 must happen.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 happens and event5 happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.
We must decide whether, given the context rules, C1 logically implies event2.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially, event5 happened.
- After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen (at least one of them).
- After event3, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal)

Step 3 — trace sequences when C1 holds
- event5 already happened initially.
- For C1 to hold we need event3 to happen as well. That means after event5 we must pick the branch where event3 occurs (the other branch, picking event2 immediately after event5, would prevent event3 because event2 is terminal).
- Once event3 happens, rule forces event4 to happen.
- Once event4 happens, rule forces event2 to happen.
- Therefore whenever event3 and event5 both occur, the chain 5 → 3 → 4 → 2 inevitably makes event2 occur.

Conclusion
- C1 (event3 and event5) necessarily leads to event2 under the given rules. So C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Write the allowed next-event edges: 1→5, 2→3, 3→{1,5}, 4→{1,2,3}, 5→{1,4}. Initial state: 5 has happened, so C1 is true at the start.
- From any reachable event:
  - If at 1, next is 5.
  - If at 2, next is 3, and 3 leads to 1 or 5, both of which reach 5 (1→5).
  - If at 3, it goes to 1 or 5 (so 5 occurs immediately or after one step).
  - If at 4, it goes to 1,2, or 3, and each of those leads to 5 in at most two further steps.
  - If at 5, we already have it.
- Thus from every reachable state, event5 will occur within a bounded number of steps. So ""event5 eventually happens"" holds at the initial time and at every time; therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens"" (i.e. at some future point).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. from every reachable state, event5 will eventually happen — G F event5).

Step 2 — transitions (from the problem text)
- Initial event: 5.
- 1 → 5
- 2 → 3
- 3 → {1, 5}
- 4 → {1, 2, 3}
- 5 → {1, 4}

Step 3 — check from every state whether 5 must occur later
- From 1: next is 5 (so 5 occurs).
- From 2: 2 → 3 → (1 or 5) → both lead to 5 (either directly or via 1).
- From 3: 3 → (1 or 5) → both lead to 5 (directly or via 1→5).
- From 4: 4 → 1 (→5), or 2 (→3→…→5), or 3 (→…→5). All branches reach 5.
- From 5: 5 → 1 (→5) or 4 (→…→5). Both branches lead to 5.

There is no cycle that can avoid event5 forever; every possible path hits event5 within a bounded number of steps.

Conclusion
C2 is True.
---
We want to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 = ""Event5 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 always holds"" means: from every reachable state (after any event), Event5 will eventually occur.

Examine the given transition rules (after X, Y must happen means the next event(s) are constrained):

- After event1, event5 must happen. So from event1, event5 occurs next.
- After event2, event3 must happen; after event3, either event1 or event5 must happen. So from event2 → event3 → (event1 or event5) → in either case event5 will occur within at most two steps (if event3 → event1 then next is event5).
- After event3, either event1 or event5 must happen, so event5 occurs within at most two steps (directly or via event1).
- After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen. Each of those (event1, event2, event3) leads to event5 within at most two steps (event1 → event5; event2 → event3 → ... → event5; event3 → event1 or event5 → event5).
- After event5, either event1 or event4 must happen. Both of those choices (event1 or event4) we already saw lead to event5 eventually (event1 → event5 immediately; event4 → ... → event5).

Thus for every possible current event (1,2,3,4,5), the rules force that event5 will occur after finitely many steps. Therefore C1 holds at every reachable state, so ""C1 always holds"" is True.

True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (an implication)

Step 2 — Analyze the implication:
- C1 asserts that event3 holds at all times. That directly entails that event3 happens (indeed, happens now and always).
- Therefore, whenever C1 is true, event3 is necessarily true.

Conclusion:
- The implication C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (i.e., whenever we consider the system, event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (logical implication: C1 → event3)

Step 2 — analyze the implication
- If C1 is true (event3 always happens), then in particular event3 happens. The consequent (event3 happens) follows directly from the antecedent (event3 always happens).

Conclusion
- The implication C1 → event3 is logically valid, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (i.e., at every relevant point/event, event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (i.e., C1 → event3.)

Step 2 — logical relation:
- If C1 is true (event3 always happens), then event3 indeed happens. The implication C1 → event3 is therefore trivially satisfied.

The transition rules in the context do not contradict this; they do not prevent event3 from happening if C1 holds.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" (i.e., no occurrence of event4).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is a future point after which event4 never occurs.

Step 2 — extract the transitions (duplicates removed)
- start: event2.
- 1 -> {2,3}
- 2 -> {3,4}
- 3 -> {1,2}
- 4 -> {2,3,5}
- 5 -> {1,2,4}

Step 3 — reasoning about possible traces
- From the initial event2 you can choose event4 next (2 -> 4).
- From 4 you can choose 5 (4 -> 5), and from 5 you can choose 4 (5 -> 4).
- Thus the infinite trace 2,4,5,4,5,4,... is allowed, and event4 occurs infinitely often on that trace.

Since there exists an allowed execution where event4 keeps happening forever, it is not guaranteed that at some future point event4 will never occur. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---

---
C2 says: “Eventually (permanently) Event4 does not happen” — i.e., from some point on no Event4 occurs.

Transitions (from the context):
- start: Event2
- 2 -> {3,4}
- 3 -> {1,2}
- 1 -> {2,3}
- 4 -> {2,3,5}
- 5 -> {1,2,4}

From Event2 you can go to Event4, and from Event4 you can go back to Event2. Thus there is an infinite execution 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... in which Event4 keeps occurring forever. Because such a run exists, it is not guaranteed that “eventually Event4 does not happen.” (Existence of some runs that avoid 4 does not make the property universally true.)

Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 asserts that whenever C1 holds, event5 happens.
- Counterexample from the given rules: Initially event3 happens, and after event3 either event2 or event5 must happen. Choose event2. After event2, no other events can happen. So C1 holds (event2 happened) but event5 does not happen. Therefore the implication ""if C1 then event5"" is not guaranteed.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens. From event3 the next event must be either event2 or event5.
- Take the branch where event2 happens next. After event2 no further events can occur, so event5 does not happen in that run.
- In that run C1 (""event2 or event1 happens"") is true (because event2 happened), but event5 does not happen. Thus the implication (C1 → event5) is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, either event2 or event5 must happen.
- If event2 happens, rule says no other events can happen, so the sequence ends without event5.
- In that branch C1 (""event2 or event1 happens"") is true (because event2 happened) but event5 does not happen, so the implication ""if C1 then event5"" is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. From ""After event3, event2 must happen"" we get: event3 -> event2.  
2. From ""After event2, event1 must happen"" we get: event2 -> event1.  
3. By transitivity, event3 -> event1. Thus C1 is true (whenever event3 occurs, event1 occurs).  
4. C2 says: event4 -> (event3 -> event1). Since C1 (event3 -> event1) is already true unconditionally, the implication in C2 holds regardless of whether event4 occurs. (Also, from ""After event4, event2 must happen"" and ""event2 -> event1"" we get event4 -> event1, but that is extra.)

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — translate the rules:
- event3 -> event2 (after event3, event2 must happen)
- event2 -> event1
- event1 -> (event2 or event4)
- event4 -> event2
- event5 -> (event2 or event4)
Also: event2 initially happened (but that initial fact is not needed for the implication reasoning below).

Step 2 — check C1:
From event3 -> event2 and event2 -> event1, by transitivity we get event3 -> event1. So C1 is true (it follows from the given rules).

Step 3 — check C2:
C2 states: if event4 happens, then C1 holds. But C1 is already true unconditionally (it follows from the rules regardless of whether event4 happens). Therefore the conditional ""if event4 then C1"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 says: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens.""
- So C2 asserts: event4 -> (event3 -> event1).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 -> event2)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 -> event1)
- From these two, we get a chain: event3 -> event2 -> event1, so event3 -> event1. That is exactly C1.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C1 is already entailed by the context (it holds universally), independent of whether event4 occurs.
- Therefore ""if event4 happens, then C1 holds"" is true (a conditional with a consequent that is already true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 says: ""Event3 happens and event4 happens."" So C2 is the claim that both event3 and event4 cannot both occur.

Check the rules and see if a sequence exists that yields both event3 and event4:

- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. Choose event4 → event4 happens.
- After event4, either event2 or event5 must happen. Choose event2 → event2 happens.
- After event2, event3 must happen → event3 happens.

This produces a consistent sequence event1 → event4 → event2 → event3, so both event3 and event4 do happen. (Many other consistent sequences also can yield both, e.g. event1 → event2 → event3 → event1 → event4.)

Therefore C1 can be true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 happens and Event4 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., it is not the case that both Event3 and Event4 happen).

Step 2 — examine rules and trace a possible sequence starting from the initial event:
- Initially Event1 happens.
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event4 must happen. Choose Event4.
- After Event4, either Event2 or Event5 must happen. Choose Event5.
- After Event5, either Event1, Event2, or Event3 must happen. Choose Event3.

This yields a valid sequence: Event1 → Event4 → Event5 → Event3, so both Event4 and Event3 do happen. That means C1 can be satisfied.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds in at least one valid sequence, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1 says: event3 happens and event4 happens. C2 is the negation of C1.
- Starting fact: event1 happened.
- From event1 we may choose the branch that ""after event1, event4 must happen"" (the rule allows either event2 or event4).
- After event4 we may choose the branch ""after event4, event5 must happen"" (the rule allows either event2 or event5).
- After event5 we may choose the branch ""after event5, event3 must happen"" (the rule allows event1, event2, or event3).
- That yields the sequence: event1 → event4 → event5 → event3. Both event4 and event3 occur, so C1 can hold.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- Initially event4 happened (given).
- Rule: ""After event4, event1 must happen."" So event1 will occur after the initial event4.
- Rule: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs the sequence stops.
- Therefore event1 does occur in every allowed sequence starting from the given initial state. Hence C1 (""Event1 does not happen"" — i.e. event1 never occurs) is false.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is never true (event1 does occur), C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule ""After event4, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur (at some next step).
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" then ends the run; but the important point is that event1 does indeed occur.
- C1 states ""Event1 does not happen."" That is false in every run consistent with the rules because event1 is forced by the initial event4.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false — you cannot ever reach a point where the global fact ""event1 does not happen"" becomes true, since event1 occurs.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event4 happens.
- Rule: after event4, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur (immediately next in the trace).
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen (trace terminates after event1).

C1 asserts ""Event1 does not happen."" That is false in this execution because event1 does happen. C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds. Since event1 already occurs (and C1 is a global claim that event1 never happens), C1 cannot become true later for this trace. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened, and the context explicitly says that after event5 no other events can happen. So no events besides event5 can occur.
- Therefore event4 does not happen (C1 is true).
- C2 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Because event1 cannot happen in any sequence consistent with the context (no events occur after the initial event5), the antecedent is impossible, so the implication is vacuously true.
- Thus C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happened, and after event5 no other events can happen. So no events besides event5 can occur.
- Therefore event1 never happens (antecedent of C2 is false) and event4 does not happen (C1 is true).
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, and here C1 is also true outright. Hence C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:
- C1 states: event4 does not happen.
- C2 states: if event1 happens then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event4 does not happen).
- The context says: ""Initially, event5 happened"" and ""After event5, no other events can happen."" That fixes the entire sequence to just event5; no event1 or event4 (or any other event) can ever occur.
- Therefore event1 does not happen, and event4 does not happen. In particular C1 is true.
- An implication ""if event1 happens then event4 does not happen"" is true whenever the antecedent (event1 happens) is false; here event1 never happens, so the implication is vacuously true (and moreover C1 is directly true).

Thus C2 is True."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify: C2 asserts that ""C1 (event2 or event5) holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — use the context: initially event4 happened. The rule ""After event4, either event2 or event5 must happen"" therefore requires that the next state (immediately after the initial state) has event2 ∨ event5.

Conclusion: C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event5 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state.

Step 2 — examine initial condition and rules:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- The rules include: ""After event4, either event2, or event5 must happen."" (stated twice but equivalent).

Step 3 — trace to the next state:
- Since event4 just happened, the rule forces that in the next state either event2 or event5 occurs.

This exactly matches C1 holding in the next state, so C2 is True. 

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event2 happens or Event5 happens.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., immediately after the initial state).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event4 happened.
- The context explicitly states: ""After event4, either event2, or event5 must happen.""

Step 3 — Reasoning
- Since the initial state is event4, the very next state must satisfy the ""after event4"" requirement.
- That requirement is exactly that either event2 or event5 happens — which is precisely C1.

Conclusion
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

We must decide whether the disjunction ""event4 happens OR (if event2 happens then event5 happens)"" is forced by the given rules.

1) Start from the given initial event: event5 happens.
2) From ""after event5, event2 must happen"" we get event2 next.
3) From ""after event2, event3 must happen"" we get event3 next.
4) From ""after event3, either event2 or event5 must happen"" we may choose event2. Doing so gives the repeating cycle: ...,5,2,3,2,3,2,3,... which satisfies all rules (every 2 is followed by a 3, every 3 is followed by a 2).
5) In that valid sequence event4 never occurs, so ""event4 happens"" is false.
6) Also in that sequence there are occurrences of event2 that are not followed (ever) by event5, so the implication ""if event2 happens then event5 happens"" (C1) is false (not guaranteed).
7) Therefore the disjunction ""event4 happens or C1 holds"" is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the statement: ""C1 holds or event4 happens.""
- C1 is ""Event4 always happens.""
So C2 is the disjunction: (Event4 always happens) OR (event4 happens [at least once]).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- The problem explicitly says: ""Initially, event4 happened."" So the factual claim ""event4 happens"" (i.e., event4 occurs at least once) is true from the start.
- Whether C1 (""event4 always happens"") is true is independent and can be checked separately.

Step 3 — trace/construct sequences to see if C1 might fail
- From the rules you can produce a sequence that avoids future event4s: start with the initial event4, then event2 (required after event4), then choose event1 after event2, then event2 after event1, then repeat event1→event2 indefinitely. That sequence contains the initial event4 once but does not force event4 to occur always. So C1 can be false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. We already have ""event4 happens"" true (it happened initially). Therefore C2 is true, regardless of whether C1 holds.

Final answer: True
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- C1 says ""Event4 always happens."" That would mean every step (or in every future) event4 occurs.
- From the context: initially event4 happened, and the rules are:
  - 3 -> 5
  - 5 -> (3 or 4)
  - 4 -> 2
  - 2 -> (1 or 3 or 4 or 5)
  - 1 -> 2

- C1 is false: there is a valid sequence after the initial 4 that never has 4 again. For example:
  4 (initial) -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... 
  Here after the initial 4, the system can loop 3↔5 indefinitely and never produce another 4, so event4 does not always happen.

- However, the second disjunct of C2 (""event4 happens"") is true because event4 did happen initially.

- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. So even though C1 is false, C2 (""C1 holds or event4 happens"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event4 happens"".
- We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — Relevant facts
- Initially, event4 happened. (That directly makes the atomic claim ""event4 happens"" true at least once.)
- C1 (""Event4 always happens"") may or may not be true later, but the disjunction needs only one true disjunct.

Step 3 — Conclusion
- Because event4 did happen initially, the disjunction ""C1 or event4 happens"" is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 is True."

- After event4, no other events can happen. (So event4 is terminal; there is no next event/state after that.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- In the initial state C1 is true because event4 happened (so event4 ∨ event5 holds now).
- C2 asserts that in the next state C1 holds. But there is no next state after event4 (no further events can happen).

Step 4 — conclude
- Because there is no next state after the initial event4, C1 cannot be true in a next state. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""Event5 happens or event4 happens."" That is true in the initial state because event4 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state either event4 or event5 must happen.
- But the context says: ""After event4, no other events can happen."" Since the initial event was event4, no event (including event4 or event5) can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C2 is ""Event4 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"". So C2 is false exactly when Event4 does not happen AND Event1 does happen.

- From the premises: initially Event2 happens, and after Event2 one of {Event1, Event3, Event4, Event5} must happen.

- Construct a valid sequence that makes C2 false:
  1. From Event2, choose Event1 (so Event1 happens, hence C1 is false).
  2. From Event1, Event5 must happen.
  3. From Event5, choose Event3 (allowed: either Event3 or Event4).
  4. From Event3, choose Event5 (allowed: either Event4 or Event5).
  5. Repeat the 5 ↔ 3 cycle indefinitely (5 → 3 → 5 → ...).

- In this sequence Event1 occurs and Event4 never occurs, and all constraints are satisfied. Thus C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C2 is equivalent to (event4 happens) OR (event1 does not happen). So C2 would be false only if event1 does happen and event4 never happens.
- From the context, event2 did happen. After event2 one permitted next event is event1, so event1 can occur.
- After event1, event5 must happen. After event5, we may choose event3 (instead of event4). After event3, we may choose event5 (instead of event4). This yields a valid repeating sequence: event2 → event1 → event5 → event3 → event5 → event3 → ... that never produces event4.
- That sequence satisfies all given rules while making event1 true and event4 false. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed and is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happens.
- From event2 we may choose event1 to happen next (allowed by the rule ""after event2, either event1, event3, event4, or event5 must happen"").
- If event1 happens, then event5 must happen (""after event1, event5 must happen"").
- After event5, we can choose event3 instead of event4 (""after event5, either event3 or event4 must happen"").
- After event3, we can choose event5 again (""after event3, either event4 or event5 must happen"").
- This gives a valid infinite trace: event2 → event1 → event5 → event3 → event5 → event3 → ... in which event1 does happen and event4 never happens.

Thus there is a model consistent with the rules where event1 occurs and event4 does not, so the disjunction ""event4 happens or event1 does not happen"" (C2) is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event3 always happens.""
- We must decide whether C2 is True or False (i.e., whether it is true that event3 does not always happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- event1 → event4 (after event1, event4 must happen).
- event4 → event3.
- event3 → event1.
- event5 → event1.
- event2 → event3.

Step 3 — trace the sequence from the initial condition:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- Because event1 must be followed by event4, event4 will occur after that.
- Because event4 must be followed by event3, event3 will occur after that.
- Because event3 must be followed by event1, event1 occurs again, and the cycle repeats: 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → ...
- Thus once started (and it is started by the initial event1), event3 is inevitable and will occur repeatedly.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") holds given the rules and the initial event1.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does NOT always happen).
You are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — the given conditions (rules)
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event5, event1 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur.
- Once event4 occurs, ""after event4, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur.
- After event3, event1 must happen, which brings us back to event1 and starts the same cycle again.
- This creates a guaranteed cycle: event1 → event4 → event3 → event1 → ...
- Therefore, in every possible trace starting from the given initial condition, event3 will occur (and in fact recur). Other rules about event2 or event5 do not prevent this cycle.

Step 4 — conclusion about the hypothesis
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is true.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not always happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- (Also: after event5 → event1 and after event2 → event3, but e2/e5 are not needed here.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From the initial event1, event4 must occur.
- From event4, event3 must occur. So event3 necessarily occurs.
- After event3, event1 must occur again, which forces event4 then event3 again, producing a repeating cycle.
- Therefore event3 does occur (indeed recurs) in every allowed evolution from the given start.

Conclusion
- C1 holds, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" So C1 is true at the initial state.

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means ""at every point in time, event3 will eventually happen"" (i.e., always(eventually event3)). After event3 occurs, the context says ""no other events can happen."" Thus there are no further occurrences of event3 after the initial one. While C1 is true at the initial moment, it is not true at later moments (there is no future occurrence of event3). Therefore C2 (that C1 holds at every time) is false.
---
Step 1 — what the claims mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" — i.e., in the run considered, event3 occurs at some point.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in all possible runs (and at all points therein) event3 eventually happens.

Step 2 — use the given conditions
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 has already occurred at the start.
- Also, ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Thus the run contains event3 and then terminates; there are no alternative continuations that avoid event3.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true because event3 occurs initially.
- Since the initial condition forces event3 in every run and there are no runs where event3 does not occur, C1 holds in all runs. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (There exists a future point where event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (At every point in time, it is true that event3 will eventually happen.)

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event3 happened (so C1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event3, no other events can happen — in particular, event3 does not recur.

Step 3 — reason about C2
- C2 requires that at every point in time, there is a future occurrence of event3.
- At the initial time, C1 is true because event3 has (just) occurred.
- But at any later time after that occurrence, there will be no future occurrence of event3 (it does not recur). So at those later times ""event3 eventually happens"" is false.
- Therefore C1 is not true at every point in time, so C2 fails.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- We are given that initially event5 happened.
- C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event5 happens"" — an implication P -> Q with Q = ""event5 happens"".
- Since event5 already happens (it occurred initially), Q is true in the model. An implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent.
- Therefore C1 holds.
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"". Because C1 holds, the disjunction is true.

(If one instead read C1 as requiring event5 to happen after every occurrence of event3, that temporal reading would be different; but under the plain reading used here—whether event5 happens at all—C2 is True.)

Identify hypothesis
- C1: If event3 happens, then event5 happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.

Examine the rules (deduplicated)
- start: event5 initially.
- 5 -> {1, 3}
- 1 -> {2, 3, 5}
- 2 -> {3, 5}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 5}
- 4 -> {1, 2}

Construct a counterexample sequence consistent with the rules that makes C2 false:
- Start with the given event5.
- Choose 3 next (5 -> 3 allowed).
- From 3 choose 1 (3 -> 1 allowed).
- From 1 choose 3 (1 -> 3 allowed).
- Repeat: 5, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, ...

In that infinite sequence:
- Event2 never happens, so the left disjunct of C2 is false.
- C1 is false because there are occurrences of event3 that are followed by event1 (not event5), so ""if event3 happens then event5 happens"" does not hold.

- The only rule governing what must happen immediately after event4 is: after event4, either event3 or event5 must happen.
- No rule allows event4 to occur immediately after event4.

Step 3 — trace the next-state possibilities
- From the initial event4, the next event must be either event3 or event5.
- In neither case does event4 occur in that next state.

Conclusion
- C1 (event4 does not happen) is true in the next state. Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event4 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state).

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- Rule: After event4, either event3 or event5 must happen. (Thus the next event after the initial event4 is constrained to be event3 or event5.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Since the next event must be event3 or event5, event4 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is true in the next state.

Final answer: True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (a disjunction)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened. (So ""Event2 happens"" is already true.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event3, either event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event5, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- From the initial event2, either event1 or event3 occurs next.
  - If event1 occurs next, the run ends; event3 did not occur, but event2 already happened initially.
  - If event3 occurs next (or later via cycles), then C1 holds; in that branch C2 holds via C1.
- In every possible trace, the initial event2 has already occurred, so the left disjunct of C2 is true regardless of whether event3 ever occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
C2 is true (because event2 happened initially, making ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" true). 

Final answer: True

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds (i.e., ""Event2 happens ∨ Event3 eventually happens"").

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- The context states that initially event2 happened. That means ""Event2 happens"" is true (it has already occurred).

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- Because ""Event2 happens"" is true, the disjunction in C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Final answer:
True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Identify hypotheses:
  - C1: Event3 eventually happens.
  - C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds (i.e., ""Event2 happens OR Event3 eventually happens"").
- From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means Event2 has occurred (at least at the initial moment).
- Therefore the disjunction in C2 is already satisfied by the fact that Event2 happens.
- Whether Event3 ever happens later (C1) is irrelevant — C2 is true because Event2 did occur.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds (i.e., Event1 happens OR Event3 does not happen).
You ask whether C2 is True or False given the constraints.

Examine the rules and trace possibilities:
- Start: event5 happens.
- After event5, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event3, one of {event1, event4} must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen (leading back to event4 later).

We need to see if it's possible that C2 is false. C2 is false exactly when both:
- Event1 does not happen, AND
- Event3 does happen.

Construct a valid sequence that makes C2 false:
- event5 -> event2 -> event4 -> event3 -> event4 -> event3 -> ...
This respects all rules:
- After event5 comes event2, then event4.
- After event4 we chose event3 (allowed).
- After event3 we chose event4 (allowed).
- After event4 we again chose event3, and so on.

In this infinite loop event3 does happen, and event1 never occurs. Thus C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false, and Event1 is false, so C2 is false in this permitted execution.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true; it can be false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Start: event5 has happened.
- After event5 -> event2 must happen.
- After event2 -> event4 must happen.
- After event4 -> one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen.

Consider the sequence where after each event4 we pick event3, and after each event3 we pick event4. That yields the infinite valid sequence:
5 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → ...
- This sequence is allowed by the rules (after 4 choose 3; after 3 choose 4).
- In this sequence, event3 does happen (so C1: “Event3 does not happen” is false).
- Event1 never occurs in the sequence, so “Event1 happens” is false.

Thus there exists a valid execution where both parts of C2 are false, so C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is False.
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"", i.e. ""Event1 happens or Event3 does not happen"") is true.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: 5 -> 2 -> 4. From 4 one of {1,3,5} must happen. From 3 one of {1,4} must happen.
- To falsify C2 we need Event1 to not occur AND Event3 to occur.
- Starting 5,2,4, choose 3 at the 4 step: 5, 2, 4, 3. From 3 choose 4 (not 1), then from 4 choose 3, etc. This yields an infinite valid trace 5,2,4,3,4,3,4,... in which Event3 occurs but Event1 never occurs.
- Thus there is a valid scenario where Event3 happens and Event1 does not, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just the claim that event2 occurs (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That asks whether event2 occurs at some point (now or later).

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially event2 has happened — so event2 already holds.
- Also, from the rules: after event2, either event1 or event5 must happen. Both choices lead back to event2 (2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2, or 2 -> 1 -> (4 or 5) -> 4 -> 2). So event2 will recur.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Since event2 already happened initially, C1 holds immediately, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true. It is also guaranteed to reoccur thereafter.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — that is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. ""Event2 happens eventually.""

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, Event2 has happened (so C1 already holds at the start).
- After Event2, either Event1 or Event5 must happen.
- After Event1, either Event4 or Event5 must happen.
- After Event5, Event4 must happen.
- After Event4, Event2 must happen.
- (After Event3 leads to Event5, but Event3 never appears in the start branch, so it does not affect the necessary cycles here.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial Event2
- From Event2 we must go to Event1 or Event5.
  - If Event5 occurs: then Event4 must follow, and after Event4, Event2 must follow. So Event2 recurs.
  - If Event1 occurs: then Event4 or Event5 must follow.
    - If Event1 → Event4, then Event2 must follow (so Event2 recurs).
    - If Event1 → Event5, then Event4 must follow, then Event2 must follow (so Event2 recurs).

All allowed continuations from Event2 lead back to Event2.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 already holds initially, and every possible continuation forces Event2 to occur again. Therefore ""Event2 happens eventually"" is guaranteed.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event2 has happened, so C1 (event2 and event2) is at least partially satisfied now.
- From event2, either event1 or event5 must occur.
  - If event1 occurs, then either event4 or event5 must occur. If event4 occurs then event2 must occur; if event5 occurs then event4 must occur and then event2 must occur.
  - If event5 occurs directly from event2, then event4 must occur and then event2 must occur.
- In every possible branch starting from the initial event2, a later event2 is forced. Thus a second occurrence of event2 will happen, so C1 will hold (event2 happens and event2 happens) at some point.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 claims ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e., every possible future sequence from the initial state must include event5). So we must check whether every allowed continuation from the initial event1 must eventually hit event5.

Transitions (from the problem):
- 1 -> {2, 3}
- 2 -> {1, 3, 4}
- 3 -> {1, 2, 5}
- 4 -> {2, 3, 5}
- 5 -> {2, 4}

Start at 1. There is a valid infinite path that never visits 5, for example:
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...
All those transitions are allowed and never include event5. Hence event5 is not forced to occur in every possible execution, so C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
We start at event1. From the rules:
- 1 -> {2,3}
- 2 -> {1,3,4}
- 3 -> {1,2,5}
- 4 -> {2,3,5}
- 5 -> {2,4}

To test C1 (""Event5 always happens"") we ask whether every allowed sequence starting from the initial event1 must at some point include event5. A counterexample sequence suffices to show C1 false.

Construct a valid sequence that never reaches event5:
- Start at 1 (given).
- Take 1 -> 2 (allowed).
- Then 2 -> 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 ... forever.

This infinite loop is consistent with the transition rules and never includes event5. Therefore event5 does not necessarily happen in all sequences, so C1 is false. C2 states ""C1 does not hold"", which is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Build the successor relation from the conditions:
  - succ(1) = {2,3}
  - succ(2) = {1,3,4}
  - succ(3) = {1,2,5}
  - succ(4) = {2,3,5}
  - succ(5) = {2,4}
- We start at event1. From 1 we can choose 2, and from 2 we can choose 1. Thus the infinite sequence 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... is allowed by the rules and never includes event5.
- Therefore event5 does not always happen (C1 is false), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

  - After event5 one of {event1, event2, event3} must happen.
  - After event1 one of {event2, event3} must happen.
  - After event2 event1 must happen.
  - After event3 one of {event1, event2} must happen.
  - After event4 one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen.
- Starting from event5, all forced subsequent events lie in {event1, event2, event3} and their rules only produce events in that set; no rule ever requires or produces event4. Nothing in the given constraints forces event4 to occur.
- Therefore ""Event4 happens"" (C1) does not hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret C1:
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event4 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event4 happens.""

Step 2 — follow the context rules from the initial event:
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, only event1, event2, or event3 may happen next.
- The successor rules for events 1–3 and 5 list only events 1–3 or 5; none of the rules ever produce event4 as a successor.
- There is no rule that makes event4 occur (and no path from the initial event5 to event4).

Conclusion:
- Event4 does not happen, so C1 is false.
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" — therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is just ""Event4 happens"" (since ""Event4 happens or event4 happens"" is equivalent to Event4 happens).
- The context gives rules about what must follow certain events, and the initial event is event5.
- From event5, one of event1, event2, or event3 must occur; those lead to obligations among events 1, 2, and 3. None of these rules require event4 to ever occur, but none forbid event4 either.
- Therefore event4 may or may not happen given the context; its absence is not forced.
- C2 asserts that event4 does not happen (i.e., C1 is false). That is not entailed by the premises, so C2 is not necessarily true.

Thus the correct truth value for C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning: The hypothesis C2 is ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" The premises state ""Initially, event3 happened,"" so event3 is true. Therefore the disjunction is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event3 happens.""
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The context explicitly says ""Initially, event3 happened."" So ""event3 happens"" is true (it already occurred).

Step 3 — reason about the disjunction:
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Since ""event3 happens"" is true from the initial condition, C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

(For completeness: C1 need not hold in every possible sequence — e.g. 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 … never reaches event5 — but that does not affect C2 because event3 already occurred.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" (i.e., every occurrence of event2 is followed by event5 at some step)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event1 → one of {event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event4 → event1 must happen.
- After event5 → event1 must happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 would require that every time event2 occurs it is followed (eventually) by event5.
- Counterexample path consistent with the rules: start with initial event3 → event2 → choose event1 → choose event3 → event2 → choose event1 → ... This infinite cycle 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ... never produces event5, so event2 need not be followed by event5. Therefore C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or event3 happens.""
- We already have that event3 happened initially, so the disjunct ""event3 happens"" is true.
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; therefore C2 is true (even though C1 is false).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The rules show which events can follow each event. The only rule that allows event5 to happen is ""After event3, either event2, or event5 must happen."" No other event's ""after"" set includes event5.
- Therefore if event5 happens at any point, event3 must have happened immediately before it (so event3 occurred).
- C1 asserts event5 happens (and event2 happens). That guarantees event3 happened (at least once).
- Hence ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is True.
---
Step 1 — understand hypothesis:
- C1: event2 and event5 both happen (at some times).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event3 happens.” We must decide whether C1 logically implies that event3 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the rules relevant to event5:
- The only rule that introduces event5 is: “After event3, either event2 or event5 must happen.” No rule produces event5 from any other event.
- Therefore any occurrence of event5 must be immediately preceded (in the sequence) by an occurrence of event3. In particular, event5 cannot occur unless some event3 occurred before it.

Step 3 — connect C1 to event3:
- C1 asserts that event5 happens. Because event5 can occur only following event3, event3 must have happened (at least once) whenever event5 happens.
- Thus C1 implies that event3 happens.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: both event2 and event5 occur (somewhere in the sequence).
- C2: if C1 holds, then event3 occurs.
We must decide whether every possible execution that contains both event2 and event5 also contains event3.

Step 2 — examine the rules (transitions)
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1: next must be event2, event3, or event4.
- After event2: next must be event1 or event4.
- After event4: next must be event3.
- After event3: next must be event2 or event5.
- After event5: next must be event1, event2, event3, or event4.

Step 3 — key observation
- The only rule that allows event5 to occur is ""after event3, either event2 or event5 must happen."" No rule allows event5 directly after any event except event3. Therefore any occurrence of event5 must be immediately preceded by an occurrence of event3. So event5 cannot occur without event3 occurring just before it.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- If C1 holds (event5 occurs and event2 occurs), then since event5 occurred it must have been preceded by event3. Hence event3 occurs. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happens.
- The rules state that after event4 no other events can happen. Therefore no event1 or event5 (or any other event) can occur after the initial event4.
- So C1 (""event1 or event5 happens"") is false in every allowed sequence.
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event1"". An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens, and the context states that after event4 no other events can happen. So the only event that occurs is event4.
- Therefore neither event1 nor event5 can occur; C1 (""event1 or event5 happens"") is false in every allowed run.
- A conditional ""If C1 then event1"" is true whenever the antecedent (C1) is false (vacuous truth). There is no allowed scenario where C1 holds but event1 does not.
- Hence C2 is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context says ""Initially, event4 happened"" and also ""After event4, no other events can happen."" So the only event that occurs is event4; no event1 or event5 can occur anywhere in the trace.
- C1 asserts ""event1 happens or event5 happens."" In every model of the context that statement is false (neither happens).
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- Therefore C2 is true (it holds in all models of the given context)."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- All other rules describe what can follow other events, but they only matter if those events ever occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because the initial event is event2 and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids any further events, the only possible sequence is: event2 and then stop.
- In that sequence, event5 never occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is an implication ""if event5 happens, then event1 happens."" In every possible sequence here, event5 does not happen, so the implication is vacuously true.
- Since there are no other possible sequences, C1 holds in all cases; therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True

True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1 says: whenever event5 happens, event1 happens.
- C2 says C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible execution from the initial condition).
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and the rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means no further events can occur in any execution starting from the initial state.
- Therefore event5 can never occur in any reachable execution. An implication ""if event5 then event1"" is vacuously true whenever event5 never occurs.
- Hence C1 holds in all executions reachable from the initial condition, so C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning: After event4 the rules allow either event1 or event2 to occur. So event4 does not force event1. For a concrete reachable counterexample: start with event2 → event3 → event5 → event4; after that event2 can occur (allowed), not event1. Hence ""if event4 happens then event1 happens"" is not guaranteed.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened. The rule ""After event2, either event3 or event5 must happen"" forces the next state to be event3 or event5, so event4 cannot occur in the next state under the given rules.
- Even ignoring that impossibility and assuming the hypothetical C1 (event4 happens next), the rule for event4 is: ""After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen."" That only guarantees one of {event1, event2}, not event1 specifically.
- Therefore C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is not guaranteed by the rules. It can fail (the alternative event2 could occur), so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the rules, after event4 either event1 or event2 must happen. That means event1 is not guaranteed after event4 — event2 could occur instead.
- Therefore the conditional ""If event4 happens (C1), then event1 happens"" is not entailed by the given conditions."

Sample responses:

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- Initially event3 happened, so C1 already holds at the initial moment.
- ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied because it holds now (standard temporal “eventually” allows the current moment).

(If one interpreted ""eventually"" to mean strictly later than the initial moment, there exists a future-only counterexample: from the initial event3 go to event2, then event4, then repeat 2↔4 forever; that infinite trace avoids event1 and event3 after the initial step. Under that strict-future reading, C2 would be False.)

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1 is ""event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds.
- The problem states that initially event3 happened. That means C1 is already true at the initial time (since event3 holds).
- ""Eventually"" includes the current moment (or even if you interpret it as ""at some future step,"" from the initial event3 you can follow the allowed transitions: event3 → event5 → event1 or event3, so a future occurrence of event1 or event3 is also reachable).

Therefore C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event3 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the future C1 is true).

Step 2 — use the initial condition:
- Initially, event3 happened.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Because event3 has already happened, C1 is true immediately (event3 ∨ event1 holds now).
- Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is true (it holds at the initial time).

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (formally: event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (formally: X C1)

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula event2 → event2 is a logical tautology (P → P). It is true in any state regardless of whether event2 is true there or not.

Step 3 — check C2 given the system
- From the initial state (event4) the next state must be either event2 or event3.
- In either possible next state C1 is true: if the next state is event2 then event2 → event2 is true (true → true); if the next state is event3 then event2 → event2 is true (false → false is true).
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. p → p).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- p → p is a logical tautology (always true regardless of whether p is true or false).

Step 3 — consider the next state:
- From the initial event4, the next event must be either event2 or event3. But since C1 is a tautology, it holds in every state, including whatever the next state is.

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- Hypotheses: C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens."" C2 = ""If event5 happens, then C1 holds.""
- From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So C1 is already true (event2 has occurred).
- Because C1 is true in all scenarios allowed by the context, any implication ""if event5 happens then C1"" is true (a true consequent makes the implication true).
- The fact that event5 is terminal does not invalidate C1 because event2 already occurred initially.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: If event5 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event5 happens then event2 eventually happens).

Step 2 — use the context
- The context starts with: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred at the start.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Since C1 is true (event2 has already happened), the implication ""if event5 happens then C1"" is true regardless of whether event5 occurs. An implication with a true consequent is always true.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: If event5 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., ""if event5 happens then event2 eventually happens"").

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- The very first sentence: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 has already occurred in the initial state. Therefore C1 is true (event2 has already happened, so it does eventually happen).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- An implication ""If event5 happens, then C1"" is true whenever the consequent (C1) is true, regardless of whether event5 happens or not. Since C1 is already true from the initial condition, the implication holds.

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" i.e., in the next state, event3 does not happen.

Step 2 — Examine given conditions:
- Initially, event5 happened.
- Rule: After event5, no other events can happen.
- Other rules (about event1→{3,4,5}, event2→1, event3→1, event4→1) are irrelevant if no events can follow event5.

Step 3 — Reasoning about the next state:
- Because event5 happened initially and no events can happen after event5, in the next state the only possibility is that no events occur.
- Therefore event3 does not happen in the next state.

Conclusion: C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state, event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine given conditions:
- Initially, event5 happened.
- After event5, no other events can happen.
- The other rules (after event1 → one of event3/event4/event5; after event3 → event1; after event4 → event1; after event2 → event1) cannot force any events after event5 because of the rule forbidding any events after event5.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- Since event5 happened initially and no other events can happen after event5, in the next state no events occur.
- Therefore event3 does not happen in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, Event3 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event5 happened.
- ""After event5, no other events can happen."" That means once event5 has occurred, there are no subsequent events at all (so event3 cannot occur after event5).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- We start with event5 having happened. Since after event5 no other events can happen, the next state cannot contain any events, including event3.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore, in the next state Event3 does not happen, so C1 holds in the next state.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions and the next state
- Initially event3 happened.
- From the rules, after event3, event4 must happen. So the next state is one where event4 happens (and event3 does not).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state
- C1 is the tautology p → p, which is true in every state (true whether p is true or false).
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state (where event4 happens).

Conclusion
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the formula (event3 → event3).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. the next-state operator applied to C1).

Step 2 — examine the transitions and the next state
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rules require that after event3, event4 must happen. So in every immediate successor state event4 holds (and event3 does not hold there, unless another rule makes it also hold, but we know at minimum event4 holds).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in that next state
- C1 is the implication (event3 → event3), which is a tautology: an implication p → p is always true regardless of whether p is true or false.
- Therefore C1 is true in the next state (and in every state).

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:
- C1 is the formula ""if event3 happens, then event3 happens"", i.e. event3 -> event3. That is a propositional tautology: p -> p is true in every state (true whenever p is true, and also true when p is false).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 holds in every state, it certainly holds in any successor state.
- Concretely: from the initial state (event3) the next state must be event4 (because after event3, event4 must happen). In that next state event3 is false, so event3 -> event3 is true there. Every other reachable state likewise satisfies the tautology.

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):
- Let P = ""event1 happens"" and Q = ""event4 happens"". Then C1 is (P → Q) and C2 is (P ∨ (P → Q)).
- In classical logic P ∨ (P → Q) is always true:
  - If P is true, the disjunction is true.
  - If P is false, then (P → Q) is vacuously true, so the disjunction is true.
- Applied to the event system: either event1 occurs (so C2 holds), or event1 never occurs (so the implication “if event1 happens then event4 happens” is vacuously true, and C2 holds). 

Thus C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event2 happens or Event3 happens"". We must decide whether, given the rules, it is inevitable that at some point Event2 or Event3 will occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions starting from the initial event1:
- After event1, one of {event3, event4, event5} must happen.
  - If event3 happens, C1 holds immediately.
  - If event5 happens, then event3 must happen next, so C1 holds.
  - If event4 happens, then either event2 or event3 must happen next.
    - If event3 happens, C1 holds.
    - If event2 happens, C1 holds (and then event4 must follow, possibly repeating 4↔2, but event2 already occurred).

Step 3 — conclusion:
In every possible allowed continuation from the initial state, either event2 or event3 occurs at some point. Therefore C1 eventually holds in all cases, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
C2 asserts that eventually (at some point after the start) either event2 or event3 occurs.

From the facts:
- Start: event1 has happened.
- After event1, one of {event3, event4, event5} must happen.
  - If event3 happens, C1 (event2 or event3) holds immediately.
  - If event5 happens, then event3 must happen next, so C1 holds.
  - If event4 happens, then either event2 or event3 must happen next, so C1 holds.
- (If event2 happens, it may force event4 and further steps, but C1 has already held at that point.)

Every possible branch from the initial state leads to event2 or event3 at some point. Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point in every execution trace, either event2 or event3 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and possible successors
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, one of {event3, event4, event5} must happen next.
- After event3 no further events can occur (event3 is terminal).
- After event5, event3 must happen (so event5 → event3).
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen (event4 → event2 or event4 → event3).
- After event2, event4 must happen (event2 → event4).

Step 3 — consider each branch from event1
- If event3 happens after event1 → event3 has occurred, so C1 holds immediately.
- If event5 happens after event1 → by rule event3 must then happen, so event3 occurs and C1 holds.
- If event4 happens after event1 → by rule either event2 or event3 happens next:
  - If event3 happens, C1 holds.
  - If event2 happens, C1 holds (and event2 may lead to event4 then more events, but event2 already occurred).

In every possible branch originating from the initial event1, either event2 or event3 occurs at some point.

Conclusion: C1 inevitably becomes true at some point, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis: C1 = ""event1 or event4"". C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"".
- From the context: initially event2 happened. The rule ""After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen"" constrains the immediate next state to have event1 or event4.
- Therefore in the next state C1 (event1 or event4) is true.

Hence C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, either event1, or event4 must happen"" means in the next state one of {event1, event4} must occur.
- C1 is ""event1 happens or event4 happens"".
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happens.
- The rule ""After event2, either event1 or event4 must happen"" forces the very next state to contain event1 or event4.
- C1 is exactly ""Event1 happens or event4 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Because the next state (following event2) must contain event1 or event4, C1 indeed holds there.

Therefore C2 is True."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C2 says: if event3 happens then both event1 and event5 happen (C1).
- Initially event5 has happened (so event5 is true at the start).
- Consider this allowed sequence: event5 (initial) → event4 (after event5 choose event4) → event3 (after event4 choose event3).
  - event3 has now happened.
  - After event3 we may choose event4 again, and repeat event4 → event3 forever.
- In that trace event5 did occur (initially) but event1 never occurs. Thus C1 (event1 and event5) is false while event3 did happen, which refutes the implication.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 requires that event1 happens and event5 happens. event5 already happened initially, so to satisfy C1 we must eventually see event1.
- Start at the initial event5. One allowed next step is event4 (after event5, either event1 or event4 must happen).
- From event4 we may go to event3 (after event4, event1, event2, event3, or event5 must happen).
- From event3 we may go back to event4 (after event3, either event4 or event5 must happen).
- Thus there is a valid execution: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... which visits event3 but never visits event1.
- In that execution event3 occurs (antecedent true) but C1 is false (event1 never occurs, even though event5 did at the start). Hence the implication ""If event3 happens then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event5 happens.""
So C2 claims: any sequence in which event3 occurs must also contain both event1 and event5 (somewhere in the sequence).

Step 2 — rules summary (from the context)
- Initially event5 occurs.
- From 5 → next is either 1 or 4.
- From 4 → next is 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- From 3 → next is 4 or 5.
- From 1 → next is 4 or 5.
- From 2 → next is 1, 3, or 5.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample sequence where event3 occurs but event1 does not
- Start: 5 (given).
- Choose 4 after 5: 5 → 4.
- Choose 3 after 4: 5 → 4 → 3.
- From 3 choose 4, from 4 choose 3, and repeat: 5 → 4 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ...
This infinite (or finite-prefix) sequence contains event3 and event5 (the initial 5) but never contains event1.

Since there is a valid sequence where event3 happens but event1 does not, C1 is not guaranteed whenever event3 happens. Therefore C2 is False.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Identify the hypothesis
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds (Event2 always happens), then event4 happens."" We must decide whether event4 is forced whenever event2 happens.

Key transition rules (from the context)
- Start: event3.
- 3 -> {1, 2, 4, 5}
- 1 -> 2 (forced)
- 2 -> {3, 5}
- 5 -> {1, 4}
- 4 -> 2 (forced)

Find a counterexample
- From the start at 3, choose 3 -> 2 (so event2 occurs).
- From 2 choose 2 -> 3.
- From 3 choose 3 -> 2 again.
- Repeat: 3,2,3,2,... is a valid infinite trace under the rules.

This trace satisfies C1 (event2 happens repeatedly), but event4 never occurs. Therefore C1 can hold while event4 does not happen, so the implication in C2 is not valid.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (stepwise):
- Start: event3 happened.
- From event3 we may choose event1; from event1 event2 is forced; from event2 we may choose event3. So the cycle 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 is allowed by the rules.
- That cycle repeats indefinitely, so event2 occurs repeatedly (infinitely often) while event4 never occurs.
- Therefore, even under the assumption that event2 always (repeatedly) happens, event4 is not forced to happen. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the initial event3, every immediate choice leads to event2 eventually: 3→1→2, 3→2, 3→4→2, 3→5→1→2, or 3→5→4→2. So C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true (event2 is inevitable).
- However, C2 claims that once C1 holds, event4 must happen. That is false: there is a valid execution that never visits event4 but does include event2 repeatedly, e.g. the cycle 3→2→3→2→… which never reaches event4 but satisfies C1.
- Therefore the implication in C2 does not hold."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 occurs.
- The rule ""After event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 next.
- The rule ""After event3, either event2 or event5 must happen"" means that immediately after event3 the next event is either event2 or event5 — not event4.
- C1 asserts ""Event4 happens in the next state."" C2 asserts ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., after event3 the next event is event4).
- Since after event3 the next event can be event2 (or event5), event4 is not guaranteed to occur immediately after event3. Therefore the implication in C2 is not always true.

Thus C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the rules, after event3 the next event must be either event2 or event5 (3 -> {2,5}). There is no rule that forces event4 immediately after event3.
- Thus there exists a possible next-state (namely event2) after event3 that is not event4, so C1 (""event4 happens in the next state"") can fail when event3 happens.
- Therefore the implication ""if event3 happens then C1 holds"" is not guaranteed.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., if event3 occurs now, then event4 must occur in the next state)

Step 2 — Examine the rules
- Initially: event2.
- 2 -> 3 (event2 must be followed by event3).
- 3 -> either 2 or 5 (after event3, next is 2 or 5).
- 5 -> either 1 or 4.
- 1 -> either 3 or 5.
- 4 -> either 1 or 5.

Step 3 — Trace a counterexample
From the initial state: 2 -> 3 (forced). From 3 we are allowed to go to 2 (since 3 -> 2 or 5). So we get the two-step trace: 2 (initial) -> 3 -> 2. Here event3 happens, but the next state is event2, not event4.

Step 4 — Conclusion
Because there is a valid transition where event3 happens and the next state is not event4, C2 (""If event3 happens, then event4 happens next"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event5 must happen"" forces event5 to occur (immediately after event1), so C1 (""event5 eventually happens"") is true.
- C2 states that ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. eventually event5 will eventually happen). Since C1 already holds now, C2 is true as well. (Also in temporal logic F F p ≡ F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1.)
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point the statement ""event5 eventually happens"" will be true).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event5 must happen — so from the initial point, event5 is guaranteed to occur at some future point.

Step 3 — Trace consequences:
- Because event1 has occurred and it requires event5 to follow, C1 (""event5 eventually happens"") is true at the initial point.
- If C1 is already true now, then ""C1 eventually holds"" is also true (a property that is true now is certainly true at some future point). Also, in temporal logic F F p ≡ F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1.

Conclusion:
C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point, C1 will be true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event5 must happen. Therefore event5 will occur at some point after the initial event1.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- From the above, C1 is true (event5 will eventually happen).
- C2 asserts that at some future point C1 will hold. Since C1 already holds (given the guarantee from event1), C2 is also true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3. After event3, event2 or event5 must occur. Choose event2 (a permitted next state).
- After event2, event3 or event4 must occur. Choose event4 (permitted).
- At that point event4 has happened, but there is no rule forcing event1 to happen; instead after event4 event2 must happen.
- So there is a reachable situation (3 → 2 → 4) where event4 occurs without event1. That refutes C1, and hence C1 does not hold in the next state.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event4 -> event1) — if event4 happens then event1 happens.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state.

Step 2 — use the given conditions to determine the next state:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the next state must have either event2 or event5.

Step 3 — check C1 in each possible next state:
- If the next state has event2, then event4 does not occur in that state, so the implication (event4 -> event1) is vacuously true.
- If the next state has event5, likewise event4 does not occur in that state, so the implication is vacuously true.

Since in every possible next state C1 is true, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3, the next state must have either event2 or event5.
- In either possible next state (event2 or event5), event4 does not occur there, so the antecedent of C1 (""event4 happens"") is false.
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C1 holds in every possible next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 states ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and so is true in every state regardless of whether event3 actually occurs.
- C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds. Because C1 holds at every moment (including the initial state), it certainly holds at some future moment — hence ""eventually C1"" is true.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (i.e. event3 → event3)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula event3 → event3 is a logical tautology (any proposition implies itself). It is true in every state/point of any execution, independent of which event actually occurs.

Step 3 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 is true immediately (and therefore at every state), it certainly holds at some future point — indeed it holds now. Thus ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" That is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 is true at every point in time regardless of the event structure.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately (and always), it certainly holds at some future point — hence C2 is true."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because starting from the initial event3 you can choose transitions that never lead to event2 (for example: 3 → 1 → 5 → 3 → 1 …), so event2 need not occur.
- Therefore any implication ""if event4 happens then C1 holds"" can be refuted by a run where event4 occurs but event2 still never happens. Example counterexample: 3 → 4 → 1 → 5 → 3 → 1 … — event4 occurs but event2 never occurs. Hence C2 is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false: from the initial event3 you can choose event1, then event3, then event1, etc., forever avoiding event2.
- To refute C2 (""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"") it suffices to find a run where event4 occurs but event2 does not always happen. Counterexample run:
  - Start: event3 (given).
  - Choose event4 (allowed after event3).
  - After event4 choose event1 (allowed).
  - After event1 choose event3 (allowed).
  - Repeat event1 → event3 forever.
  This run includes event4 but never includes event2, so event2 does not always happen even when event4 occurs. Hence C2 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the rules: after 3 → {1,4,5}; after 4 → {1,2,3}; after 1 → {3,5}; after 5 → {3}; after 2 → {3}.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false: there is a valid infinite trace that never includes event2, e.g. 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (choosing 1 after every 3). Event2 never occurs there.
- C2 claims: if event4 happens, then event2 always happens. This is false because we can exhibit a trace that contains event4 but never event2, e.g. 3 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (after 4 choose 1, then loop 3→1). That run contains event4 yet never contains event2.

Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'True': 2, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur (eventually) after the initial event1.
- Once event4 occurs, ""no other events can happen,"" so the run terminates with event4 having happened.
- Therefore in every possible continuation from the given initial state, event4 eventually happens (C1 holds), so C1 always holds (C2 is True).
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens.
- The rule ""After event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur next.
- After event4, no other events can happen, so the trace ends with event4 having occurred.

Thus C1 (""event4 eventually happens"") is true for the execution starting from the initial state. But C2 (""C1 always holds"") says that at every point in time from then on, event4 will still eventually happen. After the terminal state reached by event4, there is no future occurrence of event4, so the property ""event4 eventually happens"" is not true at that later point. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event4 eventually happens (there is some future point where event4 occurs).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., on every possible run/execution, event4 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen (event4 is terminal).
- Other rules (after event2, after event3, after event5) do not apply initially because we start from event1 and the rule after event1 forces the next event.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Starting from the initial event1, the rule ""after event1, event4 must happen"" forces event4 next.
- Thus event4 will occur on the next step, and then the run terminates (no further events).
- There is no alternative choice that avoids event4 from the initial state.

Step 4 — conclusion
- On every possible run starting from the given initial condition, event4 does occur. Therefore C1 holds on all runs, so C2 is True.

False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens.
- From event2 you may choose event3 (since after event2 either event3 or event5 must happen).
- From event3 you may choose event4 (since after event3 either event4 or event5 must happen).
- From event4 you may choose event2 (since after event4 either event1 or event2 must happen).

This yields the infinite cycle: event2 → event3 → event4 → event2 → ... in which event4 keeps occurring. Along that trace C1 (""Event4 does not happen"") is false, so C1 never eventually becomes true. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed and is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start: event2 occurs.
- From event2 the system may go to event3 or to event5.
- If it goes to event5, the sequence ends (so event4 never occurs on that branch).
- But if it goes to event3, then from event3 the system may go to event4 (or to event5). Thus there exists a continuation 2 → 3 → 4.
- Because a continuation exists in which event4 does occur, the statement ""Event4 does not happen"" is not guaranteed, so ""Event4 does not happen"" does not eventually hold in all runs.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 is ""event1 does not happen.""  
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event3 happens,"" i.e. (not event1) OR (event3).

C2 would be false only if event1 does happen AND event3 does not happen.

From the initial condition: event5 happens first. After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- If we choose event3 after event5, then event3 happens and C2 is true.
- But we can instead choose event2 after event5. After event2, one allowed next event is event1. If we take that, event1 happens and, because after event1 no other events can happen, event3 never occurs.

This possible sequence (event5 → event2 → event1) makes event1 happen and prevents event3, so C2 is false in that scenario. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed and the correct answer is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or event3 happens. So C2 ≡ (not event1) OR event3. Equivalently, C2 fails exactly when event1 happens AND event3 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — produce a valid sequence that tests C2:
- Choose after event5 → event2 (allowed).
- Then choose after event2 → event1 (allowed).
- Sequence: 5 → 2 → 1. This is a valid sequence under the rules.
- In this sequence event1 does happen and event3 does not happen.

Step 4 — conclude:
- In that sequence C1 is false and event3 is false, so C2 is false.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed) by the context.

Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or event3 happens, i.e. (not event1) OR event3. (Equivalently: if event1 happens then event3 happens.)

Step 2 — Use the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event5 happened.
- From event5 the next event can be event2 or event3.

Step 3 — Find a counterexample sequence if one exists:
- Choose the branch event5 → event2 (allowed).
- From event2 one allowed next event is event1 (since after event2 either 1, 3, or 4 must happen).
- So the sequence 5, 2, 1 is permitted. It contains event1 and does not contain event3 (event1 is terminal).

In that permitted sequence C1 is false (event1 does happen) and event3 is false, so C2 = (false) OR (false) = false.

Therefore C2 is not necessarily true given the context.

Sample responses:
We are asked about C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (C1: ""Event1 always happens."")

Step-by-step reasoning
- Initial event is event4. From event4 a successor of event1 is allowed, so event1 can occur.
- C2 claims: whenever event1 happens, it implies C1 (that event1 happens at all times / in every step).
- But after event1 the allowed next events are event2, event3, or event4 — none of which are event1. Concretely, from the initial 4 we can take the path 4 → 1 → 2. At the second step (event2) event1 is not happening, so event1 does not ""always"" happen.
- Therefore there is a reachable run where event1 occurs but is not true at all times afterward, so the implication in C2 fails.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens."" That is false because initially event4 happened, so event1 does not hold at that time.
- C2 says ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. occurrence of event1 would imply event1 always happens.
- From the rules, event1 can occur (for example 4 -> 1 is allowed), so the antecedent of C2 can be true in a run.
- But C1 is false (as shown above), so there exists a situation where event1 happens but C1 does not hold; hence the implication C2 is false.
---
Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" i.e. ""If event1 occurs at some point, then event1 always occurs.""

Examine the transition rules (edges):
- 1 -> {2, 3, 4}
- 2 -> {5}
- 3 -> {2, 4, 5}
- 4 -> {1, 3, 5} (initial event is 4)
- 5 -> {1, 3}

We need to check whether every run that contains an occurrence of event1 must have event1 at every step thereafter (i.e. ""always"").

Find a counterexample run:
- Start at 4 (given), go 4 -> 1 (so event1 happens), then 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> ... 
- The cycle 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 avoids event1 entirely, so after the initial occurrence of event1 we can continue forever without any further event1 occurrences.

Thus there exists a run where event1 happens but does not ""always happen,"" so the implication in C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event5 happened, so the disjunct ""event5 happens"" is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens"" — a disjunction — so it's true regardless of C1.
- (For completeness: C1 is false — e.g., take the infinite sequence 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 … which never includes event2.)
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event5 happens.""

Step 2 — Use the facts:
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event5 happened."" So ""event5 happens"" is true (at least at the initial step).

Step 3 — Evaluate the disjunction C2:
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Since ""event5 happens"" is true from the premises, C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false: starting from the initial event5, take 5 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 5 → 4 → ... (choose transitions 4→3, 3→1, 1→5, 5→4). This infinite loop never includes event2, so event2 is not inevitable.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event5 happens."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Even though C1 is false, event5 did happen initially, so the disjunction is true at the start.

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- Start: event3 occurs.
- From event3 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- From event1 the next is in {event2, event3, event4}; from event2 it's in {event3, event4}; from event4 it's in {event1, event3}.
- None of these allowed successor sets include event5, so once we start at event3, only events from {1,2,3,4} can ever occur.
- Therefore event5 cannot happen in any reachable sequence. That means C1 (event5 does not happen) holds, and it holds in all possible executions.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 says ""Event5 does not happen."" So C2 asserts that event5 never occurs in any possible sequence given the rules and the initial condition.

Given:
- Initially event3 happened.
- Transitions:
  - 3 -> {1,2,4}
  - 1 -> {2,3,4}
  - 2 -> {3,4}
  - 4 -> {1,3}
  - 5 -> {1,3,4}

Observe that none of the allowed successors of 1,2,3,4 include event5. Since the system starts at event3 and every subsequent event must be one of the listed successors, event5 is unreachable. The rule for ""after event5"" is irrelevant because event5 can never occur (no rule produces it from the reachable events). Hence event5 does not happen in any possible future, so C1 always holds.

Final answer: True
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event5 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., event5 never happens in any possible sequence).

Now examine the rules and reachable events starting from the initial state:
- Initial event is event3.
- From event3, the allowed next events are event1, event2, or event4.
- From event1, allowed next events are event2, event3, or event4.
- From event2, allowed next events are event3 or event4.
- From event4, allowed next events are event1 or event3.
- There is a rule for ""after event5 ..."" but no rule ever allows a transition to event5.

Because no rule permits moving to event5 from any of the reachable events {1,2,3,4}, event5 can never occur in any sequence starting from the given initial event3. Therefore C1 is true in all possible runs, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 says: ""If event5 eventually happens (C1), then event4 happens."" That is, in any valid run where event5 occurs at some point, event4 must (also) occur at some point.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event4 has already happened.
- Event5 is terminal (after event5 no events can happen).
- The other rules only constrain which event can follow which, but they do not prevent the initially happened event4 from having occurred.

Step 3 — reason about runs where event5 happens
- Any run starts with the initial event4. So every run in which event5 eventually occurs includes that initial event4 in its prefix (for instance e4 → e3 → e5 is possible).
- Therefore whenever C1 holds (there is a run where event5 eventually happens), event4 has already happened in that run.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 has already happened, so every possible run contains event4.
- The rules allow event5 to occur (e.g. 4 -> 3 -> 5), and after event5 no further events happen.
- Because event4 happened at the start of every run, whenever event5 eventually happens in a run, event4 has (already) happened in that same run.
Therefore the implication ""if event5 eventually happens then event4 happens"" is true.
---
True

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event5 eventually happens.""
- C2 says ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" — i.e., in any run where Event5 eventually occurs, Event4 occurs at some point.
- The system statement begins with ""Initially, event4 happened."" That means every run (including any run where Event5 later happens) already contains Event4 (at the start).
- Therefore whenever Event5 eventually happens, Event4 has occurred (from the initial condition). No counterexample run exists.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 always happens (i.e., every possible future sequence includes event3).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., it is not true that event3 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial event:
- Initially event5 happened.
- From 5 → either 1 or 2.
- From 1 → either 3 or 4.
- From 4 → either 1, 2, or 5.
- (Other rules: 2 → 3/4/5, 3 → 1, etc.)

Step 3 — construct a valid sequence that avoids event3:
- Start: 5 (given).
- Choose 5 → 1 (allowed).
- Choose 1 → 4 (allowed).
- Choose 4 → 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 ... forever.

Every transition used is permitted by the rules, and this infinite sequence never contains event3. Therefore event3 does not always happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Start: event5 happened.
- From event5 we may choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 we may choose event4 (allowed) — this avoids event3.
- From event4 we may choose event5 (allowed).
- Now we can repeat the cycle 5 → 1 → 4 → 5 indefinitely, never choosing event3.

Because there exists a valid infinite sequence consistent with the rules that never contains event3, ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False. C1 says ""Event3 always happens"" — i.e., in every possible continuation from the initial event, event3 must eventually occur. So C2 is True exactly when there exists some legal sequence that never produces event3.

Start: event5.

Look for a legal infinite path that avoids event3. Use the allowed transitions:
- After event5: next can be event1 or event2.
- After event1: next can be event3 or event4 — choose event4 to avoid event3.
- After event4: next can be event1, event2, or event5 — choose event5.
- After event5: again choose event1, then from event1 choose event4, then event5, and so on.

Thus one valid infinite cycle is: 5 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 4 → 5 → ... This sequence respects all given constraints and never includes event3. Therefore event3 is not guaranteed to always happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: If event4 happens, then C1 holds. In other words, C2 claims: whenever event4 occurs, event1 does not occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen. (This gives a 2↔4 loop: event2 → event4 → event2 → ...)
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, event5 must happen; after event5, event2 must happen. (These connect only if event1 → event3 occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about possibility
- From the rules, event4 does indeed occur (because initial event2 forces event4, and 4 forces 2, etc.).
- Nothing in the rules forbids event1 from occurring at some time. If event1 does occur, its requirement (that one of event2, event3, event4 follows) can be satisfied (e.g., by event2 or event4), so no contradiction arises.
- Therefore there is a valid timeline in which both event4 and event1 occur (for example: initial event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → event1 → event2 ...).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because a model exists where event4 happens and event1 also happens, the implication ""if event4 happens then event1 does not happen"" is not guaranteed by the premises.
Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens, and rule ""after event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 to occur.
- Nothing in the rules forbids event1 from occurring at some later point.
- For example: start with event2 (initial), then event4 (by event2→event4), then let event1 occur. After event1 we can choose event2 to follow (event1→event2), and the required successor rules are all satisfied.
- This sequence shows event4 can occur while event1 also occurs, so ""if event4 happens then event1 does not happen"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the premises.

Step 1 — what C2 asks
- C2 is the disjunction: ""Event1 happens"" OR ""Event4 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the premises
- The very first premise states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" That asserts Event1 has occurred.

Step 3 — conclude
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Since Event1 has happened (from the premises), C2 is true regardless of whether Event4 ever happens.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens OR Event4 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
The context begins ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means event1 has occurred (at the start of the trace).

Step 3 — reason about the disjunction
Since event1 already happened, the left disjunct ""Event1 happens"" is true, so the whole disjunction C2 is true (regardless of whether event4 ever occurs).

Answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 (Event4 eventually happens) holds.""
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means Event1 does happen (at the initial time).
- Therefore the disjunction ""Event1 happens or Event4 eventually happens"" is already satisfied by the fact that Event1 happens.
- Whether Event4 eventually happens (C1) is irrelevant to the truth of C2.

Thus C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the hypotheses:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., in every allowed sequence/event trace).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (the negation of C1).

Now examine the rules and possible sequences:

- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event5} must occur.
- If event5 occurs, no other events can happen (terminal).

A valid sequence is: event1 → event5. This sequence is allowed by the rules (after event1 we may choose event5), and it contains no event2. Therefore event2 does not occur in every allowed sequence, so C1 is false.

Thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" means every possible sequence of events (consistent with the context) contains event2.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" means C1 is false (there exists at least one valid sequence where event2 does not occur).

Step 2 — examine the rules and find a counterexample to C1:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules allow that after event1 either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
- If after event1 we choose event5, then ""after event5, no other events can happen,"" so the sequence stops at event5.
- That sequence is event1 -> event5 and contains no event2.

Because such a valid sequence exists where event2 does not occur, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.

Conclusion:
C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
We are given rules about what events can follow each event and asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 states ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., in every allowed sequence event2 occurs).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen.
- Choosing event5 immediately after event1 is allowed (it is one of the required options).
- After event5 no other events can happen, so the sequence ends: event1 → event5.
- This sequence contains no event2, so there exists at least one allowed sequence where event2 does not happen.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rule says: after event4, either event3 or event5 must happen next. That excludes event4 as the next event.
- Therefore C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold, which is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 claims: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""
- C2 claims: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event4 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine transitions from the initial state:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From event4 the only allowed next events are event3 or event5.

Therefore the immediate next state must be event3 or event5, not event4. So C1 is false, and C2 (that C1 does not hold) is true.

True

Reasoning:

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify given facts and rules:
- Initially event4 happened.
- Transitions: 4 -> (2 or 3); 2 -> (1 or 3); 3 -> (1 or 4); 1 -> (2 or 3 or 4).
- Also: after event5, event3 must happen (so 5 -> 3).
- No rule makes event5 happen nor is event5 stated to have happened initially.

Step 2 — evaluate C1 (event3 happens and event5 happens):
- Event3 can occur (choose 4 -> 3), so ""event3 happens"" is possible.
- There is no way to derive or force event5 from the given facts/rules, and it was not given as initially happening. Therefore ""event5 happens"" cannot be established.
- Thus C1 is false (it requires event5).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 (C1 holds or event4 happens):
- Even though C1 is false, event4 does happen initially.
- Therefore C2 = (false or true) = true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We need to check whether ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is guaranteed by the rules.

C1 = (event4 happens) OR (event1 happens).
We must see whether in every possible valid sequence, once C1 holds (i.e. either 4 or 1 occurs sometime), event2 will necessarily occur.

Counterexample (valid sequence following the rules) showing C2 fails:
- Start: event5 (given).
- From 5 -> choose event4 (allowed: 5 → {2,4}). Now C1 holds (event4 happened).
- From 4 -> choose event3 (allowed: 4 → {2,3}).
- From 3 -> choose event1 (allowed: 3 → {1,2,4}).
- From 1 -> choose event3 (allowed: 1 → {2,3}).
- From 3 -> choose event1, and so on.

This infinite run 5,4,3,1,3,1,... always follows the allowed transitions and never includes event2. Thus C1 can hold (event4 has occurred) without event2 ever happening.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
We must decide whether ""If (event4 or event1) happens, then event2 happens"" is logically forced by the given constraints.

Look for a counterexample trace consistent with the rules where C1 (event4 or event1) holds but event2 never happens.

Start with event5 (given). After event5 we may pick event4 (the rule allows event2 or event4). After event4 the rule allows event2 or event3 — pick event3 to avoid event2. After event3 the rule allows event1, event2, or event4 — pick event4. Repeating the choices event4 → event3 → event4 → ... is allowed by the rules and never produces event2, while event4 has occurred (so C1 holds).

Thus there is a valid sequence where C1 is true but event2 never happens. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event4 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""
We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the given rules.

Examine the rules (condensed):
- Start: 5 happened.
- 5 -> {2,4}
- 2 -> {3,4}
- 4 -> {2,3}
- 3 -> {1,2,4}
- 1 -> {2,3}

Find a counterexample path where C1 holds but event2 never happens:
- Choose 5 -> 4 (so C1 holds because event4 happens).
- From 4 choose 3 (allowed).
- From 3 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 3 (allowed).
- Repeat 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 ... forever.

This infinite path contains event4 (so C1 is true) but never contains event2 (we always choose the non-2 options). Therefore C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 occurs. By the rule ""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"", the next state is either event2 or event3.
- To show C1 (""if event1 happens then event4 happens"") fails in that next state, it suffices to exhibit a possible future from that next state where event1 occurs but event4 never does.
- If the next state is event2, the rule ""After event2, either event1, event3, event4, or event5 must happen"" lets us choose event1. From that event1 we can again choose event2 (or event3 then event2), and repeatedly choose event1←→event2 (or via event3) forever, never choosing event4. Thus there is a possible future where event1 occurs but event4 does not.
- The same reasoning holds if the next state is event3 (event3 must lead to event2, and from event2 we can reach event1 without ever choosing event4).

Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" (a state formula: event1 → event4)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state, does event1 → event4 hold?

Step 2 — use the given transitions from the initial state:
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule: ""After event1, either event2, or event3 must happen."" So the next state must be either event2 or event3.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in that next state:
- In the next state the event is either event2 or event3, so event1 does not occur there.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true, so event1 → event4 is true (vacuously) in that next state.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- The rule ""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"" forces the next state to be either event2 or event3.
- C1 is the statement ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens."" To evaluate C1 in the next state, check whether event1 holds in that next state. In both possible next states (event2 or event3), event1 does not occur, so the implication ""if event1 then event4"" is vacuously true.
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret rules
- Initial: event2 happens.
- Transitions:
  - after 1 → {2,5}
  - after 2 → {1,3,4}
  - after 3 → {5}
  - after 4 → {1,2,3}
  - after 5 → {1,2,3}

C1 says: event5 happens AND event3 happens.
C2 says: if event4 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., whenever event4 occurs, both event3 and event5 must occur).

Step 2 — find a counterexample sequence
Start at the initial event2, then take:
2 → 4 (so event4 happens),
4 → 1,
1 → 2,
2 → 4,
and repeat the cycle 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 forever.

In this valid sequence event4 does happen, but neither event3 nor event5 ever need occur (we can always choose 1 or 4 or 2 to remain in the cycle). Thus C1 fails in a run where event4 occurs.

Conclusion
Because there exists a valid sequence where event4 happens but C1 does not, C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Transitions given: 4 -> {1,2,3}, 1 -> {2,5}, 2 -> {1,3,4}, 3 -> {5}, 5 -> {1,2,3}. Initial event2 occurs.
- To refute ""If event4 happens then (event5 and event3 happen)"", it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence where event4 occurs but either event3 or event5 never occurs.
- Example valid infinite sequence: 2 (initial) -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... 
  - Each step respects the allowed ""after"" choices (2 -> 4 allowed, 4 -> 1 allowed, 1 -> 2 allowed).
  - This sequence contains event4 but never contains event3 or event5.
- Therefore event4 does not guarantee that event5 and event3 will happen, so C2 is False.
---
We must decide whether ""If event4 happens, then (event5 happens and event3 happens)"" is guaranteed by the rules.

Rules (condensed):
- Initially event2 happened.
- 4 -> one of {1,2,3}
- 1 -> one of {2,5}
- 2 -> one of {1,3,4}
- 3 -> 5
- 5 -> one of {1,2,3}

We need the implication to hold for every possible allowed sequence in which event4 occurs. To disprove it it suffices to give one valid sequence where 4 occurs but either 3 or 5 never occurs.

Counterexample sequence (all steps follow the rules):
- Start: event2 (given).
- From 2 choose 4 (allowed): event4 happens.
- From 4 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2 choose 4 (allowed).
Repeat the cycle 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 indefinitely.

In this infinite valid execution event4 does occur, yet neither event3 nor event5 ever occurs. Thus ""if event4 happens then (event5 and event3 happen)"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event3 happened.
- From the rule ""After event3, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen,"" the next state must be one of: event1, event2, or event5.
- Check each possibility:
  - If the next state is event2, then event2 has happened already, so ""event2 eventually happens"" holds in that next state.
  - If the next state is event1, the rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur next, so event2 eventually happens.
  - If the next state is event5, the rule ""After event5, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur next, so event2 eventually happens.
- In every possible next state, event2 is guaranteed to occur eventually. Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True or False.

Identify the hypotheses
- C1: Event2 eventually happens (from the current state).
- C2: In the next state (i.e., after one event occurs), C1 is true (from that next state, event2 eventually happens).

Given facts (starting point: initially event3 happened)
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event5} must happen next.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event5, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (but event2 has occurred).
- After event4, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen (irrelevant here because event4 cannot follow event3).

Trace the possible next states (immediately after the initial event3):
- If the next event is event2: event2 has already occurred in that next state → C1 (event2 eventually happens) is true there.
- If the next event is event1: the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees event2 will occur later → C1 is true in that next state.
- If the next event is event5: the rule ""after event5, event2 must happen"" guarantees event2 will occur later → C1 is true in that next state.

In every possible next state (the only allowed successors of the initial state), event2 is guaranteed either immediately or eventually. Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

Answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. From event3 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- If the next event is event2, then event2 has occurred (so ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied).
- If the next event is event1, then by the rule after event1, event2 must happen.
- If the next event is event5, then by the rule after event5, event2 must happen.

In every possible next-state case, event2 will (either immediately or subsequently) occur. Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") holds in the next state, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- From the context we have the allowed immediate next events:
  - 1 -> {2,3}
  - 2 -> {4,5}
  - 3 -> {2,4,5}
  - 4 -> {1,2,5}
  - 5 -> {1,2}
  - initial event: 4

- C1 says: whenever event4 happens, event3 happens (at some later point). We assume C1 holds and ask whether that forces event2 to occur (C2).

- Construct a path that satisfies the context and C1 but never contains event2:
  4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...
  - Each step is allowed by the transition rules (4->1, 1->3, 3->4).
  - Event3 occurs after every occurrence of event4 (so C1 is satisfied).
  - Event2 never occurs on this path.

Because such a valid execution exists, C1 does not imply that event2 must happen. Therefore C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state).

Step 2 — Use the given transitions:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be either event3 or event4.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 in the next state:
- The next state events are {event3, event4}; neither is event2, so ""Event2 does not happen"" is true in the next state.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, Event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be either event3 or event4 (no option for event2).

Step 3 — trace the immediate next state:
- Because after event5 the next event is either 3 or 4, the next state does not contain event2.

Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state, event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the initial/current state:
- Initially event5 happened → so in the current state event2 did not happen. Thus C1 is true now.

Step 3 — examine the next state:
- After event5, the next event must be either event3 or event4. In either case, the next state’s event is not event2. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") also holds in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- Initially event4 happened. The rules say: after event4, event3 must happen. So the immediate next event cannot be event5 — C1 (event5 in the next state) is inconsistent with the given rules.
- Even ignoring that inconsistency and assuming hypothetically that C1 holds (that event5 happens), the rules after event5 allow either event3 or event4 next. From event3 the next can be event2, event4, or event5 — event2 is possible but not forced; from event4 the next must be event3, which again does not force event2. So event2 does not necessarily follow from event5.
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the rules: after event5, either event3 or event4 must happen. There is no rule forcing event2 after event5.
- A concrete trace showing C1 true but event2 not happening: initially event4 → (must) event3 → choose event5 (so C1 holds). After event5 we can choose event4 (allowed), and event2 need not occur.
- Therefore ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is not entailed.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- We have transitions: after 4 -> 3; after 3 -> one of {2,4,5}; after 5 -> one of {3,4}; after 2 -> one of {4,5}; (and initial event4).
- C1 says event5 occurs in the next state. We ask: does that force event2 to happen later?
- Counterexample trace: start with initial 4 -> (must) 3 -> (choose) 5. So C1 holds (event5 happened).
  After that, choose 4 (allowed after 5). Then 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 ... can repeat forever by always choosing 4 after 3.
- In this trace event2 never occurs. Therefore ""if event5 happens then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event2 always happens."" C2 = ""C1 always holds."" So C2 claims that in every possible execution C1 is true (i.e., event2 happens in every execution).

- From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That fixes event2 as having occurred in every execution's initial state. Also ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So every execution contains event2 (at the start) and then terminates; no alternative initial event or branch omits event2.

- The other rules (what can follow event1, event3, event4, event5) are irrelevant because no events can follow event2 and event2 happens initially.

- Therefore C1 is true in all executions, so C2 (which asserts that C1 always holds) is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., the statement C1 is true in the given scenario)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" — event2 is a fact at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — once event2 has happened the run ends; no further events can occur.
- The other rules (what must happen after event1, event3, event4, event5) are irrelevant because they only apply if those events occur, but they cannot occur after event2 and there is no rule forcing them to occur before event2.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- In the only permitted sequence consistent with the given facts, event2 has occurred (initially) and no other events occur afterward.
- Therefore event2 does happen in every allowed run of the system; C1 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Since C1 is true under the given conditions, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., it asserts that C1 is true)

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (fact)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (so the trace stops at event2)
- The other ""after"" rules (about events 1,3,4,5) are irrelevant because no events can occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- There is a single (initial) event: event2 happened.
- Because no other events can happen afterwards, every execution/trace contains event2 (the initial event) and nothing else.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true given the stated initial fact and the impossibility of any other events.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds; since C1 is true under the given conditions, C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event5 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- The context states ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 is true.
- C1 is the implication event2 → event2, which is a logical tautology (always true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs).

Step 3 — combine:
- Both conjuncts of C2 are true (event5 is true; C1 is true), so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event5 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That is a tautological implication (p → p), which is always true. So C1 holds.

Step 3 — examine event5
- The context states ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 does happen.

Step 4 — combine
- C2 requires event5 to happen (true) and C1 to hold (true). Both conditions are satisfied.

Final answer: True

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- The rule after event1: either event2, event3, or event4 must happen next.
- Event5 is not among the allowed events after event1, so Event5 cannot happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Step 1 — what's being asked:
- C1 asserts: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event5 does not happen in the next state).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next state must be one of: event2, event3, or event4. (Event5 is not listed as an option after event1.)

Step 3 — conclude about the next state:
- From the initial event1, the immediate next state cannot be event5 (only event2, event3, or event4 are possible). Thus C1 is false.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
We start from: initially event1 happened. The rule ""After event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen"" means the next state must be one of {event2, event3, event4}. Event5 is not among the allowed next events. Therefore C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- The rule ""After event1, either event3 or event5 must happen"" fixes the next state to be either event3 or event5.
- C1 asserts ""event2 happens in the next state"" — this is false because the next state cannot be event2 (it must be event3 or event5).
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds or event1 happens (in the next state)"". Since C1 is false and the next state is not event1 (it's event3 or event5), C2 is also false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened. The rule ""After event1, either event3 or event5 must happen"" means the immediate next event must be event3 or event5.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- Also event1 cannot happen in the next state (only event3 or event5 are allowed), so the disjunction C1 or event1 is false.
Hence C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (i.e., ""Event2 happens next OR Event1 happens next"").

Step 2 — use the context (initial condition and transition rules):
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event3 or event5 must happen"" applies to the very next state.

Step 3 — evaluate the disjuncts of C2 for the next state:
- From the rule, the next state must be event3 or event5, so event2 does not necessarily happen next (C1 is not guaranteed).
- Also, event1 cannot happen next (only event3 or event5 are allowed), so the second disjunct is false as well.

Conclusion:
- Neither disjunct of C2 is guaranteed after the initial event1, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That is, starting from the initial situation (event5 happened), is it guaranteed that at some future point event2 or event3 will occur?

Step 2 — examine the rules (transitions)
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- After event1 → one of {event3, event4}.
- After event4 → event3 (forced).
- After event3 → one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4}.

Step 3 — reason about all possible futures from the initial event5
- From the initial event5, the next event must be either 1, 2, or 3.
  - If it is 2 or 3, C1 holds immediately.
  - If it is 1, the next must be 3 or 4.
    - If 3 occurs, C1 holds.
    - If 4 occurs, the next (forced) event is 3, so C1 holds then.

There is no possible sequence starting from event5 that avoids ever reaching event2 or event3.

Conclusion
- C1 is inevitably reached from the initial state, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C1 is the proposition ""event2 happens or event3 happens"". C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point, event2 or event3 will occur). We must decide whether C2 is true given the rules and the initial event5.

Step 2 — examine the transitions from the initial event5:
After event5 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.

- If the next event is event2, then C1 holds immediately.
- If the next event is event3, then C1 holds immediately.
- If the next event is event1, then by the rule after event1 either event3 or event4 must happen.
  - If event3 happens then C1 holds.
  - If event4 happens then, since after event4 event3 must happen, event3 will happen next, so C1 holds.

Thus in every possible branch starting from the initial event5, either event2 or event3 occurs (immediately or after at most two steps).

Conclusion: C1 eventually holds on all possible futures, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurs. After event5, the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3}.
- If the next event is event2 or event3, then C1 (event2 or event3) holds immediately.
- If the next event is event1, then after event1 the next event must be event3 or event4.
  - If it is event3, C1 holds.
  - If it is event4, then after event4 event3 must happen, so C1 holds.
- Thus in every possible continuation from the initial event5, event3 (hence event2 or event3) will occur within at most two steps. Therefore C1 eventually holds, so C2 is True."

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning summary:
- Transitions: 1->{2,4,5}, 2->{3,5}, 3->{1,4,5}, 4->{1,3}, 5->{1,2}. Initial state is 1.
- Interpret C1 as the property ""event3 never happens (from that point onward)"". C2 says this property eventually holds (there is a time after which no event3 occurs).
- From the initial event1 we can choose transitions 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> ... forever. This infinite cycle uses only events 1 and 4 and never visits event3.
- Hence there is a valid trace where event3 never happens (so C1 holds immediately and forever), so C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is true.

False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- From the rules we have transitions: 1→{2,4,5}, 2→{3,5}, 3→{1,4,5}, 4→{1,3}, 5→{1,2}.
- C1 asserts ""event3 does not happen (ever)"". C2 asserts ""event3 eventually never happens"" (there is a time after which 3 never occurs).
- To show C2 is false it suffices to exhibit a valid infinite execution in which 3 occurs infinitely often (so there is no suffix without 3). For example:
  1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 3 → ...
  Each step respects the allowed transitions (1→4, 4→3, 3→1). This run contains event3 infinitely often, so there is no point after which event3 never happens.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed and is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" — i.e., from some point on we see no occurrences of event3.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is a point in time after which event3 never occurs (equivalently, eventually we stay in a behavior with no event3).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules (allowed next events)
- From event1 → {event2, event4, event5}
- From event4 → {event1, event3}
- From event3 → {event1, event4, event5}
- From event2 → {event3, event5}
- From event5 → {event1, event2}

Initial event is event1.

Step 3 — find a run that avoids event3 forever
- Start at the initial event1.
- Choose event4 next (allowed: event1 → event4).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed: event4 → event1).
- Repeat e1 → e4 → e1 → e4 → ... forever.

This infinite run contains no event3 at any step, so C1 holds immediately and therefore C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is satisfied.

Conclusion
- C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event3, or event4 must happen"" means the immediate next event after the initial event1 is either event3 or event4.
- Event2 is not an allowed immediate successor of event1, so ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen (so the immediate next state after the initial event1 is either event3 or event4).
- The other rules constrain later steps but do not allow event2 immediately after event1:
  - After event3, event1 must happen (so 1 → 3 → 1).
  - After event4, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen (so if you pick 4 as the next state, event2 could only occur one step later, not immediately).
  - After event2 no other events can happen (terminal).
  - After event5, event4 must happen.
  - After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — Reason about the next state:
- Since the next state after the initial event1 must be event3 or event4, event2 cannot be the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does NOT happen in the next state).

Step 2 — apply the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event3 or event4 must happen"" constrains the immediate next state: it must be event3 or event4.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur in the immediate next state (it could occur later only if a path allows it, e.g. event1 → event4 → event2).

Step 3 — conclusion:
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when event5 is not forced to occur at every step.

Step 2 — list the transition rules (distinct ones):
- Initially event5 happens.
- After 1 → {2, 3, 4, 5}
- After 2 → {1, 3}
- After 3 → {1, 4, 5}
- After 4 → {1, 2, 3, 5}
- After 5 → {1, 4}

Step 3 — find a permitted sequence that violates ""event5 always happens"":
- Start: 5 (given).
- From 5 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2 choose 1 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 ... forever.

This infinite sequence contains 5 only at the initial step and thereafter never visits event5. Thus event5 does not occur at every step, so C1 is false.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/event in the allowed execution).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (the negation of C1).

We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules (transitions):
- Initially: event5 happened.
- After event5: next must be event1 or event4.
- After event1: next must be event2, event3, event4, or event5.
- After event2: next must be event1 or event3.
- After event3: next must be event1, event4, or event5.
- After event4: next must be event1, event2, event3, or event5.
(Other repetitions in the statement repeat these same constraints.)

Step 3 — find a reachable execution that violates ""event5 always happens"":
- Start: event5 (given).
- From event5 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed).
Thus we can loop 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 … indefinitely, never producing event5 after the initial step.

Because such an execution exists, event5 does not have to occur at every step. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happened.
- The rules state: ""After event5, either event1 or event4 must happen."" That means the event immediately following any occurrence of event5 cannot be event5.
- Therefore there is at least one step (the step after the initial event5) where event5 does not happen. Hence event5 does not happen at every step, so ""Event5 always happens"" (C1) is false.

Sample responses:

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event4 happens.
- The rule ""after event4, either event1, event3, or event5 must happen"" allows event1 as the next event.
- The rule ""after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen"" allows event4 as the next event.
- So we can have the sequence 4 → 1 → 4 → 1 → ... forever, never choosing event5.
- That provides a valid execution where event4 occurs but event5 never does, so the implication ""if event4 happens, then event5 happens"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 asserts: whenever event4 happens, event5 happens. To disprove C1 it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence (consistent with the given ""after"" rules) in which event4 occurs but event5 never occurs.

- From the context the allowed transitions are:
  - 1 -> {3, 4}
  - 3 -> {1, 4, 5}
  - 4 -> {1, 3, 5}
  - 5 -> {1, 3, 4}
  - 2 -> {1, 3, 5}
  - Initial event: 4

- Construct a counterexample: start at the initial event4, then go to event1 (allowed: 4 -> 1), then go back to event4 (allowed: 1 -> 4). Repeat this 4 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 ... forever. This infinite valid sequence contains event4 but never contains event5.

- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Reasoning:

- C1 says: whenever event4 happens, event5 happens (i.e., event5 inevitably occurs after event4).
- From the rules: from event4 the next event can be 1, 3, or 5. From 1 the next can be 3 or 4. From 3 the next can be 1, 4, or 5. Thus there is a cycle among {1,3,4} that can always avoid choosing 5.
- Starting with the initial event4, a valid infinite sequence that never produces event5 is, for example: 4 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (always choose the non-5 options). Therefore event5 is not guaranteed after event4.
- Hence C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Start: event2 happens. After event2, event1 must happen. So we have event2 → event1.
- From event1 we can choose event4. So one possible continuation is event2 → event1 → event4.
- After event4, we may choose event1 (the rule is “either event1 or event5”). So take event4 → event1.
- From that event1 we can choose event2, and then back to event1 (since event2 must be followed by event1). This yields a cycle: ... → event1 → event2 → event1 → event4 → event1 → ...
- This infinite sequence contains event4 but never contains event5 (we always avoid choosing event5). Thus there exists a valid execution where event4 occurs and event5 never occurs.

Therefore C2 (""If event4 happens, then event5 always happens"") is False. Final answer:
False
---
First identify the claim: C2 says ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event5 always happens."" So C2 asserts that whenever event4 occurs, event5 must occur (in every resulting allowed sequence).

List the rules (from the context):
- Initially: event2.
- 2 → 1 (after event2, event1 must happen).
- 1 → {2, 3, 4}.
- 3 is terminal (after event3 no other events can happen).
- 4 → {1, 5}.
- 5 → {1, 3}.

Find a counterexample trace where 4 happens but 5 never happens:
- Start: 2 (initial).
- 2 → 1 (forced): sequence 2,1.
- From 1 choose 4: sequence 2,1,4 (4 has happened).
- From 4 choose 1: sequence 2,1,4,1.
- From 1 choose 3: sequence 2,1,4,1,3. Now 3 is terminal, sequence ends.

This trace contains event4 but never contains event5. Therefore event4 can happen without forcing event5 to always happen. So C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis asks whether C2 (""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"") is true. C1 says ""Event5 always happens.""
- Start condition and rules:
  - Initially event2 happens.
  - 2 -> 1 (event2 must be followed by event1).
  - 1 -> {2, 3, 4}.
  - 3 -> terminal (no further events).
  - 4 -> {1, 5}.
  - 5 -> {1, 3}.
- To refute C2 it suffices to find a valid sequence where event4 occurs but event5 does not always happen (in particular, a sequence containing 4 that never contains 5).
- Construct a valid sequence: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3.
  - 2->1 is required.
  - 1->4 is allowed.
  - 4->1 is allowed.
  - 1->3 is allowed; 3 is terminal.
  - This sequence contains event4 but contains no event5.
- Therefore event4 can occur in a run that does not contain event5, so ""If event4 happens, then event5 always happens"" is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
The hypothesis C2 says: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event5 must occur in the next state.

Examine the rules and trace a possible sequence starting from the initial event5:
- Initially event5.
- After event5, event4 must happen → sequence: 5 → 4.
- After event4, event2, event3, or event5 may happen. Choose event2 → 5 → 4 → 2.
- After event2, event1 or event3 may happen. Choose event1 → 5 → 4 → 2 → 1.
- After event1, one of {2,3,4,5} must happen. We can choose event2 (which is allowed), so the next state after event1 is event2, not event5.

This provides a valid counterexample where event1 occurs but the next state is not event5. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
We ask whether ""If event1 happens, then event5 happens in the next state"" is entailed by the rules.

Relevant rules:
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4, event5} must happen (so event5 is allowed but not required).
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event4, one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3} must happen.
- After event3, one of {event4, event5} must happen.

A counterexample sequence consistent with the rules:
- Initially event5.
- After event5 → event4 (must).
- After event4 → event2 (allowed).
- After event2 → event1 (allowed).
- After event1 → event2 (allowed).

Here event1 occurs but the next state is event2 (not event5), so C1 (event5 in the next state) is false in this case. That makes the implication C2 false.

Answer: False
---
Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event5 happened. After event5, event4 must happen. So the immediate next event after the initial state is event4. Therefore C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false in the initial step.

- C2 states: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. whenever event1 occurs, the next event must be event5. We need to check whether the rules force that.

- The rules after event1 allow event2, event3, event4, or event5 — event5 is only one of several possible successors, not forced.

- A concrete reachable counterexample sequence:
  initial: event5
  -> (after event5 must) event4
  -> (choose after event4) event2
  -> (choose after event2) event1
  -> (choose after event1) event2
  This sequence respects all given rules, and here event1 is followed by event2, not event5. So C1 does not necessarily hold after event1.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3, either event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- If event5 happens, the rule ""after event5, event2 must happen"" gives event2.
- If event4 happens, the rule ""after event4, event5 must happen"" gives event5, and then ""after event5, event2 must happen"" gives event2.
- Therefore in either case (event4 or event5), event2 must happen, so the implication ""If (event4 or event5) then event2"" is true.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3: one of event2, event4, or event5 must happen next.
- If event5 happens (branch 1): the rule ""after event5, event2 must happen"" forces event2.
- If event4 happens (branch 2): the rule ""after event4, event5 must happen"" forces event5, and then ""after event5, event2 must happen"" forces event2.
- Thus in every possible case where ""event4 or event5 happens"" holds, event2 will follow.

Therefore C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is True.
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event4 happens or event5 happens"" (4 ∨ 5).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — i.e. (4 ∨ 5) → 2.
We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the given rules starting from the initial event3.

Examine the rules (read ""A -> B"" as ""after A, B must happen""):
- 5 -> 2
- 2 -> (1 ∨ 3 ∨ 5)
- 1 -> (4 ∨ 5)
- 3 -> (2 ∨ 4 ∨ 5)
- 4 -> 5

Trace consequences when 4 or 5 occurs:
- If 5 occurs, rule 5 -> 2 forces event2 to happen.
- If 4 occurs, rule 4 -> 5 forces event5, and then 5 -> 2 forces event2. So 4 also inevitably leads to 2.

Thus in every case where (4 ∨ 5) holds, event2 must follow. Therefore C2 is True.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1 says: whenever event2 happens, event1 happens (a universal implication).
- C2 says: C1 does not hold (i.e., C1 is false).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Key rules from the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Look for a counterexample to C1
To refute C1 we need a possible sequence where event2 occurs but event1 never occurs afterward.
- Start: event2 -> (rule) event5.
- Choose event5 -> event3.
- From event3 choose event2 (allowed).
Now we have event2 again, so event5 must follow, and we can repeat the same choices: event5 -> event3 -> event2 -> ...
This produces an infinite run that never reaches event1. Alternatively, from event5 one could choose event4 and then choose event5 again, looping between 4 and 5 and avoiding event1. So there are valid continuations from event2 that never lead to event1.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- Because there exists at least one valid sequence starting from event2 in which event1 never happens, C1 (the universal implication ""if event2 then event1"") does not hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""

From the context, transitions are:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event3, either event1, event2, or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Counterexample showing C1 can fail:
Start with event2 (given) → event5 (forced) → choose event3 (allowed) → choose event2 (allowed). This returns to event2 and can repeat forever: 2 → 5 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 3 → ...
In this execution, event1 never occurs. Thus event2 does not guarantee that event1 happens, so C1 is false.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True. 

True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happens, and after event2 event5 must happen. So we have event2 → event5.
- After event5 either event3 or event4 must happen.
- Choose event3. After event3 one allowed option is event2. So we can continue: event2 → event5 → event3 → event2 ...
- This yields a valid (infinite) sequence that keeps returning to event2 without ever choosing event1.
- Because the rules allow choices that avoid event1 indefinitely, there exists a valid execution where event2 occurs and event1 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") does not hold, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" (i.e., from the current state, event4 occurs in the immediate successor)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the immediate successor state, C1 is true — so event4 would have to occur in that successor's successor)

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event4 must happen → so in the next state (immediate successor) event4 occurs. Therefore C1 is true at the initial state.
- After event4, no other events can happen → once event4 occurs (in the next state), there is no further state in which any event (including event4) can occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires that in the next state, C1 is true, i.e. that event4 occurs in that state's next state.
- But because event4 is terminal (no further events after it), there is no next state after the state where event4 occurs, so event4 cannot occur again there.
- Therefore C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — parse the claims
- C1 = ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e. X event4).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = ""in the next state, event4 happens in the next state"" = X X event4 (event4 two steps ahead).

Step 2 — use the given constraints (interpreting ""After ..."" as the immediate next-state requirement)
- Initially event1 happened now.
- ""After event1, event4 must happen"" ⇒ from event1 the next state must be event4. So C1 is True at the initial state.
- ""After event4, no other events can happen"" ⇒ when at event4 there is no next state with any event (so there cannot be a next-state event4).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires that at the next state (which is event4) C1 holds, i.e. that event4 occurs in the following state. But after event4 no events can happen, so event4 cannot occur in the next state. Thus C1 is false at that next state, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We want to evaluate C2, which says ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is ""Event4 happens in the next state."" So C2 is ""in the next state, Event4 happens in that next state's next state"" (i.e. Next Next Event4).

Trace from the given facts:
- Initially event1 happened (state0).
- After event1, event4 must happen → state1 has event4. So C1 (""Event4 happens in the next state"") is true at state0.
- After event4, no other events can happen → from state1 there is no next event (no state2 with an event), so ""Event4 happens in the next state"" is false when evaluated at state1.

Therefore C2 (Next Next Event4) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" is true, where C1 is ""Event3 always happens.""

First note C1 is false: starting from initial event5, there are possible sequences that never include event3 (for example 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → …).

To test C2, find a sequence in which event4 occurs but event3 never happens. From the initial 5 we can go 5 → 4. From 4 we can go to 1, and from 1 to 5, so the cycle 5 → 4 → 1 → 5 → 4 → 1 … is allowed by the rules and never includes event3. Thus event4 can occur without guaranteeing that event3 will always happen.

Therefore C2 is False. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify rules and start:
- Initially event5.
- Transitions: 1->{2,3,4,5}, 2->{1,3,5}, 3->{1,2,5}, 4->{1,2,3}, 5->{1,2,4}.

Step 2 — interpret C2:
C2 says: ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every continuation/event sequence, event3 will occur).

Step 3 — find a counterexample:
From 4 you can go to 1. From 1 go to 2. From 2 go back to 1. The cycle 1↔2 is allowed (1->2 and 2->1) and avoids event3. So starting from the initial 5 you can do 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... forever without ever seeing event3.

Conclusion:
Because there is a valid continuation after event4 that never produces event3, C2 is false.

False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happens. From the rules, after event5 one allowed next event is event4, so event4 can occur (e.g. take 5 → 4).
- After event4 the allowed next events are {1,2,3}. To show the implication fails, exhibit a valid execution where event4 occurs but event3 does not always happen. Choose 4 → 1 (allowed), then 1 → 2 (allowed), then 2 → 1 (allowed), and repeat 1 ↔ 2 forever. This gives a valid infinite sequence:
  5, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
  which respects all ""after"" rules and contains no event3.
- In that sequence event4 did happen but C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false. Therefore the implication ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds"" is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 says ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 says ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. ""if event1 occurs then event1 eventually occurs.""
- That implication is trivially true: whenever event1 occurs at some time, it is true that event1 eventually occurs (it already occurred).
- (For completeness: from the initial event5 there is a possible path event5 → event4 → event1, so C1 is achievable; but C2 does not depend on that — it's a tautological implication.)
---
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In other words, (event1 happens) ⇒ (event1 eventually happens).

Step 2 — interpret ""eventually""
- ""Eventually"" means that at some time (now or in the future) the event occurs. If an event happens at some time, then it has indeed happened at some time — so it satisfies ""eventually.""

Step 3 — evaluate the implication
- If event1 happens (at some time), then by that occurrence, event1 has happened at some time, so C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true.
- Therefore the implication in C2 is always true whenever its antecedent is true. There is no need to use the given sequence constraints; the implication is logically valid by the meaning of ""eventually.""

Final answer:
True
---
C1 is ""event1 eventually happens"" (there exists some point in the execution where event1 occurs).
C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event1 occurs at some time, then there exists some time where event1 occurs.

That implication is trivially true: if event1 occurs then, by definition, there is a time at which event1 occurs, so ""event1 eventually happens"" holds. The transition rules/context are irrelevant to this logical implication.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 occurred.
- From event5 the rules allow either event1 or event2. Choose event1 (this is allowed).
- From event1 the rules allow either event3 or event5. Choose event5.
- From event5 again choose event1, and repeat the 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 … loop forever.
- This infinite execution contains only events 5 and 1 and never contains event2. So ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) holds (indeed from the first choice onward), and therefore C1 eventually holds.
- Hence C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event5 happens, then event3 happens.""
- Hypothesis C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (i.e. C1 ∨ event1).
- From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true.
- Therefore the disjunction C1 ∨ event1 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
(For completeness: C1 itself is not guaranteed by the rules, since after event5 either event3 or event4 may happen, so event3 is not forced.)

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event5 happens, then event3 happens (event5 → event3).
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens ( (event5 → event3) ∨ event1 ).

Step 2 — use the given facts:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means event1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: (C1) ∨ (event1). Since event1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: (Event2 happens) OR (Event1 happens).
- C2: (Event3 happens) OR (C1 holds).
We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, Event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Since Event1 happened, C1 is true (the disjunction is satisfied).
- C2 is a disjunction with C1 as one disjunct; because C1 is true, C2 is true regardless of whether Event3 occurs.

(Alternatively, check by branching: after Event1 either Event2 (which makes C1 true) or Event4→Event3 (which makes Event3 true); in every possible branch C2 holds.)

True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens or Event1 happens.
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially, Event1 happened. Therefore Event1 happens is true, so C1 is true (Event2 or Event1).
- Since C1 is true, C2 = (Event3 or C1) is true regardless of whether Event3 occurs.

(As a check: from the initial Event1, the possible continuations are Event2 (which makes C1 true) or Event4→Event3 (which makes Event3 true). Either way C2 would hold.)

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event2 happens or Event1 happens (Event2 ∨ Event1).
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds (Event3 ∨ C1), which is equivalent to Event3 ∨ Event2 ∨ Event1.

Step 2 — examine initial condition
- The context states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Since Event1 is true, C1 (Event2 ∨ Event1) is true.
- Therefore C2 (Event3 ∨ C1) is also true (because C1 is true, the disjunction holds regardless of Event3).

From the rules: initially event2 occurred, and after event2 the next event must be either event3 or event5. Neither of those is event1, so in every possible immediate next state event1 does not occur. Therefore C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (no time specified)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" i.e. in the immediate next state, Event1 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event3 or event5 must happen next.
- (Other rules: after event3 → event4 → event1 later, after event5 → no further events. Those affect later states but not immediately.)

Step 3 — trace the possible next states
- If the next event is event3, then in that next state event3 happened and event1 did not happen.
- If the next event is event5, then in that next state event5 happened and event1 did not happen.

In both permitted next states, Event1 does not happen.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.

- After event5, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules: after event3 → event4 must happen, after event4 → event1 must happen, after event1 → event2 or event3 or event5.)

Step 3 — trace possible next states:
- From the initial state (event2), the next state can only be event3 or event5.
- In neither of those cases is event1 the immediate next event.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The hypothesis C1 is the state formula ""if event4 happens, then event5 happens"" (event4 -> event5).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (one step after the initial state).
- Initially event4 happened. The rules require that after event4 the next event must be either event1 or event2.
- Therefore in the next state the actual event is event1 or event2, so event4 does not happen in that state.
- A conditional ""if event4 then event5"" is true whenever the antecedent (event4) is false. Hence C1 is true in the next state.
- So C2 is True.
---
Reasoning:
- C1 is the state-property ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens"" (i.e. event4 ⇒ event5 in a given state).
- Initially event4 happened. After event4, the system must move to a next state where either event1 or event2 happens.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in that next state.
- In the next state either event1 or event2 holds, so event4 does not hold there. An implication ""event4 ⇒ event5"" is therefore vacuously true when event4 is false.

Conclusion: True
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says: whenever event4 happens, event5 happens (i.e. event5 must follow event4).
- But the rules state: after event4, either event1 or event2 must happen — event5 is not required.
- Initially event4 happened, and the next event can be event1 (or event2). That is a concrete counterexample to C1.
- C2 claims C1 holds in the next state; since C1 is already false (event4 can be followed by event1), C2 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event5 happened.
- Under C1 we assume event5 always happens (so event5 must keep occurring).
- From event5 the allowed next events are event1 or event4. To avoid event4, choose event1.
- From event1 the allowed next events are event3 or event4. To avoid event4, choose event3.
- From event3 the allowed next events are event1, event2, or event4. To avoid event4 choose event2.
- From event2 the allowed next events are event3 or event5. Choose event5 to satisfy C1.

This yields a valid cycle 5 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 5 ... in which event5 occurs repeatedly (so C1 holds) and event4 never occurs. Thus C1 does not imply event4 happens, so C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis asks whether ""If C1 holds (Event5 always happens) then event4 happens."" We must check if, under the given transition rules, C1 implies that event4 must occur at some point.

- Relevant rules (summarized):
  - Initially event5 happened.
  - After event5 → either event1 or event4.
  - After event1 → either event3 or event4.
  - After event3 → either event1, event2, or event4.
  - After event2 → either event3 or event5.
  - After event4 → either event1, event2, or event5.

- To refute the implication, it is enough to exhibit a valid infinite sequence consistent with the rules in which event5 ""always happens"" (i.e., continues to occur) but event4 never occurs.

- Construct a cycle that avoids event4:
  - Start: event5 (given).
  - Choose event1 after event5 (allowed).
  - Choose event3 after event1 (allowed).
  - Choose event2 after event3 (allowed).
  - Choose event5 after event2 (allowed).
  - Repeat this cycle: ... → event5 → event1 → event3 → event2 → event5 → ...
  This sequence respects all transition constraints and never includes event4, while event5 recurs indefinitely.

- Therefore, even if event5 always happens (e.g., recurs forever), event4 is not forced to occur. The implication ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: Event3 happens in the next state.
- C2: If event4 happens, then C1 holds (i.e. if event4 happens, then event3 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — extract the transition rules relevant to the next state
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- After event4, the next event must be one of {event2, event3}.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- From initial event5, the next state could be event2, event3, or event4. So C1 (that event3 definitely happens in the next state) is not guaranteed.
- For C2: suppose event4 happens. The rule “after event4” allows the following state to be either event2 or event3. So event3 is not guaranteed after event4 (it might be event2). Therefore the implication “if event4 happens, then event3 happens next” is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event5 happened. From the rules, after event5 the next event must be one of {2, 3, 4}.
- C1 claims “event3 happens in the next state.” That is not guaranteed (from event5 the next could be 2 or 4), so C1 need not hold.
- C2 says “if event4 happens, then C1 holds” — interpreting this as: whenever event4 occurs, the next state must be event3. But the rule for event4 is that after event4 the next event is either 2 or 3. So after event4, event3 is possible but not guaranteed (it could be event2).
- Concrete counterexample: initial event5 → event4 (allowed) → event2 (allowed). Here event4 happens but the following state is event2, so event3 does not occur next; C2 fails.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happened, so the next state must be one of {event2, event3, event4}.
- C1 claims ""event3 happens in the next state"" — that is not guaranteed (next could be event2 or event4).
- C2 says ""if event4 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if the next state is event4 then the next state is event3. That is impossible: the next state cannot be both event4 and event3.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens."" This is the formula p → p with p = ""event5 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is true in every reachable situation given the transition rules.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- The context lists allowed successor events after each event, but nothing in those rules changes the logical form of C1.
- C1 is a logical tautology (p → p). A statement of the form ""if p then p"" is true in every state/point regardless of whether p actually holds there.

Step 3 — Reasoning about sequences
- Even if event5 never occurs or occurs many times along sequences, the implication ""if event5 happens then event5 happens"" is always true (it is true when p is true, and also true when p is false).
- Therefore C1 holds at every state reachable under the given transition rules.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens."" (i.e. event5 → event5)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — logical analysis of C1:
- The implication p → p is a logical tautology: it is true whenever p is true (then p is true) and also true when p is false (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- Therefore C1 is true in every possible scenario, regardless of the transition rules given.

Step 3 — conclusion about C2:
- Since C1 is always true, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the statement ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens"" (formally: event5 → event5).
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in all situations).

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula P → P is a tautology in propositional logic: it is true for every truth value of P.
- Even if event5 never happens, the implication is still true (vacuous truth).

Step 3 — relation to the system
- The given event-transition rules do not affect the logical status of P → P. No matter what sequences are possible, P → P is always true.

Conclusion
- C1 is always true, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's asked:
- C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event4 never happens).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules and the starting point:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event4 → either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event5 → event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace reachable events from the start:
- From initial event3, the system can only go to event1 or event2.
- From event1 it can only go to event2 or event3.
- From event2 it must go to event1.
Thus the reachable set starting from event3 is {1,2,3} and the system cycles among events 1, 2, and 3.

Step 4 — can event4 ever be reached?
- The only rules involving event4 are ""after event4 → {2,3,5}"" and ""after event5 → 4"". Both directions require event4 or event5 already to occur.
- There is no rule that leads from any of {1,2,3} to event4 or event5.
Therefore event4 (and event5) are unreachable from the initial event3.

Conclusion:
- Event4 does not eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""Event4 never happens"") is true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the only possible next events are event1 or event2.
- From event1 the only possible next events are event2 or event3.
- From event2 the only possible next event is event1.
- So starting from event3 the system is confined to the set {event1, event2, event3} and cycles among those; no rule produces event4 or event5 from any of 1,2,3.
- The only way to get event4 is after event5, and the only way to get event5 is after event4, so {event4, event5} form an isolated loop unreachable from {1,2,3}.

Therefore event4 cannot eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 is true.

True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 occurs.
- From event3 the rules force the next event to be either event1 or event2.
- From event1 the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- From event2 the next event must be event1.
- Therefore once started at event3 the system is confined to the set {event1, event2, event3} and can only cycle among those three.
- There is no rule that allows a transition from {1,2,3} to event4 or event5. Event5 leads to event4 and event4 leads to {2,3,5}, but neither 4 nor 5 can be reached from the initial component.
- Hence event4 never occurs (C1 is false), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True."

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 occurs. From ""After event3, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur.
- From event1, one of {event2, event3, event5} must follow. It is allowed to choose event2.
- If event2 occurs, then from ""After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen"" it is possible for event4 to occur.
- Thus there exists a valid sequence (event3 → event1 → event2 → event4) in which event4 happens, so C1 (event4 happens) can be true.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event4 does not happen). That is not guaranteed by the rules, so C2 is not true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event4 happens."" This just means Event4 happens.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 asserts that Event4 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions (rules):
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen.
- After event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.
- After event4, event2 must happen.
- After event5, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s):
- Start: event3 (given).
- Then event1 must happen (rule after event3).
- From event1 choose event2 (allowed).
- From event2 choose event4 (one of the allowed outcomes).
Thus we can produce the sequence: event3 → event1 → event2 → event4. That yields Event4 happening, so C1 can hold.

Conclusion:
- Since there is a valid sequence in the given rules that makes Event4 happen, C1 is not ruled out. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False.

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event3 happens, so by the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" we get event1 next.
- After event1, one allowed option is event2. After event2, one allowed option is event4. So there exists a valid sequence (event3 → event1 → event2 → event4) in which event4 happens. Thus C1 (event4 happens) can be satisfied.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the statements
- Let p = ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (this is C1).
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"", i.e. p → (event3 happens).

Step 2 — clarify meaning
- Interpreting ""event3 happens"" in C2 as the same occurrence asserted by p (the event happening in that next state), C2 is just p → p.

Step 3 — evaluate
- p → p is a tautology (always true). The transition rules in the context are irrelevant for this logical implication.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (i.e. C1 → event3)

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event3 happened.
- The context says: ""After event3, no other events can happen."" So no event (including event3) can occur in the next state after the initial event3. Therefore C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Since C1 is false, C2 (if C1 then event3) is true.
- (Also note: even without vacuity, the statement C1 → event3 is tautological here because C1 itself asserts event3 in the next state.)

- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens.""
- C2 simply asserts that from ""event3 happens in the next state"" we can conclude ""event3 happens"" (i.e. the same event occurrence). This is a tautological implication (C1 implies the same fact), and nothing in the given conditions contradicts it.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., C1 = Event2 ∧ Event1).
- C2 asserts ""(If C1 holds) then Event2 happens"", i.e., (Event2 ∧ Event1) → Event2.
- The implication (A ∧ B) → A is a logical tautology, so C2 is always true regardless of the other event constraints.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens and event1 happens. (E2 ∧ E1)
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. ( (E2 ∧ E1) → E2 )

Step 2 — logical analysis:
- The implication (E2 ∧ E1) → E2 is a logical tautology: if both E2 and E1 are true, then E2 is necessarily true.
- This holds regardless of the given event constraints; the antecedent already includes E2.

Conclusion:
True
---
Analysis:
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., E2 ∧ E1).
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (i.e., (E2 ∧ E1) → E2).

Logical fact: (P ∧ Q) → P is a tautology. Therefore whenever C1 holds, event2 necessarily holds (by the conjunction). The background event rules are irrelevant to this logical implication.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = (Event2 happens) OR (Event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (Event3 happens).
So C2 is essentially “Event3 happens” (because if Event3 happens then C1 is satisfied).

Step 2 — what the context gives:
- “Initially, event3 happened.” That directly asserts Event3 happens.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Since Event3 happens, C1 is true, and C2 (C1 and Event3) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step:

- Initially, event3 happened. So event3 is true.
- From ""After event3, event2 must happen"" we get event2 happens (after that initial event3).
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event3 happens"" — this is true because both event2 and event3 happen.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" — since C1 is true and event3 happened, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (Event2 happens) OR (Event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (Event3 happens). So C2 is true exactly when Event3 happens (because if Event3 happens then C1 is satisfied, and C2 additionally requires Event3).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- The context explicitly states ""Initially, event3 happened."" That gives Event3 as a fact in the sequence.
- No rule contradicts that initial event3 occurred.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since Event3 did happen (initially), C1 is true (because Event3 satisfies the disjunction) and Event3 itself is true, so C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 happens, and after event1 one of {event2, event4, event5} must occur.
- If event2 or event4 is chosen, then C1 (event2 or event4 happens) is true, so C2 (its negation) is false.
- However, there is also a valid infinite trace 1 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... where neither event2 nor event4 ever occurs, making C1 false there.
- Because C1 can be true in some valid runs and false in others, C1 is not guaranteed; therefore C2 (that C1 does not hold) is not guaranteed true. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning: Initially event1 occurs, and after event1 either event2, event4, or event5 must happen. That means it is possible for event2 or event4 to happen (e.g., pick event2 immediately). C2 asserts that neither event2 nor event4 happens. Since the rules allow sequences where event2 or event4 do occur, C2 is not necessarily true. Therefore C2 is False.
---
We ask whether ""C2: C1 does not hold"" is true given the context. C1 says ""Event2 happens or event4 happens."" So C2 says ""Neither event2 nor event4 happens.""

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules require that after event1 one of event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
- If after the initial event1 we choose event2 or event4, then C1 holds, so C2 is false in that execution.
- It is also possible to choose event5 after event1; after event5 event1 must happen, and then we can again choose event5, etc. This yields an execution with only event1 and event5 repeating, never event2 or event4, so C2 would hold in that execution.

Because both kinds of executions are allowed by the rules, C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is not true (i.e., we cannot conclude C2). Final answer: False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2: ""If C1 holds (Event4 happens and Event2 happens), then Event3 happens.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, Event4 happened.
- After Event4, Event3 must happen. (So Event3 is required after the initial Event4.)
- Other rules (after Event3 → Event4, after Event2 → Event1 or Event4, etc.) do not provide any way to prevent the required Event3.

Step 3 — reasoning:
- Because Event4 has already happened initially, the rule ""after Event4, Event3 must happen"" forces Event3 to occur at some point, regardless of whether Event2 occurs or not.
- Adding Event2 (so C1 holds) does not remove or block the obligation that Event3 must occur.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step-by-step reasoning:

- We are asked whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is true. C1 asserts that event4 happens and event2 happens.
- From the context: ""Initially, event4 happened."" and ""After event4, event3 must happen.""
- Because event4 already occurred initially, the rule ""after event4, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur (immediately after that initial event4).
- Therefore any scenario in which C1 holds (which requires event4 to have happened) will already include event3. The occurrence of event2 is irrelevant to this forced occurrence of event3.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 asserts that event4 happens (and event2 happens).
- One of the given rules is: ""After event4, event3 must happen."" That is a mandatory implication: whenever event4 occurs, event3 must occur afterward.
- Therefore, under C1 (which includes event4 happening), event3 must happen.

So C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is true."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 occurs.
- The rule ""After event3, either event1 or event5 must happen"" allows choosing event5.
- If we take that branch, event5 occurs, so both event3 and event5 happen — exactly C1.
- Therefore C1 holds, so ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happens, so the ""event3 happens"" part of C1 is true.
- From event3 the rule says either event1 or event5 must happen next. That is a choice, not a forced appearance of event5.
- If we choose event5 after event3, then both event3 and event5 occur and C1 holds.
- But we can equally choose event1 after event3 and then keep cycling between event1 and event3 (since after event1 either event3 or event5 must happen), never taking the branch to event5. In that case C1 does not hold.
- Because there exist models where C1 holds and models where C1 does not hold, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not entailed by the context.

Therefore C2 is not guaranteed true — answer: False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 happens and event5 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., NOT(Event3 and Event5) → equivalently, event5 does not happen, since Event3 is given).

Step 2 — examine the facts/rules
- Initially event3 happened (so Event3 is true).
- After event3, either event1 or event5 must happen. (So from the given state, event5 may occur.)
- Other rules allow various continuations (1→{3,5}, 5→{3,4}, 4→{1,2,3}, 2→1), but none forbid event5 from occurring.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event3 we can choose event5 next (allowed by the rule “after event3 either event1 or event5 must happen”). That yields a sequence where both Event3 (initial) and Event5 occur, so C1 holds in that sequence.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Because there exists an allowed sequence where both Event3 and Event5 occur, C1 can be true. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed/entailed and is false.

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the claims:
- C1: ""Event4 does not happen"" (i.e., no occurrence of event4).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is a point from which event4 never happens (eventually always not event4).

We ask whether C2 must hold given the transition rules and the initial event3.

Key transitions (unique ones):
- 3 → 5 (forced)
- 5 → {2, 3, 4}
- 4 → 5 (forced)
- 2 → {1, 3, 4, 5}
- 1 → {2, 5}

Counterexample showing C2 is not guaranteed:
Start at 3 (given), then follow: 3 → 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → ...  
Each step respects the rules: 3 must go to 5; 5 may go to 4; 4 must go to 5. This trace contains infinitely many event4 occurrences, so there is never a point after which event4 stops. Thus C2 is not necessarily true.

(There do exist traces that avoid event4, e.g. 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → …, but since C2 is not guaranteed on all possible runs, it is false as a required consequence.)

Final answer: False
---

---
False

Reasoning:
- Start: event3 occurs. By the rule ""after event3, event5 must happen"", we get event5.
- From event5, one allowed next event is event4. From event4, event5 must happen. So the sequence 3 → 5 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ... is possible, producing event4 infinitely often.
- Because there is a possible run in which event4 keeps happening forever, it is not guaranteed that at some future point event4 will never happen. Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is not ensured."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 is: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
So C2 reads: ""If event3 happens, then event3 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
So in every execution, event2 occurs and then the run stops; event3 never actually occurs. (Other rules about event3↔event5 or event4 are irrelevant because nothing can follow event2.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Logically, the implication ""if event3 happens, then event3 eventually happens"" is true in two senses:
  1) Vacuously true in this system because event3 never happens (false antecedent ⇒ implication true).
  2) Even conceptually, if event3 did happen at some time, then the statement ""event3 eventually happens"" would be satisfied — the implication is tautologically valid.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
   - C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Unpacked: ""If event3 happens, then event3 eventually happens.""

2. Examine meaning:
   - ""Event3 happens"" means there is an occurrence of event3 at some point.
   - ""Event3 eventually happens"" means there exists some point in the run/sequence at which event3 occurs.

3. Logical relation:
   - If event3 happens at some point, then by definition there exists a point where event3 occurs — i.e. event3 eventually happens. The antecedent guarantees the consequent.

4. The system constraints are irrelevant to this implication; the statement is tautologically true.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 states: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event3 eventually happens."" So C2 reads: if event3 happens then event3 eventually happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So the system halts immediately after the initial event2.
- Therefore no further events (including event3) can occur in the actual scenario → C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication: (event3 happens) → (event3 eventually happens).
- If event3 does happen at some time, then certainly event3 eventually happens (it already occurred). If event3 never happens, the implication is vacuously true.
- Thus C2 is true in all cases.

True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event1 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event4 or event5 must happen next (no option for event1).

Step 3 — reason:
- Because the immediate successor of event2 must be either event4 or event5, Event1 cannot be the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: not C1 (Event1 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine conditions and the initial state:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, the next event must be either event4 or event5.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- From event2 the immediate next event can only be event4 or event5.
- Neither event4 nor event5 is event1, so event1 cannot occur in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 is true.

True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2 asserts the negation of C1: ""Event1 does not happen in the next state.""
- From the context: the initial event is event2, and ""after event2, either event4 or event5 must happen."" That fixes the immediate next state to be either event4 or event5.
- Therefore the immediate next state cannot be event1, so C1 is false.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., neither event5 nor event3 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event1 happened.""
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" => no events can occur after event1.
- The other rules only constrain what happens after events 2–5, but none can occur because nothing can happen after event1.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since no events can occur after event1, event3 and event5 do not happen, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (that C1 does not hold) is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event5 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event5 nor event3 happens).
Question: Is C2 true?

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- All other ""after"" rules (after event3 → ..., after event2 → ..., after event5 → ..., after event4 → ...) only apply to events that would occur after some event; they do not force anything that happened before event1.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, no further events occur at all.
- Therefore event3 does not happen and event5 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 (""event5 or event3"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no events can occur after event1, so event3 and event5 do not happen.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happened. From ""After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"", the next state must be event1 or event2.
- C1 is the state formula ""if event4 happens then event5 happens"" (event4 -> event5). In any state where event4 is false the implication is vacuously true.
- In both possible next states (event1 or event2) event4 does not occur, so C1 holds in each of them.
Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts: ""If event4 happens, then event5 happens"" — i.e. after event4 we must get event5.
- The context says: after event4, either event3 or event5 must happen. So event4 does not guarantee event5 (event3 is an allowed alternative). Thus C1 is not generally true.
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state. From the initial event3 the next state can be event1 (since after event3 one possibility is event1).
- In a state where event1 holds, event4 can occur next (after event1 one option is event4), and after that event3 can follow (not event5), which violates C1.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Model the rules as transitions between events (start at event1).
- From 1 you must go to 4 (1 -> 4).
- From 2 you go to 1 or 4; if 2 -> 1 then the next step is 1 -> 4, so 4 occurs.
- From 3 you go to 1, 4, or 5. If 3 -> 1 then 1 -> 4; if 3 -> 5 then 5 -> 2 or 4, and 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 forces 4 eventually; if 3 -> 4 it's immediate.
- From 5 you go to 2 or 4; either choice leads to 4 eventually (5 -> 4 directly, or 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4).
- From 4 you may move to 1,2,3, or 5, but every one of those states leads back to 4 as shown.

There is no cycle that can avoid event4 indefinitely, so event4 is inevitable in every run. Therefore C1 holds and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or Event5 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state.""
You are asked whether C2 is True or False given the rules and the initial condition.

Step 2 — given rules (summary):
- Initially: event5 happened.
- After event5 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event3 → event1 must happen.
- After event4 → one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen.

Step 3 — trace the immediate next state:
- From the initial state (event5 happened), the rule ""after event5 → event1 must happen"" forces the next event to be event1.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 in that next state:
- In the next state event1 happens, so ""event1 or event5"" is true; therefore C1 holds in the next state.

Conclusion:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurred.
- The rule ""After event5, event1 must happen"" forces the next event to be event1.
- Therefore in the next state event1 happens, so the disjunction ""event1 or event5"" (C1) is satisfied there.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event5 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C1 is true in the next state after the initial state.

Step 2 — Use the context:
- Initially, event5 happened (current state S0).
- Rule: After event5, event1 must happen. So in the next state S1, event1 happens.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 in the next state:
- In S1, event1 happens, so ""event1 or event5"" is true.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 occurs (given).
- After event1, allowed next events are {event2, event5}. Choose event5.
- After event5, allowed next events are {event2, event3}. Choose event3.
- After event3, allowed next events are {event2, event4}. Choose event4.
- After event4, allowed next events are {event1, event2, event3}. Choose event1.
- Now we are back at event1 and can repeat the cycle 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 indefinitely, never taking event2.

This sequence is consistent with all given constraints, contains both event1 and event5 (so C1 holds), but never contains event2. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed and C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the claim:
- C1: Event5 happens and event1 happens (i.e., both occur somewhere in the run).
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens (i.e., every run that contains both event1 and event5 must also contain event2).
We must decide whether C2 necessarily follows from the given transition rules.

Step 2 — Relevant rules (transitions):
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 → either event2 or event5.
- After event5 → either event2 or event3.
- After event3 → either event2 or event4.
- After event4 → either event1, event2, or event3.
- After event2 → either event1, event4, or event5.

Step 3 — Construct a counterexample run that satisfies C1 but avoids event2:
- Start: event1 (given initially).
- From event1 choose event5 (allowed). Now both event1 and event5 have happened → C1 holds.
- From event5 choose event3 (allowed).
- From event3 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event5 again, and repeat the cycle 5 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 5 ...
This infinite cycle contains only events {1,5,3,4} and never produces event2, so C1 holds while event2 never happens.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
Because there exists a valid run where C1 holds but event2 never occurs, the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
We need to check whether ""If C1 holds (event5 and event1 happen) then event2 happens"" is logically forced by the rules.

Relevant rules (transitions):
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1 → {event2, event5}.
- After event5 → {event2, event3}.
- After event3 → {event2, event4}.
- After event4 → {event1, event2, event3}.
- (After event2 → {event1, event4, event5} also exists but we will avoid using event2.)

Counterexample (valid sequence avoiding event2):
1. Initially event1 occurs.
2. From event1 choose event5 (allowed).
3. From event5 choose event3 (allowed).
4. From event3 choose event4 (allowed).
5. From event4 choose event1 (allowed).
Repeat this loop: 1 → 5 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 5 → ...

This infinite cycle satisfies all transition requirements, includes both event1 and event5, and never includes event2. Therefore C1 can hold without event2 occurring, so the implication in C2 is not forced.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event5 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transitions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next. (No rule allows event5 immediately after event1.)
- Other rules (after 4 → 2|3|5, after 5 → 1|4, after 2 → terminal, after 3 → terminal) do not change what can happen immediately after the initial event1.

Step 3 — trace the next state:
- From initial event1 the next event is forced to be either event2 or event4.
- Neither of those is event5, so event5 cannot occur in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
True.

Reason: Initially event1 happened, and the rule ""After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen"" forces the next state to be event2 or event4. In either case event5 does not occur in that next state, so C1 holds in the next state.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event5 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, event5 does not occur.
- Initially event1 happened. The rule ""After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen"" fixes the immediate next event: it must be event2 or event4.
- In either case, event5 cannot be the immediate next event. (If event2 happens next, no further events can happen; if event4 happens next, event5 might occur later but not in that immediate next state.)

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says “Event5 always happens” (i.e., in every allowed future trace event5 must occur). C2 states the negation of C1.
- From the initial event4, the rules allow next either event1 or event2.
- If we pick event2 after event4, the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” forces event1 next.
- From event1 we may choose event2 (rules allow event2, event4, or event5 after event1). Choosing event2 returns us to event1, and we can repeat the cycle event1 ↔ event2 indefinitely.
- That infinite cycle contains no event5, so there exists a valid trace (consistent with all rules) in which event5 never happens. Thus event5 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C1 is false and C2 (C1 does not hold) is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- Start: event4 happened.
- From event4 we may choose event2 (allowed).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1 we may choose event2 (allowed).
- Thus we can loop 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 … forever without ever taking the option that leads to event5.

Because there exists a valid sequence (indeed an infinite one) consistent with the rules that never includes event5, the claim ""Event5 always happens"" is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event5 always happens (i.e., every allowed continuation eventually contains event5).
- C2: C1 does not hold.

Step 2 — relevant rules (from initial event4):
- Start: event4.
- After event4: either event1 or event2.
- After event1: either event2, event4, or event5.
- After event2: event1 must happen.
(Other rules about event3 and event5 are not needed here.)

Step 3 — counterexample showing C1 fails:
- Choose the continuation 4 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... .
  - 4 → 1 is allowed (after 4: 1 or 2).
  - 1 → 2 is allowed.
  - 2 → 1 is required.
- This infinite trace never contains event5, so event5 is not guaranteed to occur in all continuations.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning, step by step:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4 no other events can happen.
So the only possible execution is event2 → event4 and then stop. Event3 never occurs in any future of the given start.

C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" In the actual execution/event structure event3 never happens, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C1 already holds (from the start), hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" (a conditional about occurrences)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — i.e., at some point in the execution, the conditional C1 is true (or equivalently: C1 holds in the run).

Step 2 — examine the conditions / rules
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event4 must happen.
- After event4, no other events can happen.
- Other rules (after event1 → one of 2,3,5; after event5 → one of 1,2,3; after event3 → no other events) are irrelevant unless those events can occur.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- From the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event4 must happen"" forces event4 next.
- After event4, no further events can occur, so the run is exactly: event2 → event4 → stop.
- No run can include event3 (there is no way to reach event3 starting from the forced initial sequence).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event3 never occurs in the only possible run, the implication ""if event3 happens, then event2 happens"" is vacuously true (there are no occurrences of event3 to falsify it).
- Therefore C1 holds (indeed it holds at all points), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: event2 happened initially.
- From event2, event4 must happen next.
- From event4, no other events can happen. So the only possible execution sequence is 2 → 4 and then termination.
- Event3 can never occur in any reachable sequence.
- C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" Because event3 never happens, the implication is vacuously true in every reachable execution (there is no counterexample where 3 happens without 2).
- Therefore C1 already holds (immediately), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Thus C2 is True."

Votes: {'False': 2, 'True': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens, so the next state must be event3, event4, or event5. Thus C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is not actually true in the given start.
- More importantly, the rules say: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. That means event2 is not guaranteed after event1 (event3 is a possible successor).
- Therefore the claim ""If event1 happens in the next state, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed by the rules — it can fail when event1 is followed by event3. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning: The rules say that after event1 the next event can be either event2 or event3. That means event2 is not guaranteed when event1 occurs, so the conditional ""if event1 then event2"" does not hold in all allowed transitions. (Also, from the initial event2 the next state must be 3,4, or 5, so event1 doesn't occur next — but the key point is that event1 does not necessarily lead to event2.)
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says ""event1 happens in the next state."" The context says initially event2 happened, and after event2 the next event must be event3, event4, or event5. So event1 cannot be the next event — C1 is impossible in this situation.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a impossible antecedent is vacuously true.
- (Note: independently, the rule after event1 allows either event2 or event3, so event2 would not be guaranteed if event1 actually occurred; however C1 cannot occur next given the initial event2, so C2 is still true vacuously.)

Answer: False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 means ""event1 never happens"" (throughout the future).
- C2 means ""eventually C1 holds"" — i.e., at some future point we reach a situation after which event1 never occurs.
- From the rules we can construct an infinite run that keeps producing event1 forever: start with event4 (given), then choose event1 (4 -> 1 is allowed), then 1 -> 2, then 2 -> 1, then 1 -> 2, etc. The sequence 4,1,2,1,2,... is allowed by the transitions and contains event1 infinitely often, so C1 never becomes true on that run. Therefore it is not guaranteed that ""event1 eventually never happens.""
- Because there exists at least one valid execution that prevents C1 from ever holding, C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event4 happens and event1 happens"" (E4 ∧ E1).
- C2 = ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" ( (E4 ∧ E1) → E4 ).

Step 2 — logical observation:
- (E4 ∧ E1) → E4 is a basic logical tautology (conjunction elimination). If both E4 and E1 hold, then E4 necessarily holds.

Step 3 — (optional) check consistency with the context:
- The context rules actually make E1 impossible (no rule leads to event2, and event1 can only occur after event2), so C1 is impossible in the scenario — which would make the implication vacuously true anyway. But this is unnecessary given step 2.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"") is true, given C1 (""Event4 happens and event1 happens"") and the context rules.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1 asserts the conjunction: event4 AND event1.
- From a conjunction, we can infer each conjunct (conjunction-elimination). So C1 directly entails event4.
- Therefore the implication ""if C1 then event4"" is valid. (Even if C1 were impossible under the context, the implication would be vacuously true.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 is the implication: If C1 holds, then event4 happens.
- C1 asserts: event4 happens AND event1 happens.

Step 2 — logical relationship:
- C1's antecedent already includes ""event4 happens"". So C2 has the form (A AND B) → A, which is a logical tautology: whenever A∧B is true, A is necessarily true.

Step 3 — note about the event rules:
- Even if the event rules made C1 impossible, an implication with an impossible antecedent is still true (vacuously true). So the event-system constraints do not make the implication false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event1 happened.
- After event1 one of {event2, event4, event5} must happen.
  - If event4 happens, C1 (event4 or event3) is true.
  - If event2 happens, then after event2 one of {event1, event3, event4} must happen:
    - If event3 or event4 happens then C1 is true.
    - If event1 happens we return to the same choice and can later choose event3 or event4, or choose event5.
  - If event5 happens, no further events occur, so neither event3 nor event4 need happen (C1 false).
- Because there are valid sequences where C1 is true (e.g., 1→4) and valid sequences where C1 is false (e.g., 1→5), C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is not true.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context gives possible transitions starting from event1: after event1 one of {event2, event4, event5} must occur.
- C1 asserts that event4 or event3 happens (somewhere in the sequence).
- There are allowed sequences that make C1 true (e.g., choose event4 immediately: 1 → 4, so event4 happens; or 1 → 2 → 3, so event3 happens).
- There is also an allowed sequence that makes C1 false: choose event5 after event1. After event5 no further events can happen, so neither event3 nor event4 ever occurs (1 → 5 and stop).
- Because both possibilities exist, the context does not entail C1, and it also does not entail ¬C1. C2 (which claims ¬C1) is therefore not guaranteed by the context — so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start: event1.
- From event1 one possible next event is event4 (or event2 or event5). If event4 occurs, C1 (event4 or event3) is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
- Also from event1 you can go to event2, and from event2 to event3, so event3 can occur as well, making C1 true and C2 false.
- Although there is a path 1 -> 5 that ends without 3 or 4, the context allows paths where 3 or 4 do happen. Therefore C2 is not entailed and is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, event5 must happen"" forces the next state after the initial event2 to be event5.
- Other rules do not override or contradict that mandatory consequence.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Starting from the initial event2, the next state must be event5. Therefore event3 does not occur in the next state.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the next-state requirement:
- Initially event2 happened.

Step 2 — apply the transition rule for event2:
- The context says: ""After event2, event5 must happen."" That forces the next state to be event5.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" This is false, because the next state must be event5.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

- The rule ""After event2, event5 must happen"" forces the very next event to be event5.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event4 eventually happens.""
- Hypothesis C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, event4 will eventually occur).
- From the given conditions: ""After event1, event4 must happen."" This is a direct, mandatory transition — there is no alternative that avoids event4 after event1.
- Therefore whenever event1 occurs, event4 necessarily follows, so event4 does eventually happen. That makes C2 true.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The system rules include ""After event1, event4 must happen."" That means whenever event1 occurs, event4 is guaranteed to occur next (hence eventually).
2. C1 (Event4 eventually happens) is true in any run that contains event1, because rule (1) forces event4 after event1.
3. C2 says: if event1 happens, then C1 holds. Given (1), this implication always holds.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses
- C1: Event4 eventually happens.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 occurs then event4 will eventually occur).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- After event1, event4 must happen. (1 -> 4)
- Other rules are nondeterministic but irrelevant for this implication.

Step 3 — reason through sequences
- Whenever event1 occurs, the rule 1 -> 4 forces event4 to occur next. Therefore event4 does eventually happen after any occurrence of event1.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 always happens (i.e., on every possible future sequence).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., there exists a sequence where Event3 never occurs).

Step 2 — extract transitions (from the text):
- 4 → {1, 5}
- 1 → {2, 3, 5}
- 2 → {4, 5}
- 5 → {1, 3}
- 3 → 2

Step 3 — look for a counterexample to C1 (a path from the initial 4 that never hits 3):
- Start at 4 (given).
- Choose 4 → 1 (allowed).
- Choose 1 → 2 (allowed).
- Choose 2 → 4 (allowed).
This yields the cycle 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → … which avoids event3 forever.

Since there exists a valid infinite sequence that never includes event3, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Start at event4 (given).
- From 4 we can go to 1. From 1 we can choose 2. From 2 we can choose 4. That yields the cycle 4 → 1 → 2 → 4 → ...
- This cycle is allowed by the rules and contains no event3. Therefore there exists a valid (infinite) execution in which event3 never occurs.
- Hence ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false, so ""C1 does not hold"" (C2) is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 always happens (in every possible evolution).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., there is some evolution where event3 never happens).

Step 2 — transitions (from the rules):
- Start: 4.
- 3 -> 2.
- 2 -> {4, 5}.
- 4 -> {1, 5}.
- 5 -> {1, 3}.
- 1 -> {2, 3, 5}.

Step 3 — find an evolution avoiding event3:
- From 4 choose 1 (allowed).
- From 1 choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2 choose 4 (allowed).
- Repeat 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... forever.

This infinite cycle contains no event3, so event3 is not guaranteed to occur.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says: whenever event1 happens, event2 happens. But the rules say after event1 either event3 or event4 must happen — so event2 does not follow event1.
- Initially event3 happened. The next state must be event2 or event4.
- In both possible next states (event2 or event4) event1 is a possible next event (from event2 you can go to event1; from event4 you can go to event1). If event1 then occurs, it is followed by event3 or event4, not event2 — so C1 is false in those states.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — meaning of the formulas
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a state formula (an implication about events in the same state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted as: in every immediate successor state, C1 is true.

Step 2 — successors of the initial state
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the next state must be either event2 or event4.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in each successor
- In a state where event2 happened, event1 is false, so the implication (event1 → event2) is vacuously true.
- In a state where event4 happened, event1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true there as well.

Since C1 is true in all immediate successors, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the claim
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e., after event1 must follow event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asking whether C1 is true in the immediate successor of the initial state.

Step 2 — Examine the transition rules
- After event1, the rules say: either event3 or event4 must happen. Event2 is not guaranteed after event1.

Step 3 — Reasoning / counterexample
- Because after event1 the next event can be event3 or event4 (not necessarily event2), C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false (it fails wherever you evaluate it), C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False"

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The rules include ""Initially, event4 happened"" and ""After event4, event1 must happen."" So event1 does happen. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in any model of the context.

- C2 states: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — equivalently, event3 ⇒ (event1 does not happen). To falsify this implication it suffices to produce a valid sequence where event3 occurs but event1 also occurs.

- A concrete valid sequence: event4 (initial) → event1 (required after event4) → event3 (allowed after event1). In this sequence both event3 and event1 occur, so the antecedent of C2 is true while the consequent C1 is false. Hence C2 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C2 is False.
---
C2 asserts: ""If event3 happens, then event1 does not happen.""

From the context: initially event4 happened, and after event4 event1 must happen. After event1, event3 is one of the allowed next events. So the sequence 4 → 1 → 3 is allowed. In that sequence event3 happens while event1 also happens, so the implication ""if 3 then not 1"" is false.

Answer: False
---
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially event4 happens.
- After event4, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1 says ""Event1 does not happen."" That contradicts the forced event1, so C1 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 (""If event3 happens, then C1 holds""):
- After event1, event3 is allowed (after event1 the next can be event2, event3, or event5), so there is a valid sequence 4 → 1 → 3 where event3 occurs.
- In that sequence event1 already happened, so the consequent C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false while the antecedent (event3 happens) is true. Hence the implication is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state).

Step 2 — examine the rules and reachable next states:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next state must be either event2 or event4.
- There are rules for what follows event2, event3, event4, and event5, but there is no rule that allows (or forces) event1 to occur after any event.
- The only rule mentioning event1 is ""After event1, event3 must happen"" — this requires event1 to have occurred, but nothing permits event1 to occur in the first place.

Step 3 — conclude about C1 and C2:
- Since no rule allows event1 to occur, event1 does not happen now and cannot happen in the next state(s).
- Therefore C1 is true now, and C1 also holds in the next state.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (in the current state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the next state, event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and possible next states:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- Neither event2 nor event4 is event1.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- In the initial state (where event5 happened), event1 did not happen, so C1 is true there.
- In the next state the event must be event2 or event4, so event1 does not happen in the next state either. Thus C2 is true.

Conclusion:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Hypothesis:  
   - C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""  
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state, Event1 does not happen.

2. Given initial condition: initially event5 happened.

3. Transition rules from the context:
   - After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen. (So the next state is event2 or event4.)
   - After event2, event4 must happen.
   - After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
   - After event3, either event2, event4, or event5 must happen.
   - After event1, event3 must happen. (This only constrains what follows if event1 occurs.)

   Note: None of the rules ever produce event1 as a next event.

4. From the initial state (event5), the next state must be event2 or event4. Neither option includes event1. Furthermore, in the whole transition graph generated by these rules, no transition yields event1, so event1 cannot occur in the next state (nor in any reachable state).

5. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true in the next state, so C2 is True."

- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some point in the execution C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The formula p → p is a tautology in propositional logic: it is true in every state whether p is true or false. Thus C1 holds in every state of the system (including the initial state).

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- Because C1 is true immediately (and everywhere), it certainly ""eventually holds."" Therefore C2 is true.

- C1 is the formula ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens"" (i.e. event5 → event5).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some point in the timeline where C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the condition:
- The given transition rules determine possible event sequences, but they don't affect the truth of the implication event5 → event5.
- The formula event5 → event5 is a logical tautology (always true in every state): a proposition implies itself.

Step 3 — conclude about C2:
- Because C1 is true at every point in every possible timeline, it certainly holds at some point (indeed at all points). Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is the formula ""If event5 happens, then event5 happens"" (i.e. event5 → event5).
- A formula of the form P → P is a tautology (always true) in propositional/temporal logic: it is true whether P occurs or not.
- Therefore C1 is true at every moment (in particular it is true immediately), so it certainly ""eventually holds.""
- The given event rules (starting from event4 and the possible subsequent sequences) do not affect that logical truth.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From event2, choose event3 (allowed). From event3 choose event5 (allowed). From event5 choose event3 (allowed). This yields an infinite loop 2 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... that never produces event1 or event4.
- Thus it is possible that C1 (event4 or event1 happens) does not hold, so C2 is satisfiable, but it is not entailed by the context (not necessarily true in all models).

Because C2 is not guaranteed by the given constraints, the correct answer is False.
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Transitions: 2 -> {3,4,5}; 3 -> {4,5}; 4 -> {3,5}; 5 -> {1,3,4}; 1 -> {2,4,5}.
- From the initial event2 you can immediately take 2 -> 4, so event4 happens, making C1 true in that scenario. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not entailed by the context.
- (For completeness: there is also a possible run 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 3 -> 5 -> ... that avoids 1 and 4, so C1 can be false in some runs. But because C1 can be true in other runs, C2 is not guaranteed.)
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the rules we have transitions: 2 -> {3,4,5}; 3 -> {4,5}; 4 -> {3,5}; 5 -> {1,3,4}; 1 -> {2,4,5}.
- C1 asserts that event4 or event1 happens at some point.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., neither event4 nor event1 ever happens).
- There exist valid sequences where C1 holds (for example 2 -> 4, so event4 happens), so C2 cannot be guaranteed true.
- Although there also exist sequences avoiding 1 and 4 indefinitely (for example 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 3 -> 5 -> ...), that only shows C1 is not forced; it does not make C2 universally true.

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event1 never happens).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, no other events can happen (terminal).
- Other rules (after event4, after event1, after event3) are irrelevant if event5 terminates the run.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence from the initial condition:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Then, by rule, event5 must happen.
- After event5, the run ends; no further events can occur.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- Event1 cannot occur in this sequence (there is no step allowing another event after event5).
- Therefore C1 is false and C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 never happens).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, no other events can happen (event5 is terminal).
- Other rules (after event1 → event4 or event5; after event3 → event1, event2, or event5; after event4 → event1 or event3) cannot apply before event5 because they require those events to occur first.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s)
- Start: event2 (given).
- From event2 the rule ""after event2, event5 must happen"" forces event5 next.
- Once event5 occurs, ""no other events can happen"" — the sequence ends.
- There is no opportunity for event1 to occur at any point: the forced transition event2 → event5 and the terminal nature of event5 block any later events.

Conclusion
- Event1 cannot eventually happen, so C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 occurs.
- The rules state: after event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, no other events can happen (event5 is terminal).
- Therefore the sequence is event2 → event5 → end; event1 cannot occur.
- Hence C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The system starts with event4.
- The rules state that after event4 no other events can happen. So the only possible execution is the single event4 and then termination.
- In that execution event2 never occurs.
- C1 is the implication ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" In any execution where event2 does not occur, that implication is vacuously true.
- Therefore C1 already holds (immediately) in the only possible execution, so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" (a conditional about any occurrence of event2)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there will come a time when C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event4 happened.
- After event4, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event4 happens initially and no events can occur after event4, the only possible execution is: event4 and then stop.
- Therefore event2 never occurs in any execution.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- If event2 never occurs, the implication ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens"" is vacuously true. So C1 holds immediately.
- Since C1 already holds, ""C1 eventually holds"" is also true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" (a conditional property)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there is some time in the future at which C1 is true)

Step 2 — Understand the rules (condensed)
- Initially event4 occurred.
- After event4, no other events can happen. (terminal)
- After event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4}.
- After event1 → one of {event3, event5}.
- After event3 → one of {event4, event5}.
- After event5 → one of {event1, event2}.

Step 3 — Trace from the initial state
- The initial event is event4 and event4 is terminal (no further events possible).
- Therefore, in the actual run starting from the initial state, event2 never occurs (no events occur after the initial event4).

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""if event2 happens then event3 happens"") is vacuously true on any run where event2 never happens.
- Since C1 is already true at the initial/only reachable state, C1 holds now, hence it “eventually holds.”

- C2 is the statement ""Event5 happens or C1 holds"" (where C1 = ""Event4 happens and Event1 happens"").

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event5 happened. (Given)
- After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- (Other transition rules are irrelevant to the truth of C2 once we note the initial event5.)

Step 3 — Reasoning about C2
- C2 is a disjunction: ""Event5 happens OR C1 holds.""
- Because event5 already happened initially, the disjunction is true regardless of whether C1 ever becomes true.

Optional: note about C1
- C1 can be made true in some continuations (for example: event5 → event4 → event1), but it need not be for C2 to be true.

Brief reasoning (summary):

- C1 is ""event3 happens or event5 happens"" — true because event5 happened.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event5 happens"" — true because both C1 and ""event5 happens"" are true.

- C2: C1 holds and event5 happens. (So C2 is equivalent to ""event5 happens"" because if event5 happens then C1 is automatically true.)

Step 2 — check the facts:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happens. After event3 the next event may be one of {event1, event2, event4, event5}.
- To refute ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"" it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence starting from event3 that never contains event2.
- Choose event1 after event3 (allowed). From event1 you may choose event4 (allowed). After event4 you must have event1. That yields the repeating cycle event1 → event4 → event1 → …, which never involves event2.
- Thus it is possible for event3 to occur without event2 ever happening, so C1 does not hold. Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 asserts: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. every occurrence of event3 must be followed by event2).
- From the rules: after event3 one may have event1, event2, event4, or event5 — event2 is allowed but not required.
- Counterexample trace starting from the given initial event3: choose event1 (allowed), then choose event4 (allowed). After event4, event1 must happen, and then one can choose event4 again, producing the infinite loop ...1 → 4 → 1 → 4... that never includes event2.
- Therefore C1 does not hold, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 says: If event3 happens, then event2 happens (i.e., every occurrence of event3 must be followed by event2).
- C2 says: C1 does not hold (i.e., there is a permitted scenario where event3 occurs but event2 does not).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event1, one of {event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event4, event1 must happen.
- After event5, one of {event1, event2} must happen.
- After event2, one of {event1, event5} must happen.

Step 3 — find a permitted sequence that avoids event2 after event3:
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose event1 after event3 (allowed).
- From event1 choose event4 (allowed).
- From event4 must go to event1, then back to event4, etc.
This yields an infinite valid trace: event3 → event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ...
No event2 ever occurs in this trace, so event3 does not force event2.

Conclusion:
- C1 is not guaranteed by the conditions, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens."" (This claims event1 must occur whenever event5 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True (i.e., C1 is false) or False.

Step 2 — examine the rules (possible next events):
- After 1 -> {2, 5}
- After 2 -> {3, 5}
- After 3 -> {4}
- After 4 -> {2, 3, 5}
- After 5 -> {1, 3}
- Initially event5 happened.

Step 3 — look for a counterexample to C1:
- From the initial 5, choose 3 (allowed: after 5 either 1 or 3).
- From 3 must go to 4.
- From 4 we may choose 3 (allowed).
- Then 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 ... can repeat indefinitely.
This infinite sequence (5, 3, 4, 3, 4, ...) never contains event1, yet follows all the given rules.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid sequence starting from event5 that never leads to event1, C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
First interpret C1: it claims that whenever event5 happens, event1 happens (i.e. event1 necessarily follows event5). The rules say: ""After event5, either event1, or event3 must happen."" That does not force event1 — event3 is also allowed.

Construct a valid sequence that violates C1: start with the given initial event5, then choose the allowed follow-up event3. After event3 must come event4. After event4 we may choose event5. This gives a loop:

event5 → event3 → event4 → event5 → event3 → event4 → ...

This valid sequence contains many occurrences of event5 but never event1. Therefore C1 does not hold. So C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: If event5 happens, then event1 happens (i.e., every time event5 occurs, event1 must follow at some point).
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event5 occurs but event1 does not necessarily happen).

Step 2 — examine conditions (transition rules):
- Start: event5 happened.
- After 5 → {1, 3}
- After 3 → {4}
- After 4 → {2, 3, 5}
- After 2 → {3, 5}
- After 1 → {2, 5}

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C1:
- From the initial 5, choose 3 (allowed).
- Then 3 → 4, and 4 → 3 is allowed.
- So we can loop 5 → 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... forever, never taking the 5→1 option and thus never seeing event1.

Because such a valid sequence exists where event5 happens but event1 never occurs, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- From the rules: after event4 the next event can be event2 or event5; after event5 the next event can be event1, event3, or event4.
- Starting at the initial event4, pick the choices 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> ... (after 4 choose 5, after 5 choose 4, and repeat). This is a valid infinite sequence under the given rules.
- In that sequence event2 never occurs and event3 never occurs. Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not guaranteed, and event3 is not guaranteed either.
- Hence the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is not guaranteed by the rules.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Start: event4 occurs initially.

2. Show C1 is false (Event2 does not always happen):
   - From event4 you may go to event5 (allowed). From event5 you may go back to event4 (allowed). This gives an infinite loop 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ... that never includes event2. Hence event2 does not necessarily occur in every possible sequence, so C1 is false.

3. Show ""event3 happens"" is possible:
   - From the start 4 → 5 → 3 is an allowed sequence (5 can be followed by 3), so event3 can occur in some run.

4. C2 is ""C1 holds or event3 happens"". Since C1 is false but event3 can happen, the disjunction is true.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context we get transitions:
  1 -> {2,3,5}; 2 -> {1,4,5}; 3 -> {1,2,4}; 4 -> {2,5}; 5 -> {1,3,4}. Initial event is 4.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") would require every event from now on to be event2. But 2 has no self-loop (2 -> {1,4,5}), so it's impossible for event2 to occur at every step forever. Thus C1 cannot hold.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" Since C1 cannot hold, for C2 to be true we would need event3 to occur on every possible run.
- Counterexample run avoiding event3: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... (repeat). This run never visits event3, and not every event is 2 (so C1 is false). Therefore C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C2 says: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""  
- C1 is ""Event4 always happens."" So C2 is: either Event1 happens at some point, or Event4 is guaranteed (in every run).

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition
- Initially event2 happened.
- From event2 the next event must be one of {event3, event4, event5}.
- From event3 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event4}.
- From event5 → event4 → event1 → event5 is forced (1→5→4→1 forms a cycle).
- From event4 → event1 → ... so if you ever hit 4 you will reach 1.

Step 3 — look for a counterexample run
- Start at event2. Choose event3. From event3 choose event2. From event2 choose event3 again. Repeat forever: 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ...
- This infinite run obeys all ""after"" constraints but never reaches event4 and never reaches event1.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid run in which neither event1 ever happens nor event4 is guaranteed, C2 is not entailed. Therefore the hypothesis C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: event2 happened.
- From event2 we can choose event3 (rule: after event2 either 3, 4, or 5 must happen).
- From event3 we can choose event2 (rule: after event3 either 1, 2, or 4 must happen).
- Repeating the choices 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 ... yields an infinite run where neither event1 nor event4 ever occurs.
- In that run, C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false (there is a run with no event4), and ""Event1 happens"" is also false (event1 never occurs).
- Therefore the disjunction C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is false (both disjuncts can be false).
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Hypothesis C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event4 always happens.""
- From the rules and the initial fact (event2 happened), after event2 one of event3, event4, or event5 must occur.
- Consider the allowed choices that avoid event1 and event4: choose event3 after event2, then choose event2 after event3, then event3 after event2, and so on. The infinite sequence
  event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ...
  is permitted by the rules (E2 → E3 is allowed; E3 → E2 is allowed).
- In that run neither event1 nor event4 ever occurs. Thus:
  - Event1 does not necessarily happen (there is a run where it never happens).
  - C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false because we have a run where event4 never happens.
- Therefore the disjunction in C2 is not guaranteed; C2 is false."

Step 1 — identify rules and start:
- Start: event5 happened.
- Transitions: 5 → 4; 4 → {1,2}; 1 → {2,5}; 2 → 3; 3 → {1,4,5}.

Step 2 — consider the immediate possibilities from the start:
- From 5 we must go to 4.
- From 4 we must choose either 1 or 2.

Step 3 — analyze the two cases:
- If 4 → 1, then event1 happens, so C1 holds, hence C2 (event3 happens or C1 holds) is true.
- If 4 → 2, then 2 → 3 (forced), so event3 happens, so C2 is true.

In every possible branch from the initial state, either event1 occurs or event3 occurs. Therefore C2 is always satisfied.

Final answer:
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - If event1 happens then C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true, so C2 (event3 happens or C1 holds) is true.
  - If event2 happens then event3 must happen afterward, so event3 happens and therefore C2 is true.

In every possible branch from the initial condition C2 holds.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happens, and after event5 event4 must happen. So we have 5 -> 4.
- After event4 either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - If from 4 we take event2, then after event2 event3 must happen, so event3 occurs.
  - If from 4 we take event1, then event1 occurs.
- Thus from the initial state, at the first choice after 4 either event3 will occur (via 2) or event1 will occur (via 1).

Sample responses:
We want to evaluate C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Interpret the event rules as a directed graph of allowed next events:
- 2 -> 1
- 1 -> {3,4,5}
- 3 -> {1,5}
- 4 -> {3,5}
- 5 -> {2,3,4}

Start: event3 has happened.

Can event2 be guaranteed to eventually happen (C1)? No. From 3 you can go to 1, and from 1 back to 3, so there is an infinite behavior 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> ... that never visits event5 or event2. Thus event2 may never happen; C1 is not guaranteed (C1 is false).

C2 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" At the current point no event2 has happened yet, and C1 is false (not guaranteed). Therefore the disjunction is false (it is not necessarily true).

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Start at event3. From 3 you may go to 1 or 5.
- There exists a path reaching event2 (3 → 5 → 2), so event2 is possible.
- But nothing forces taking that path: you can loop 3 → 1 → 3 indefinitely and avoid event2 forever.
- Therefore ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed (false as a universal inevitability).
- ""C2: C1 holds or event2 happens"" is also false (event2 does not happen now, and C1 is false).
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future time).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — that is, either Event2 will happen eventually, or Event2 happens (now/at some step).

Step 2 — examine the transition rules from the initial state
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3, the next event must be either event1 or event5.
- From event1, the next event must be event3, event4, or event5.
- From event5, the next event may be event2, event3, or event4.
- From event4, the next event may be event3 or event5.
(Other rules are redundant repetitions.)

Step 3 — find a run that avoids event2
- Start at event3 (given).
- Choose the transition event3 → event1.
- From event1 choose event1 → event3.
- Repeat: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... forever.

This infinite run respects all rules but never includes event2. So along this run:
- ""event2 happens"" is false (it never occurs),
- ""event2 eventually happens"" is false (it never occurs at any future time).

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Since there is a permitted run in which neither disjunct holds, C2 is not guaranteed and thus is false.

Sample responses:

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e. event1 is inevitable in any execution starting from the given initial condition)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" So C2 is asking whether C1 is true (event1 is inevitable).

Step 2 — list the relevant conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (stated twice, same constraint)
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.
- After event5, event4 must happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences from the initial condition
- The system starts with event2. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is mandatory, so event1 must occur following the initial event2. There is no alternative to avoid event1 here.
- Thus every execution that starts with the given initial event2 contains event1. (Subsequent choices/loops do not remove the already-required occurrence of event1.)

Conclusion
- C1 is true (event1 necessarily happens). Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur next, so event1 does happen at least once.
- But after event1 we may choose event3 (allowed), and after event3 we may choose event4 (allowed). After event4 the rule forces event3, and after that we can choose event4 again — producing an infinite cycle ...3,4,3,4... that never contains event1.
- Therefore event1 does not necessarily occur at all times (nor in every future step). So the claim ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed, hence ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false."

- C1 claims ""if event1 happens, then event4 happens."" Given event1 does happen but event4 cannot occur afterward, C1 is false.
- C2 asserts ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Because event1 does happen but C1 is false, C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens.""
- Logically C2 is equivalent to C1 (A -> (A -> B) is equivalent to A -> B), so C2 is true exactly when C1 is true.
- From the context we know ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 occurs no further events (including event4) can occur afterward.
- There is nothing in the context forcing event4 to have happened before event1, so we cannot conclude event4 happens at all.
- Therefore C1 (""if event1 then event4"") does not hold, and hence C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened"" and also ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 occurs and no further events (including event4) can occur after it.
- C1 asserts: if event1 happens, then event4 happens. Given the context, event1 happens but no other event can occur afterward, so there is no way for event4 to occur as a consequence of event1. Therefore C1 is false (not entailed by the premises).
- C2 states: if event1 happens, then C1 holds. Logically this is equivalent to C1 (if p then (p -> q) is equivalent to p -> q), so C2 is false for the same reason C1 is false.

Thus C2 is False."

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true, where C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

1) Understand the claim:
- C2 says: in every state, the next event is Event1.

2) Use the given rules and the initial state:
- Initially event2 happened.
- From event2, the next event must be either event3 or event5 (not event1).

Therefore from the initial state the next event need not be Event1, so C1 does not hold in that state.

3) A concrete counterexample (shows C2 false):
- Start: event2.
- Choose next = event3 (allowed). That next is not event1.
- We can even loop: event2 → event3 → choose event2 → event3 → …, never producing event1.

Because there exists a reachable state where the next event is not event1, C1 is not always true. Hence C2 is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 says: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C2 claims that in every state the immediate next event is Event1.

Examine the rules and the initial condition:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event3 or event5 must happen next.

From the initial state, the next event need not be event1; it can be event3 or event5. For a concrete counterexample, pick event5 as the next event (allowed by the rule after event2). That shows C1 is false in the initial state, so C1 does not ""always hold.""

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state the next event is Event1).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially Event2.
- From Event2 the next event must be either Event3 or Event5.
- From Event3 the next must be Event1, Event2, or Event4.
- From Event5 the next must be Event2 or Event4.
- From Event4 the next must be Event1.
- From Event1 the next must be Event3.

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2
- From the initial Event2 we can choose the next event to be Event3 (allowed). That makes the ""next event"" equal to Event3, not Event1 — so C1 is false in that initial state. Because C1 can be false in some reachable state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. C2 asserts that Event2 does happen.

Step 2 — translate the rules as transitions (possible next events):
- 3 -> {4, 5}
- 4 -> {2}
- 2 -> {1, 4}
- 1 -> {5}
- 5 -> {1, 2}

We start with event3.

Step 3 — look for a valid sequence that avoids Event2 (to see if C1 can hold):
- From 3, choosing 4 forces 2 (since 4 -> 2), so avoid 4.
- From 3 choose 5. From 5 choose 1 (avoid 2). From 1 must go to 5. That gives the infinite loop 3,5,1,5,1,5,... which never includes event2 and satisfies all constraints.

Because such a valid sequence exists where Event2 never happens, C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (which asserts Event2 happens) is not forced and is False.

Final answer: False
---
First, restate C2: C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" So C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is equivalent to ""Event2 does happen.""

Now follow the rules starting from the given initial event3:
- After event3, either event4 or event5 must happen.

Branch 1: choose event4.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So in this branch event2 does happen (C2 true in this branch).

Branch 2: choose event5.
- After event5, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - If we choose event2 here, event2 happens (C2 true in this branch).
  - If we choose event1 here, then after event1 event5 must happen, and after that we can again choose event1, producing an infinite loop event5 → event1 → event5 → … in which event2 never occurs. This satisfies all rules while avoiding event2 (so C1 holds in this branch).

Because there is a valid sequence (event3 → event5 → event1 → event5 → …) in which event2 never happens, event2 is not guaranteed. Thus C2 (""Event2 does happen"") is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
We need to check whether ""C2: C1 does not hold"" is true. C1 says ""Event2 does not happen"", so C2 says ""Event2 does happen"".

Start at event3 (given). From event3 either event4 or event5 must occur.

- If 3 → 4, then after 4 event2 must happen, so event2 occurs in that branch.
- If 3 → 5, then after 5 either event1 or event2 must happen. If we pick event2, event2 occurs. But we can instead pick event1; after event1 event5 must happen, and after that we can again pick event1, etc. Thus the sequence 3 → 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ... is allowed and never includes event2.

Because there exists a valid sequence (3 → 5 → 1 → 5 → ...) in which event2 never happens, C1 can hold, so C2 (that event2 does happen) is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- Initially event4 happened.
- By the rule ""after event4, event3 must happen"", the next state is event3.
- C1 says ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every state event3 holds).
- But from a state where event3 just happened, the rule ""after event3, either event1, event2, event4, or event5 must happen"" allows choosing event1 next.
- If event1 happens next, that state is not event3 (and indeed event1 is required to be followed by event4, then event3 later). So there is a reachable next state where event3 does not hold.
- Therefore C1 is false at the next state, so C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at every state from now on event3 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — we must decide whether C1 is true when evaluated at the next state.

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event3 must happen → so the next state is event3.
- After event3, one of {event1, event2, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event1 → event4 must happen.
- After event2 → event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event5 → event3 must happen.
- After event4 → event3 must happen.

Step 3 — produce a concrete trace (counterexample if needed):
- State0: event4 (initial).
- State1: event3 (forced by event4).
- State2: choose event1 (allowed after event3).
  - At State2 event1 holds, but event3 does not hold there.
- So starting at State1 (the ""next"" state), there is a reachable immediate successor (State2) where event3 is false.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false at the next state because there is a permissible transition from that next state to a state where event3 does not hold.
Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially S0: event4. By ""after event4, event3 must happen"" we get S1: event3.
- C2 asserts that from S1 onward, event3 holds at every state. But after event3 the rules allow event1 (among other choices).
- Take the allowed branch: S2: event1. Then by ""after event1, event4 must happen"" we get S3: event4, and then S4: event3.
- S2 and S3 are states where event3 does not hold, so event3 is not true at all future states starting from S1.
Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens (i.e., event1 never happens, and event2 occurs).
We must decide whether C2 can be true given the rules and the initial event.

Step 2 — apply the conditions to the initial event
- Initially event4 happens.
- Rule: after event4, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur (at least once) following the initial event4.

Step 3 — can event1 be avoided while keeping event2?
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen.
- To avoid event1, pick event3 (or event5). If we pick event3, rule: after event3, event2 must happen, returning to event2.
- Thus we can follow the infinite (or finite) loop 4 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... without ever triggering event1.
- Alternatively, choosing event5 also allows choosing {event1, event2, event3} next; we can choose event2 or event3 to avoid event1.

No rule forces event1 to occur at any point; there are choices that keep event1 from ever happening while event2 occurs.

Conclusion
- It is possible for event2 to happen while event1 never happens, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Goal: decide whether C2 (""event1 does not happen"" AND ""event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- From ""after event4, event2 must happen"" we get event2 does happen. So the second part of C2 (event2 happens) is satisfied.
- The first part of C2 is C1: ""event1 does not happen."" Check whether that is guaranteed by the rules. After event2, one of event1, event3, or event5 must happen. That choice is not forced to be event1; event3 or event5 could be chosen instead, so there exist event sequences where event1 never occurs. However, there also exist sequences where event1 does occur (e.g., choose event1 after event2). The rules do not force that event1 never happens.
- Therefore C1 is not entailed by the context (it may be true in some runs and false in others).

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed (not logically entailed) by the given context.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 = (C1 and event2 happens). C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine conditions and trace:
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, event2 must happen. So event2 does happen (necessarily).
- After event2, one of {event1, event3, event5} must happen. That means event1 is allowed to occur after event2 (it's not forbidden).
- Therefore there are valid sequences where event1 does occur (e.g., event4 → event2 → event1 → event4 → ...).

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Although event2 necessarily happens, C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is not guaranteed (there exist valid sequences where event1 does happen).
- So the conjunction C2 is not necessarily true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (in every state). From the rules, initially event1 happens, but immediately after event1 the next event must be either event2 or event5 — so event1 does not necessarily happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false (event1 is not guaranteed always).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state; since C1 is already false (and the next state can be event2 or event5 where event1 need not occur), C2 is also false.
---
Step 1 — interpret the claims
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Meaning: in every state along every possible execution, event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, after the initial transition, from that next state onward event1 always happens.

Step 2 — inspect the transition rules
- From event1 → either event2 or event5.
- From event2 → either event1 or event3.
- From event3 → either event1 or event5.
- From event5 → either event3 or event4.
- From event4 → either event2 or event5.

Step 3 — find a counterexample
Start at the initial event1, choose the following transitions:
event1 → event2 → event3 → event5 → event3 → event5 → ...
This infinite path is allowed by the rules (from event2 → event3, from event3 → event5, from event5 → event3) and never visits event1 after the next state. So in the next state (event2) it is not true that event1 always happens thereafter.

Conclusion
C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says “Event1 always happens” (i.e., at every state event1 occurs).
- Initially event1 happens, but the rules allow the next event to be event2 or event5. So already in the next state event1 need not occur (it could be event2 or event5), so C1 is not true at that next state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state. A concrete counterexample: initial = event1, next = event5 — at that next state event1 does not happen, so “event1 always happens” is false there.

Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""event4 never happens in any possible sequence"") is true.

Rules (key ones):
- Initially event2.
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1: either event3 or event4 must happen.
- After event4: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- (Other rules allow event5 after event3, and then event1/event2/event3 after event5 — not needed here.)

Counterexample trace:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Choose after event2: event1 (allowed).
- After event1: choose event4 (allowed).

This trace (event2 → event1 → event4) shows event4 can occur. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
We ask whether ""C1 always holds"" (C2) given the rules.

Rules (summarized):
- Start: event2 happened.
- 2 -> either 1 or 3.
- 1 -> either 3 or 4.
- 3 -> 5.
- 4 -> either 1 or 2.
- 5 -> either 1, 2, or 3.

A counterexample sequence shows C1 can be violated: choose 2 -> 1 -> 4. This is allowed by the rules (after 2 choose 1, after 1 choose 4). Thus event4 can occur. From 4 you can continue (e.g. 4 -> 1 -> 4) so the sequence is extendable; there is no rule forbidding event4.

Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.

False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event4 does not happen."" C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., event4 never occurs in any allowed execution).
- From the rules: 2 -> {1,3}, 1 -> {3,4}, 3 -> {5}, 4 -> {1,2}, 5 -> {1,2,3}. Initially event2 happened.
- Counterexample execution: start with event2, choose event1 (allowed), then choose event4 (allowed after event1). So event4 does happen in a valid sequence.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says ""event2 always happens"" (i.e., in every future state event2 holds).
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state — so after one transition from the initial state, from that next state it must be true that event2 always happens.
- Initially event3 happened, so the next state must be either event1 or event4 (since after event3, either event1 or event4 must happen).
- From event1 you can go to event4, and from event4 you can go back to event1 (event1 -> event4 -> event1 -> ...), producing an infinite path that never visits event2.
- Therefore, at the next state (e.g. event1) it is not true that event2 always happens, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., at every future step, event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., starting from the state directly after the initial state, event2 will always happen.

Step 2 — examine the model
- Initial event: event3.
- From event3 the next event must be either event1 or event4.
- Transitions of interest: 1 -> {4,5}, 5 -> {1,2}, 4 -> {1,2,5}.

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C2
- If the next state is event1, we can follow event1 -> event5 -> event1 -> event5 -> ... forever (1,5 cycle). Those transitions are allowed (1->5 and 5->1), and this infinite run never contains event2.
- That shows that starting from the next state (when it is event1) it is not guaranteed that event2 will always occur; there is an execution where event2 never happens.
- The same conclusion holds if the next state is event4, since 4 can go to 1 and then enter the above 1–5 loop that avoids event2.

Conclusion
- C1 is not guaranteed in the next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., in every future state/event, event2 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning that immediately after the initial state, C1 is true from that point onward.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules
- Initial event: event3 happened.
- From event3 → either event1 or event4.
- From event1 → either event4 or event5.
- From event4 → either event1, event2, or event5.
- From event5 → either event1 or event2.
- From event2 → one of {event1, event3, event4, event5}.

Step 3 — find a counterexample showing event2 is not guaranteed
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose event3 → event1 (allowed).
- Then choose event1 → event4 (allowed).
- Then choose event4 → event1 (allowed).
This gives the infinite cycle ... → event1 → event4 → event1 → event4 → ... which never includes event2. That shows there is an allowed future where event2 never happens, so C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false from the initial state and also false from the next state(s).

Conclusion
- Since there are allowed next states (e.g., event1 or event4) from which event2 can be avoided forever, C1 does not hold in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens"" — interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs in a permitted sequence, event5 must (eventually) occur.
- C2 asserts C1 always holds (i.e., C1 is true in all allowed sequences).

From the rules we have the possible next-events:
- 2 -> {3,4}
- 3 -> {2,4}
- 4 -> {2,5}
- 5 -> {2}
- initial event = 4

Counterexample sequence that obeys all rules but violates C1:
- Start at 4 (given).
- Choose 4 -> 2 (allowed).
- Choose 2 -> 3 (allowed).
- Choose 3 -> 2 (allowed).
- Repeat 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 ... forever.

In this run event2 occurs many times, yet event5 never occurs. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False, where C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens.""

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event4 happens.
- Rules include:
  - After event2 → either event3 or event4.
  - After event3 → either event2 or event4.
  - After event4 → either event2 or event5.
  - After event5 → event2.
  - (Also: after event1 → either event2, event4, or event5, but event1 never occurs here.)

- To show C1 does not always hold, produce a valid sequence where event2 occurs but event5 never does. Starting from the initial event4:
  - Choose event2 after event4 (allowed).
  - From event2 choose event3.
  - From event3 choose event2.
  - Repeat the 2 ↔ 3 loop indefinitely (each step allowed by the rules).

This sequence contains event2 but never contains event5, so ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start from the initial event4 (given).
- From event4 we may choose event2 (since 4 -> 2 or 5).
- From event2 we may choose event3 (since 2 -> 3 or 4).
- From event3 we may choose event2 (since 3 -> 2 or 4).

This yields the infinite trace 4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, ... in which event2 occurs but event5 never occurs. That is a valid behavior under the given rules, so ""if event2 happens then event5 happens"" does not always hold. Therefore C2 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning in brief:
- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3 we may go to event5 (allowed).
- From event5 we must go to event1.
- From event1 we may go to event3.
- So one possible infinite trace is: 3 → 5 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 1 → ... which never includes event2.

This trace is consistent with all given successor constraints and never makes C1 (event2 eventually happens) true, so C1 is not guaranteed and therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
First, what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point an event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — temporally, this is eventually(eventually(event2)), which is equivalent to eventually(event2). So C2 is just another way of claiming that event2 will occur at some future point.

Examine the rules (deduplicated):
- Initially: event3 occurs.
- 1 -> {2,3,4,5}
- 2 -> {3,4,5}
- 3 -> {2,5}
- 4 -> {1,5}
- 5 -> {1}

Can event2 be avoided forever? Yes. From the initial event3, choose the following nondeterministic replies each time to avoid 2:
3 -> 5 (allowed),
5 -> 1 (forced),
1 -> 3 (allowed, avoid 2),
then 3 -> 5 again, and repeat.

This yields an infinite trace 3,5,1,3,5,1,... that never contains event2. Therefore event2 does not necessarily eventually happen; C1 is not guaranteed, and hence C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future step an occurrence of event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future step it will be true that event2 eventually happens).
- In temporal logic terms C2 = F(F event2). But F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1.

Step 2 — examine the transition rules
- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3 the next event can be event2 or event5 (3 -> {2,5}).
- From event5 the next must be event1 (5 -> 1).
- From event1 the next can be 2,3,4,5 (1 -> {2,3,4,5}), etc.

Step 3 — can event2 ever occur?
- From the initial event3 there is a direct allowed transition to event2, so there exists a future in which event2 occurs (e.g., 3 -> 2).
- Therefore C1 holds (there is a possible future where event2 eventually happens).
- Since C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 holds as well.

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the rules.

- C1 is ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" (so C2 requires that event2 inevitably occurs).

From the rules: initially event5 → event3. From event3 the next event must be either event2 or event5. It is allowed to always choose event5 after event3, yielding the infinite run: 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... In that run event2 never occurs, so event2 is not guaranteed to eventually happen. Thus C1 does not hold in all possible executions, and therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
You ask whether C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the rules. Step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (So C2 effectively requires that event2 does occur, and thus C1 as well.)

2. Examine the rules and initial condition:
   - Initially event5 occurs.
   - After 5, event3 must happen: 5 → 3.
   - After 3, either 2 or 5 must happen: 3 → {2, 5}.
   - After 2, one of {1, 3, 5} must happen.
   - After 1, 5 must happen.
   - After 4, one of {1, 2, 5} must happen.

3. Trace possible sequences from the start:
   - Start: 5 → 3.
   - From 3 we may choose 2 (then event2 happens) or choose 5.
   - If we always choose 5 at the 3-step, the execution can loop: 5 → 3 → 5 → 3 → 5 → ... forever, never taking the transition to 2.

4. Conclusion:
   - Because there is a valid execution that never reaches event2, event2 is not guaranteed to eventually happen. Thus C1 is not necessarily true.
   - Since C1 can fail, C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is also not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (i.e. event2 eventually happens, and event2 happens)

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially: event5 occurs.
- After event5: event3 must occur.
- After event3: either event2 or event5 must occur (nondeterministic choice).
- After event2: either event1, event3, or event5 must occur.
- After event1: event5 must occur.
- After event4: either event1, event2, or event5 must occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event5 we get event3. From event3 there is a choice: event2 or event5.
- It is possible to choose event5 after event3, which leads back to event3, and so on: event5 → event3 → event5 → event3 → ...
- That infinite loop never produces event2. So there exists an execution in which event2 never happens.

Step 4 — conclusion about the hypotheses
- Because there's an allowed execution where event2 never occurs, ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed/true in all runs. Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is also false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event4 happens, then event4 happens."" This is a tautology and thus holds.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event5 happens."" So C2 is true only if event5 must occur given the rules.
- From the rules we can follow a sequence that avoids event5 forever: start at event3 (given), choose event2 next (allowed), then choose event3 next (allowed), and repeat: 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... This infinite loop never includes event5.
- Since there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which event5 never happens, event5 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is not entailed.

Hence C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event4 happens."" (a tautology — always true.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event5 happens."" So we need C1 to be true and event5 to occur at some point.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, either event2 or event5 must happen.
- (Other transitions: 2 → {3,4,5}; 4 → {1,3}; 5 → 3; 1 → {2,4,5}.)

Step 3 — trace sequences
- From the initial event3, one allowed next event is event5 (since after event3 either event2 or event5 must happen). So there is a valid sequence in which event5 occurs immediately.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is trivially true. Event5 can occur from the initial event3. Therefore the conjunction C2 is satisfiable and can be true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event4 happens, then event4 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 always holds.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event5 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to ""event5 happens"" (since C1 is always true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transitions
- Initially event3.
- From 3 → either 2 or 5.
- From 2 → either 3, 4, or 5.
- From 4 → either 1 or 3.
- From 5 → 3.
- From 1 → either 2, 4, or 5.

Step 3 — trace a counterexample sequence
- Start at 3, choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2, choose 3 (allowed).
- Repeat: 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... forever.

This infinite sequence respects all given rules and never contains event5.

Conclusion
- Event5 is not guaranteed to occur, so C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 asserts ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- From the facts: after event1 (which did happen initially) either event2 or event4 must happen next. That makes event2 possible but not guaranteed.
- C2 is the negation of C1 (""C1 does not hold""). Since the next state could be event2 or event4, we cannot conclude C1 is false for sure.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the given conditions, so C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" C2 asserts the negation of C1.
- From the facts: after initial event1, either event2 or event4 must happen. That means event2 is a possible next event but not guaranteed.
- Because event2 can happen, C1 is possible. C2 (""C1 does not hold"") would only be true if event2 were impossible; it is not.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed and is false as a universal claim (a counterexample: choose event2 next).
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened. After event1 either event2 or event4 must occur next.
- That means event2 is a possible next event (it is not ruled out).
- C1 asserts event2 happens next; this is possible but not guaranteed.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 does not happen next). Since event2 could happen, C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We start at event3. From the rules:
- 3 can go to {1,2,4,5}
- 1 can go to {2,3,5}
- 2 can go to {3,4}
- 4 can go to {1,2,5}
- 5 can go to {2,4}

There is a cycle that avoids event5: 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ... . At each step the choices used (3→1, 1→2, 2→3) are allowed and never include 5, so it’s possible to run forever without ever encountering event5. Therefore event5 is not guaranteed to eventually happen on all runs, so C2 is False.

False
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the description the transitions are:
  1 -> {2,3,5}
  2 -> {3,4}
  3 -> {1,2,4,5}
  4 -> {1,2,5}
  5 -> {2,4}
- Initially event3 occurs. To avoid event5, from 3 choose 1 (allowed), from 1 choose 2 (allowed), from 2 choose 3 (allowed). This yields the cycle 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.
- That cycle contains no event5, so there is an infinite execution in which event5 never happens.
- Therefore ""Event5 eventually happens"" is not guaranteed on all runs, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
Step 1 — identify initial condition:
- Initially event3 occurs.

Step 2 — summarize transitions (after X -> possible next events):
- 1 -> {2,3,5}
- 2 -> {3,4}
- 3 -> {1,2,4,5}
- 4 -> {1,2,5}
- 5 -> {2,4}

Step 3 — look for a possible infinite run that avoids event5:
- From 3, choose 2 (allowed).
- From 2, choose 3 (allowed).
- Repeat 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 ... forever.
This infinite path never includes event5.

Since there exists a valid run starting from the initial state that never reaches event5, the statement ""event5 eventually happens"" does not hold on all runs. Therefore C2 is False.

Reasoning summary:
- Initially event5 happens (state s0).
- From event5, the next state s1 must be either event2 or event3 (so event5 cannot be s1). Therefore C1 (""event5 happens in the next state"") is false at s0.
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. that event5 will happen in s2 (two steps from s0). That is not guaranteed: e.g. take s1 = event2 (allowed), then s2 = event1 (allowed from event2). In that run s2 is event1, not event5, so C2 is false.
- Because a permitted sequence violates C2, it is not entailed by the rules.
---
False

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event5 happens. By the rule for event5, the next state must be either event2 or event3.
- C1 says ""event5 happens in the next state"" (i.e. at time1). That is not forced because from event5 the next state can be event2 or event3, so C1 is already not guaranteed.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. at time1, event5 will happen at time2). From time1 = event2 we can choose time2 = event1 (allowed by the rule after event2), so event5 does not have to occur at time2. Thus C1 need not hold at time1.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed; the correct answer is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happens (state0).
- From event5, the rules force the next state (state1) to be either event2 or event3 — so C1 (""event5 happens in the next state"", i.e. in state1) is already not guaranteed.
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state — meaning: in state1, the following state (state2) must be event5.
- Consider the branch state1 = event2 (allowed). After event2, the next state may be event1, event3, or event5. If we choose event1 for state2 (allowed), then state1's next is event1, not event5 — so C1 does not hold in state1, and thus C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event5 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every possible sequence from the initial situation, C1 is true)

Step 2 — list the rules (condensed):
- Initially: event5 happens.
- After event5: event4 must happen.
- After event4: one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen.
- After event2: event1 must happen.
- After event3: one of {event1, event4, event5} must happen.
- After event1: one of {event2, event3, event4} must happen.

Step 3 — find a counterexample sequence:
- Start: event5 (given).
- After event5 → event4 (must).
- After event4, choose event5 (allowed).
- After event5 → event4 (must).
- Repeat: event5 → event4 → event5 → ... indefinitely.

In this infinite trace, event5 occurred (initially), but event1 never occurs. Since there exists a permitted sequence where event1 does not happen, C1 (""Event1 happens and event5 happens"") does not hold on all possible sequences.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event5 happens.""

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event5 happens (given), so event5 is true.
- After event5, event4 must happen. So we get event5 → event4.
- After event4, one of {event2, event3, event5} must happen. It is allowed to choose event5.
- If we choose event5, then after that event4 must happen again, so we can have the cycle ... → event5 → event4 → event5 → event4 → ...
- This cycle is consistent with all the given rules and never requires event1 to occur.
- Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the rules where event1 never happens (while event5 does), C1 is not guaranteed to hold in every possible execution.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

- Build a valid sequence that respects all rules but never produces event1: start with event5 (given) → event4 (forced) → choose event5 (allowed) → event4 → event5 → ... This infinite alternation e5,e4,e5,e4... satisfies all ""must"" and ""either"" requirements but never includes event1.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start is event1.
- From the rules: 1 -> {2,4}, 2 -> {1,3,4,5}, 4 -> {1,2,3}, 3 -> {1,2,4,5}, 5 -> {3,4}.
- There exists a valid infinite path that never visits event3 or event5, for example: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> ... (1->4, 4->2, 2->1 are all allowed).
- Because event3 is not inevitable (there are runs that avoid it) and event5 is not inevitable, the conjunction ""event5 happens and event3 eventually happens"" (C2) is not entailed by the premises.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- From event1 the rules allow either event2 or event4 next.
- From event2 the rules allow event1 or event4 (as well as event3 or event5, but those are optional).
- From event4 the rules allow event1 or event2 (as well as event3, but again optional).

Therefore there is a valid infinite trace that never visits event3 or event5, for example:
event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... 
This trace always uses the allowed choices (1→2, 2→1) and thus avoids event3 and event5 forever.

Because C2 requires that event5 happens and event3 eventually happens, and we have a permitted trace where neither occurs, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Start at event1. From event1 the next event must be either event2 or event4.
- Both event2 and event4 have allowed successors that stay within the set {event1, event2, event4} (2 → {1,4} is allowed by choosing 1 or 4; 4 → {1,2} is allowed by choosing 1 or 2).
- Therefore there is a valid infinite sequence that stays entirely in {event1, event2, event4} (for example: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... or 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ...), never visiting event3 or event5.
- Thus event3 is not guaranteed to eventually happen (C1 can be false), and event5 need not happen. Hence the conjunction ""event5 happens and event3 eventually happens"" (C2) is not guaranteed.

So C2 is False."

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
1. Initially event3 happened.
2. The rules state that after event3 no other events can happen. That fixes the entire run: only event3 occurs and nothing else can occur afterward.
3. C1 asserts “event2 happens or event4 happens.” Neither event2 nor event4 occurs in the fixed run (only event3 does), so C1 is false.
4. C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Since C1 is already false in the actual run, C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event2 happens or Event4 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (in every possible sequence).
- Initially Event3 happens. The rules state that after Event3 no other events can happen, so the sequence stops with only Event3.
- In that actual (and only) possible sequence, neither Event2 nor Event4 occurs, so C1 is false.
- Since C1 does not hold, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or Event4 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible execution/trace).

Given the context: initially Event3 happens, and after Event3 no other events can happen. So the only execution is that Event3 occurs and nothing else. In that execution neither Event2 nor Event4 happens, so C1 is false there. Hence C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened.
- The rules state: after event4, event1 must happen. That makes the next state event1 (not event5).
- Therefore C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false in the initial situation.
- C2 claims C1 always holds (i.e., in all states). Since C1 is already false in the initial step, C2 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 states: ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- C2 states: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every reachable state, the next state has event5.
- From the given rules: initially event4 happened. After event4, event1 must happen (deterministic).
- Therefore, from the initial state the next state is event1, not event5, so C1 is false in the initial state.
- Since C1 is not true in that reachable state, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context the transition rules are:
  - after 2 → {3,4,5}
  - after 3 → {1,2,4}
  - after 4 → {1}
  - after 5 → {1,3,4}
  - after 1 → {4,5}
- Initially event4 happened. So the next state must follow the ""after 4"" rule.
- ""After 4 → {1}"" forces event1 in the next state. Event5 cannot occur in that next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false from the initial situation, and C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false as well.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen"" forces the next state to be event3 or event4. Therefore event5 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 (event5 happens in the next state) is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state — i.e. that in the next state, event5 happens in the following state. But there is no rule that allows event5 to occur after event3 or event4 (or after any event given), so event5 cannot occur at that later state either. Hence C2 is false.
---
Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- From the rule ""After event2, either event3 or event4 must happen,"" the next event can only be event3 or event4. So C1 (""Event5 happens in the next state"") is false in the current state.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state,"" i.e., that in the next state the following state will have event5 (two steps from the start). Consider both possible next steps:
  - If next is event3, then from event3 the successor must be event1 or event2.
  - If next is event4, then from event4 the successor must be event1 or event3.
- In none of these cases can event5 occur two steps from the start. There is no rule allowing any event to be followed by event5, so event5 cannot occur in the next state or the state after that.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 means “event5 happens in the next state (s1)”. C2 means “at the next state (s1) it is true that event5 happens in that state's next state (s2)”.
- Initially event2 happened, and the rule “after event2, either event3 or event4 must happen” forces s1 to be event3 or event4. So event5 cannot occur at s1 — C1 is false.
- From s1 (event3 or event4), the allowed successors are: after event3 → event1 or event2; after event4 → event1 or event3. None allow event5, and no rule produces event5 from any event. So event5 cannot occur at s2 either, hence C1 is false at s1 and C2 is false.
- Therefore C2 is False."

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 has happened.
- From event3 the allowed next events are event1, event2, or event5.
- If we choose event1, then the rules force event3 next (1 -> 3).
- Thus there is a valid infinite trace 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> ... that never visits event2.
- Because a trace exists in which event2 never occurs, ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
We need to decide whether ""C1 does not hold"" is true. C1 says ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e. in every possible sequence from the initial state, event2 will occur at some point). C2 is the negation: there is a valid sequence starting from the initial event where event2 never occurs.

Given the rules:
- Initially event3.
- From event3: next is one of {event1, event2, event5}.
- From event1: next must be event3.
- From event5: next is one of {event2, event4}.
- From event4: next is one of {event1, event5}.

We can exhibit a valid infinite sequence that never includes event2: choose event1 whenever leaving event3. That yields the loop
3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ...
Every step follows the allowed transitions, and event2 never appears.

Therefore C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.
---
Reasoning:
- Start at event3.
- From event3 we may choose event1 (since after event3 either event1, event2, or event5 must happen).
- After event1, event3 must happen. So we can loop: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ...
- This infinite loop never includes event2, so there is a valid execution where event2 never happens.

Therefore C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Votes: {'True': 2, 'False': 1}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true because event2 happened initially.
- C2 requires event1 to happen as well. The rules allow a trace that never produces event1: start at event2, choose event4 next, then choose event2 from event4, then event4 again, and so on (2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ...). This infinite trace respects the given ""either/or"" rules but never includes event1.
- Therefore event1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (Event1 happens and C1 holds) does not follow.
---
Reasoning:

- Initially event2 has happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true already.
- From event2 the rules allow either event3 or event4 next.
- From event4 the rules allow either event2 or event5 next.
- Therefore there is a valid infinite trace that stays in the cycle event2 → event4 → event2 → event4 → ... and never takes any branch that produces event1.
- Because event1 is not forced on every possible trace (we can avoid it by always choosing the event2↔event4 cycle), ""event1 happens"" is not guaranteed.
- C2 requires both ""event1 happens"" and C1. Although C1 holds, event1 need not occur, so C2 does not hold in general.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true because Event2 already happens initially.
- C2 requires Event1 happens (in addition to C1). The rules allow a run that never reaches Event1: from the initial Event2 choose Event4, then from Event4 choose Event2, and repeat (2 → 4 → 2 → 4 → ...). This infinite loop satisfies all given ""after ..."" constraints but never produces Event1.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are given rules about which events must follow others and the initial fact that event5 happened.

Hypotheses:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: C1 does not hold — i.e. Event1 does happen.

We ask whether C2 is true (i.e. whether event1 must occur).

Reasoning:
1. Initially event5 happened. From ""After event5, event3 must happen"" we get event3.
2. From ""After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" we may choose event2 instead of event1.
3. From ""After event2, either event1 or event5 must happen"" we can choose event5.
4. That returns us to event5, which forces event3, and the cycle 5 → 3 → 2 → 5 can repeat indefinitely without ever taking event1.

Since there is a valid sequence consistent with all rules in which event1 never occurs, C1 can hold. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is not guaranteed — C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is ""Event1 does not happen."" C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e. ""Event1 happens"").
- From the context: initially event5 happens, and after event5 event3 must happen. After event3 we have a choice: event1 or event2.
- If after event3 we always choose event2, then after event2 we can choose event5, which forces event3 again, and so on. This yields a valid infinite loop E5 → E3 → E2 → E5 → E3 → ... in which Event1 never happens, so C1 can hold.
- Because there exists a valid sequence where Event1 never happens, C1 is not ruled out; therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed true.

Thus C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, event3 must happen, so event3 occurs.
- After event3 either event1 or event2 must happen. To avoid event1, pick event2.
- After event2 either event1 or event5 must happen. To avoid event1 again, pick event5.
- After that event5 forces event3 again, and the same choices repeat: 5 → 3 → 2 → 5 → ...
This infinite loop never requires event1 to occur, so ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is consistent with the rules. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. C1 is false) is not true."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event2 happens or event2 happens"") is equivalent to ""Event2 happens."" That is true because the context states initially event2 happened.
- C2 requires both ""Event1 happens"" and C1. So we need Event1 to be guaranteed.
- From the transitions: starting at event2 you must go to either event3 or event5. Both of those paths lead to event5 eventually. From event5 you may go to event1, event2, or event3 — event1 is only one possible option, not forced.
- Therefore Event1 is not guaranteed by the rules (it is possible but not necessary). Since C2 requires Event1 to hold, C2 is not entailed.

Thus C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" which simplifies to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 = ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" so C2 requires Event1 to occur (and Event2).

Step 2 — examine conditions / initial fact:
- Initially Event2 happened, so C1 is true.
- From Event2 the rules allow either Event3 or Event5 next (nondeterministically).
- No rule forces Event1 to ever occur; Event1 can only occur after Event5 (where after Event5 one of Event1, Event2, or Event3 must happen), but reaching Event5 is not guaranteed (branches may avoid it), and even if Event5 occurs, Event1 is only one possible successor, not required.

Step 3 — counterexample showing C2 not guaranteed:
- Start: Event2 (given).
- Choose the branch Event2 → Event3 → Event4 → Event5 → choose successors that are not Event1 (e.g. Event2 or Event3), and continue. This valid path never requires Event1 to happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 is true, but Event1 is not entailed by the premises, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is true (tautologically, and event2 also happens initially).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 holds exactly if event1 happens (since C1 is already true).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initial event: event2.
- Allowed successors:
  - 1 -> {2,3,4,5}
  - 2 -> {3,5}
  - 3 -> {4,5}
  - 4 -> {5}
  - 5 -> {1,2,3}

Step 3 — check whether event1 must occur
- From the initial event2, one allowed path is: 2 -> 5 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 -> ... 
  (always choose 2 after 5 and always choose 5 after 2). This infinite path obeys all transition rules and never includes event1.
- Therefore event1 is not forced to occur in every allowed execution.

Conclusion
- C1 is true, but C2 requires event1 which is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: event4 has happened.
- Rules give transitions: 4 -> 5; 5 -> {2,4}; 2 -> {1,3}; 1 -> {2,3}; 3 -> 4.
- Assume C1: event3 never happens. That bans any transition that would produce event3.
- With 3 banned, whenever 5 occurs you may choose 4 (allowed) or 2; whenever 2 occurs you must choose 1 (since 3 is banned); whenever 1 occurs you must choose 2 (since 3 is banned). So 2 and 1 would force an alternating 2-1 cycle if you ever go that way.
- But nothing forces you to ever choose 2 at a 5. You can always choose 4 at each occurrence of 5, producing the infinite valid sequence 4,5,4,5,... which contains no event3 and never contains event2.
- Therefore C1 does not imply event2 happens. C2 is False.
---
We want to know whether ""If event3 does not happen (C1), then event2 happens"" (C2) must hold given the rules.

Steps / reasoning:
- Initially event4 happens.
- Rule: after event4, event5 must happen. So event5 will occur.
- Rule: after event5, either event2 or event4 must happen. If we choose event4, that satisfies the rule.
- Then from that event4, event5 must happen again, and we can again choose event4 after it.
- This yields a valid infinite sequence: event4 → event5 → event4 → event5 → ... in which event3 never occurs and event2 never occurs.
- No rule forces event2 to occur in that sequence (event3 is absent by assumption, and choosing event4 after each event5 always satisfies the ""either"" choice).

Thus there exists a scenario where C1 holds (event3 does not happen) but event2 does not happen. Therefore the implication C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened, so event5 must happen (rule: after event4 → event5).
- After that event5 must be followed by either event2 or event4.
- Choose event4 repeatedly: 4 → 5 → 4 → 5 → ... This satisfies all given rules (after 4 comes 5, after 5 we choose 4).
- In that infinite trace event3 never happens and event2 never occurs.

Thus C1 (event3 does not happen) can hold while event2 does not happen, so ""If C1 then event2"" is not guaranteed."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 always happens."" (i.e., in every possible continuation from the initial state, event5 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event5 happens."" So C2 requires C1 to be true (event5 always happens) and that event5 actually happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace possible sequences:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be event2, event4, or event5.
- If event2 happens, then ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — the sequence ends at 1 → 2, and event5 never occurs on that run.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Because there is a permitted run (1 → 2) in which event5 does not occur, C1 (""event5 always happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 (C1 and event5 happens) is false as well.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event5 always happens"" means on every possible continuation from the initial state, event5 will (at some point) occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event5 happens"" requires both that event5 is guaranteed in all executions (C1) and that event5 indeed happens (in the actual execution).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- From event1 the next event must be one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- After event2, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Other transition rules allow more events but are irrelevant if event2 is chosen.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample:
- From the initial event1, choose event2 next. That yields the sequence 1 → 2 and then termination. In this execution event5 never occurs.
- Because there exists at least one possible execution where event5 does not occur, C1 (""event5 always happens"") is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires C1 to hold. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event5 always happens (i.e., in every possible run/event sequence).
- C2: C1 holds and event5 happens (so C2 requires C1 to be true).

Step 2 — examine conditions and trace sequences:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be one of {event2, event4, event5}.
- If after event1 we choose event2, then by ""after event2, no other events can happen"" the sequence ends (1 → 2) and event5 never occurs in that run.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid run (1 → 2) in which event5 does not occur, event5 is not guaranteed to always happen. Thus C1 is false, and therefore C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

Reasoning, step by step:

- Interpret C1 as ""event1 holds in the next state"" and C2 as ""eventually there is a state where C1 holds"" (i.e. at some future time the following state is event1).
- From the rules: 1 -> {2,4,5}; 2 -> {1,3,5}; 3 -> {1,2}; 4 -> {2,3,5}; 5 -> {2,3}.
- Starting from the initial event1, choose the allowed transitions 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... . These are all allowed moves (2 -> 3 and 3 -> 2 are allowed), and this infinite path never returns to event1.
- On that path, C1 never holds (there is never a next state that is event1), so C1 does not eventually hold in all possible behaviors.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the rules; C2 is False.

- From the rule ""After event5, event4 must happen"" we conclude event4 happens.
- From the rule ""After event4, event3 must happen"" we conclude event3 happens.
- That contradicts C1 (""Event3 does not happen""), so C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and event4 to happen). Although event4 does happen, C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Answer: False

- C2: C1 holds and event4 happens (i.e., event3 does not happen AND event4 happens).

Step 2 — examine the rules and initial condition:
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event4, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event5 we get event4 (since 5 → 4).
- From that event4 we get event3 (since 4 → 3).
- Therefore event3 does happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 (event3 does not happen) is false.
- Hence C2 (C1 and event4) is false as well.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event5 happens or event4 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., neither event5 nor event4 happens).

Step 2 — use the facts:
- The context states: ""Initially, event5 happened."" So event5 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Since event5 happens, C1 is true (event5 ∨ event4 is true).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 = (event4 eventually happens) OR (event3 happens).
- Initial event is event1. After event1, the rules force one of event3, event4, or event5 to occur.
  - If event3 occurs immediately, C2 is satisfied.
  - If event4 occurs immediately, C2 is satisfied.
  - If event5 occurs, then after event5 the rules force one of event2, event3, or event4.
    - If event3 or event4 occurs next, C2 is satisfied.
    - If event2 occurs, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 next, so C2 is satisfied.
- There is no possible branch starting from event1 that avoids both event3 and event4 indefinitely.

Therefore C2 must hold. True.
---
First identify the rules (transitions) implied by the context:
- start: event1 happens.
- from 1 → {3, 4, 5}
- from 3 → {1, 2, 4, 5}
- from 4 → {1, 2, 3, 5}
- from 5 → {2, 3, 4}
- from 2 → {3} (i.e. after 2, 3 must happen)

Hypotheses:
- C1: “Event4 eventually happens.”
- C2: “C1 holds OR event3 happens.” (i.e. either 4 eventually occurs or 3 occurs)

We must check whether, from the initial state, every possible run satisfies C2 (i.e. whether it is impossible to avoid both 3 ever and 4 ever).

Examine possible choices from the initial event1:
- If from 1 we choose 3 → event3 happens, so C2 is satisfied.
- If from 1 we choose 4 → event4 happens, so C2 is satisfied.
- If from 1 we choose 5 → next from 5 we can choose 2,3, or 4.
  - If 5 → 3 or 5 → 4, then 3 or 4 happens and C2 is satisfied.
  - If 5 → 2, then from 2 we must go to 3, so 3 happens and C2 is satisfied.

There is no path that avoids both event3 and event4 forever. Therefore in all runs starting from event1, either event4 eventually occurs or event3 occurs. Hence C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Reasoning:
- Start at event1. From event1 the next event must be one of {3,4,5}.
- If the next event is 3, then ""event3 happens"" is true, so C2 holds.
- If the next event is 4, then event4 eventually happens, so C1 holds and thus C2 holds.
- If the next event is 5, the next event after 5 must be one of {2,3,4}.
  - If it is 3 or 4, we again have C2.
  - If it is 2, then after 2 the only possible next event is 3, so event3 happens and C2 holds.

In every possible sequence from the given rules, either event4 occurs or event3 occurs. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts two things: (a) event3 happens, and (b) C1 holds, where C1 is ""if event5 happens then event3 happens"".
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the context rules.

Step 2 — key rules from the context
- Initially event4 happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event1 or event3, no other events can happen.
- No rule produces event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event4, either choose event2 or event5.
  - If event4 → event2, then event2 → event5, then event5 → event4, and the cycle repeats.
  - If event4 → event5 directly, then event5 → event4, and the cycle repeats.
- In every possible branch event5 does occur, and the system cycles among 4,2,5.
- There is no rule that causes event3 to occur at any point.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""if event5 happens then event3 happens"") is false: we have event5 occurring while event3 never occurs (counterexample).
- Therefore C2 (event3 happens and C1 holds) is false: event3 does not happen and C1 does not hold.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") follows from the given conditions.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially event4 has happened.
- After event4, either event2 or event5 must happen.
- After event2, event5 must happen.
- After event5, event4 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal if it ever occurs)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal if it ever occurs)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start at event4. By the rule for event4, the next event must be either event2 or event5.
- If event2 occurs, then event5 must follow; after that event5 forces event4, so we return to event4. That yields a cycle 4 → 2 → 5 → 4 → ...
- If event5 occurs directly from event4, it forces event4 next, so again we get 4 → 5 → 4 → ...
- No rule allows event3 (or event1) to occur at any point in these sequences; nothing forces or enables event3 from the reachable events. So in all reachable continuations starting from the initial event4, event3 never occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""If event5 happens, then event3 happens"") is not implied by the rules: there are reachable sequences where event5 happens but event3 does not (e.g., 4 → 5 → 4 → ...).
- Therefore C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is false: event3 does not happen in the reachable behavior and C1 does not hold.

False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 says ""Event5 happens in the next state.""
- From the context: ""Initially, event3 happened"" and ""After event3, event2 must happen.""
- Therefore the next state must be event2, so event5 cannot happen in the next state. C1 is false.
- C2 asserts ""Event5 happens and C1 holds"" (which is just event5 happening in the next state), so C2 is also false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event5 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event5 happens and C1 holds (so C2 is equivalent to ""Event5 happens in the next state"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event2 must happen"" applies (stated twice).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event3, the very next event must be event2 (because after event3, event2 must happen).
- Therefore the next state cannot be event5.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event5 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event5 happens and C1 holds (so C2 is true exactly when Event5 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the rules and trace from the initial state:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen → the next state is event2.
- After event2, the next state must be one of {event1, event3, event4} — event5 is not an option.
- After event1 the next must be event2 or event3 (no event5).
- After event4 the next must be event3 (no event5).
- After event3 the next must be event2 (no event5).
- The only rule mentioning event5 is “after event5, event3 must happen,” which does not introduce event5 anywhere.

Since none of the allowed transitions from the initial event3 can lead to event5, Event5 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false, and C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 is ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

From the context we can pick a concrete allowed trace: event4 → event1. In that trace:
- event5 does not occur, so C1 is true in that trace (the implication event5 → event1 is vacuously true).
- event2 does not occur.

Thus there exists a model/trace where C1 holds but event2 does not. Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is not guaranteed by the context. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- After event4 the next event must be one of {event1, event2, event3, event5}.
- Consider the concrete allowed sequence: event4 then event1. That sequence is consistent with the rules (after event1 no further events).
- In that sequence event5 does not occur, so the implication ""if event5 happens then event1 happens"" (C1) is vacuously true.
- But event2 does not happen in that sequence.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rules say that after event2 no other events can happen, so the system is stuck at event2 and no transitions occur.
- C1 asserts that event3 happens in the next state; that cannot be true because there is no next event after event2.
- Therefore C1 never becomes true, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (i.e., at the immediate next step an event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there is some future moment where C1 is true).

Step 2 — relevant conditions from the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is a dead end)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is also a dead end)
- Other rules (after event1, after event4, after event5) are irrelevant if we are stuck at event2 initially.

Step 3 — trace/reasoning
- The system starts with event2 having happened.
- Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" there are no next states with any events after that initial event2.
- Therefore there is never a next state in which event3 occurs.
- So C1 is false now and will never become true; hence C1 never eventually holds.

Final answer
False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Hypothesis C1 states: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" C2 states: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point there is a state whose next state has event3).
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. That means the run terminates immediately after the initial event2—there is no next state with any event.
- Therefore event3 cannot occur in the next state (C1 is false at the initial point), and there are no future points at which C1 could become true.
- Hence C2 is false."

Reasoning:
- Start: event3 has happened.
- From event3 you may go to 2, 4, or 5.
- Consider the choices: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 and repeat. Check each step against the rules:
  - 3 -> 2 is allowed (after 3: {2,4,5}).
  - 2 -> 1 is allowed (after 2: {1,3,5}).
  - 1 -> 4 is required/allowed (after 1: 4).
  - 4 -> 3 is allowed (after 4: {1,2,3}).
- This yields an infinite cycle 3,2,1,4,3,2,1,4,... that never includes event5.

Since there exists a valid sequence in which event5 never happens, C1 (""event3 happens and event5 happens"") does not hold on all executions. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
We need to check whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the transition rules.

- C1 says: Event3 happens and event5 happens.
  - Event3 does happen initially (given).
  - So C1 will hold on a run only if event5 also occurs at some point on that run.

- We must decide whether every possible run (sequence of allowed events) necessarily includes event5.

Find a counterexample run that avoids event5:

1. Start: event3 (given).
2. From event3, choose event2 (allowed: 2,4,5).
3. From event2, choose event1 (allowed: 1,3,5).
4. From event1, event4 must happen.
5. From event4, choose event1 again (allowed: 1,2,3).
6. Repeat the 1 → 4 → 1 cycle forever.

This infinite run is: 3 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... and it never contains event5. Since there exists at least one valid run where event5 never occurs, C1 is not guaranteed to hold on all runs.

Therefore C2 is False. Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (counterexample):
- Initially event3 happens.
- From event3 choose event2 (allowed: after 3 → 2,4,5).
- From event2 choose event1 (allowed: after 2 → 1,3,5).
- After event1 must go to event4 (after 1 → 4).
- From event4 choose event1 (allowed: after 4 → 1,2,3).

That yields the infinite loop 3 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 1 → 4 → ... which never includes event5. Thus C1 (""event3 and event5 happen"") does not hold in all possible runs, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 says eventually C1 holds, i.e. at some point both event3 and event4 have happened.
- Initially event3 has already happened, so we only need event4 to occur later.
- Look at the allowed transitions: after event1 → event2; after event2 → {event1, event3, event5}; after event3 → {event2, event5}; after event4 → {event3, event5}; after event5 → terminal (no further events).
- No rule allows any event to be followed by event4, and event4 did not occur initially. Therefore event4 is unreachable in all future sequences.
- Since event4 can never happen, the conjunction ""event3 and event4"" can never be satisfied later.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 has happened (so event3 is true at the start).
- From the rules: after event3 the next event must be either event2 or event5. After event5 no further events can occur (terminal).
- No rule allows event4 to occur after any of the possible events (1,2,3,5). The only rule mentioning event4 is what happens after event4 (i.e., afterwards 3 or 5), which does not permit reaching event4 in the first place.
- Therefore event4 can never occur starting from the given initial event3. C1 (event3 and event4 both happen) can never become true, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
We want to know whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true. C1 is ""Event3 happens and event4 happens.""

Given:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- Transition rules:
  - After event1 → event2 must happen.
  - After event2 → event1 or event3 or event5 must happen.
  - After event3 → event2 or event5 must happen.
  - After event4 → event3 or event5 must happen.
  - After event5 → no further events.

Key observation: No rule allows event4 to occur after any event (event4 does not appear as an allowed successor of event1, event2, event3, or event5). The only way event4 could hold is if it were initial, but the initial event is event3 only. Therefore event4 can never occur in any future sequence.

Since event4 never happens, C1 (""event3 happens and event4 happens"") cannot become true, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C1 = (event5 and event4). C2 = “C1 holds in the next state” (i.e. in the state immediately after the current one).
- Rules (relevant): Initially event3. After event3, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, either event1 or event5 must happen. After event5, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen.
- Trace from the initial state (event3):
  - Next state (immediately after initial): event1 must happen (because after event3 → event1).
  - That next state therefore contains event1, not event5 and event4.
- To get event4 you would need to be one more step after an event5 (event2 → event5 → event4), so event5 and event4 cannot both hold in the immediate next state after the initial event3.

Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to include event1.
- C1 requires the next state to have both event5 and event4. Nothing in the rules forces event4 and event5 to occur in that next state; instead the next state must include event1 (and after that event2 must happen). Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis asks whether ""Event5 happens and event4 happens"" (C1) holds in the next state (C2).
- Initially event3 happened. The rule ""After event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 in the next state.
- That next state therefore contains event1. Under the usual interpretation here (one event per state / the rule ""must happen"" determines the next event), the next state cannot simultaneously be event4 and event5.
- There is no rule forcing event4 or event5 to happen immediately after the initial event3, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event5 occurs. From event5 the next state can be either event1 or event2.
- C2 asserts that in that next state, event3 will eventually occur.
- If the next state is event1, then event1 → event3 (so event3 does occur afterward), so C1 holds in that branch.
- If the next state is event2, then event2 → event4, and from event4 the system may choose event2 again (event4 → event2). This yields an infinite loop event2 → event4 → event2 → ... with no event3 ever occurring. Thus from the next state = event2, event3 is not guaranteed to eventually happen.
- Because there is a possible next-state (event2) in which event3 may never occur, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the claim:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future step).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — reads as: in the state immediately after the initial state, it is guaranteed that event3 will eventually occur (i.e., in all continuations from that next state, event3 occurs at some later time).

Step 2 — list the transition constraints (deduplicated):
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5 → event1 or event2.
- After event1 → event3.
- After event3 → event4 or event5.
- After event4 → event2 or event3 or event5.
- After event2 → event4.

Step 3 — examine possible next states and their futures:
- If the next state is event1 (allowed after event5), then event3 must happen next (by after event1 → event3). So from that next state event3 does eventually happen.
- If the next state is event2 (also allowed after event5), then event4 must follow (2→4). From event4 one allowed choice is event2 again (4→2), so one possible infinite path is 2→4→2→4→... which never reaches event3. Thus from the next state = event2, event3 is not guaranteed to eventually occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because there is an allowed next state (event2) from which there exists a continuation avoiding event3 forever, C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.
Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initial state: event5 happens. From event5 the next event can be either event1 or event2.
- If the next event is event1, event1 forces event3 next, so event3 would occur.
- But if the next event is event2, then event2 forces event4, and from event4 one may choose event2 again. This yields the cycle 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... which never reaches event3.
- Because there is a possible next-state (the one where event2 occurs) from which event3 may never occur, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is False."

We want to know whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False. C1 says ""Event4 always happens.""

Examine the transition rules (duplicates removed):
- start: event1
- after 1 → {2, 5}
- after 2 → {1, 3, 5}
- after 3 → {1, 2, 4}
- after 4 → {1, 3}
- after 5 → {1, 2, 3}

From the initial event1 we can choose 2, then from 2 choose 5, then from 5 choose 1, and repeat:
1 → 2 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 5 → ... 
This infinite run never includes event4. Therefore C1 (""Event4 always happens"") is false (it is not inevitable). Consequently C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 always happens."" (i.e., in every possible future execution, event4 occurs)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" So we must decide whether C1 is true (and thus C2 true) or false.

Step 2 — Extract the transition rules
- Start: event1 happened.
- From 1 → {2, 5}
- From 2 → {1, 3, 5}
- From 3 → {1, 2, 4}
- From 4 → {1, 3}
- From 5 → {1, 2, 3}

Step 3 — Reason about inevitability of event4
- Event4 can only occur as a successor of event3 (3 → 4).
- So for event4 to be unavoidable, event3 would have to occur on every possible run starting from the initial state.
- But starting at event1 we can choose 1 → 2 and then 2 → 1, and repeat this cycle forever: 1,2,1,2,... This cycle never visits event3 (and thus never produces event4).
- Because there is a valid execution that never reaches event4, ""Event4 always happens"" (C1) is false.

Final answer
- C2 is False.
---
We start at event1. From event1 one allowed next event is event5. From event5 one allowed next event is event1. So there is a valid infinite trace:

event1 → event5 → event1 → event5 → ...

This trace never includes event4, so ""Event4 always happens"" (C1) is false. Therefore the claim that C1 always holds (C2) is also false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.”
- C2: “C1 always holds” (i.e., event2 never happens at any point).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the constraints.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event5 happened.
- “After event5, event2 must happen.” (appears twice but same requirement)
- Other rules allow successors but do not forbid event2.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event5 happened initially and after event5 event2 must happen, event2 will occur.
- Therefore C1 (“Event2 does not happen”) is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 happens (given).
- The rules state: after event5, event2 must happen.
- Therefore event2 does happen (immediately after the initial event5).
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is thus false.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., event2 never happens). Since event2 does happen, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., event2 never happens in any allowed sequence).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event5 happened.
- After event5, event2 must happen.
- (Other rules are irrelevant once we see event5 → event2.)

Step 3 — reason through sequences:
- Because event5 happened initially and after event5 event2 must happen, event2 does happen.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens and event5 happens"" (i.e., both events occur at some points).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — asking whether there is a future sequence of events in which both event4 and event5 occur.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event5 has happened.
- After event5, event1 must happen.
- After event1, one of {event2, event3, event4, event5} happens (nondeterministic choice).
- After event4, one of {event3, event5} happens.
- (Other rules: after event2 → {1,4,5}; after event3 → {1,4,5}.)

Step 3 — construct a satisfying sequence
- Start: event5 (given).
- After that, event1 must occur.
- From event1 we can choose event4.
- From event4 we can choose event5.
- Sequence: 5 (initial) → 1 → 4 → 5 — here both event4 and event5 occur, so C1 holds at that point.

Conclusion
- Because such a sequence exists, C1 can eventually hold, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is guaranteed from the given initial condition and transition rules.

- C1 = ""Event4 happens and event5 happens."" Initially event5 has happened, so only event4 is missing to make C1 true.
- From event5 the rule forces event1 next.
- From event1 the allowed next events are {event2, event3, event4, event5}.

A counterexample (an allowed infinite trace that never reaches C1) is:
5 (initial) → 1 → 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 → ...
This is allowed because after 5 we must go to 1, and after 1 we are allowed to choose 5 again. In this infinite execution event4 never occurs, so C1 never becomes true. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — restate rules (compact):
- Initially: event5.
- After event5 → event1.
- After event1 → one of {event2, event3, event4, event5}.
- After event4 → one of {event3, event5}.
- After event2 → one of {event1, event4, event5}.
- After event3 → one of {event1, event4, event5}.

Step 2 — construct a trace showing both event4 and event5 occur:
- t0: event5 (given).
- t1: must be event1 (since after event5 → event1).
- t2: choose event4 (allowed since after event1 one option is event4).

By t2 we have seen event5 (t0) and event4 (t2). Thus the condition ""Event4 happens and event5 happens"" is satisfied along this execution, so C1 becomes true at/by that point.

Conclusion: C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate next step).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some future state from which the next state has event4.

Step 2 — examine the rules / transitions
- Initially event4 occurred.
- After event4, event2 must happen (no choice).
- After event2, next is either event1 or event3.
- After event1, next is either event2 or event3.
- After event3, no further events (terminal).
- After event5, next is either event2 or event4.
Note: the only way to get event4 as the immediate next event is to be in a state where event5 just occurred (because only the ""after event5"" rule allows event4 next).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state
- Start: event4.
- Next must be event2 (by ""after event4"").
- From event2:
  - If event3 occurs, sequence ends (terminal).
  - If event1 occurs, then from event1 you get either event2 (loop back) or event3 (then terminal).
In no branch does any rule produce event5, and no rule allows event4 to occur except as the successor of event5.

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- Immediately after the initial event4, the next event is event2, so C1 is false now.
- Since no rule ever leads to event5, event4 cannot ever appear as the next event in the future either. Therefore there is no future state from which the next state has event4, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First, restate the hypotheses to be clear:
- Initially event4 happened.
- Transitions:
  - After event4, event2 must happen.
  - After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen.
  - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
  - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
  - After event3, no other events can happen.

C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state.""  
C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point there is a state whose immediate next event is event4.

Reasoning:
1. From the transition rules, the only rule that allows event4 to be the next event is the rule ""After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen."" So event4 can be the next event only when the current event is event5.
2. Starting from the initial event4, the next event must be event2 (by the rule ""After event4, event2 must happen"").
3. From event2 the system can go to event1 or event3. If it goes to event3, the run ends (no further events). If it goes to event1, from there it can go to event2 or event3, and this cycle (event2↔event1) can repeat or end at event3. None of these transitions produce event5.
4. There is no rule that allows event5 to occur after any of the reachable events (event4, event2, event1, event3). Therefore event5 is unreachable from the initial state.
5. Because event5 never occurs, the only transition that could produce event4 as the next event never becomes applicable. So there is no future state where the immediate next event is event4.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state"" (i.e. X event4).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. F X event4). We must decide whether, from the given rules and initial condition, there will necessarily be some future state whose next state is event4.

Step 2 — Examine the rules / conditions
- Initially: event4 happened.
- After event4 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → either event1 or event3.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event3 → no further events (terminal).
- After event5 → either event2 or event4.
Note: there is no rule that allows event5 to occur after any of the given events.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences from the initial event4
- Start: event4.
- Next (forced): event2.
- From event2 you must choose event1 or event3.
  - If you choose event3 → sequence ends (event4, event2, event3); no further states, so no future state has next = event4.
  - If you choose event1 → you can then choose event2 or event3. That allows looping between event1 and event2 any number of times, or eventually choosing event3 and terminating. Still no rule produces event5, and the only rule that produces event4 (besides the initial one) is ""after event5"". Since event5 never occurs, no future transition can produce event4.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- There is no way (given the rules and initial event4) to reach a state whose next state is event4, because the only way to produce event4 after the initial occurrence is via event5, which cannot occur here.
- Therefore C1 never holds at any future state, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened. The rule ""After event4, either event2 or event5 must happen"" means the immediate next state can be event2 or event5, but not both simultaneously.
- C1 asserts ""Event5 happens and event2 happens"" (both). C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., both happen in the next state).
- Since the next state after event4 can be either event2 or event5, it cannot be both at once. (You can have a sequence event4 → event5 → event2, so both events occur over time, but not both in the immediate next state.)
Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened. The rule ""After event4, either event2, or event5 must happen"" means the next state must contain exactly one of {event2, event5}, not both.
- C1 requires both event5 and event2 to happen. C2 says C1 holds in the next state, i.e. the next state contains both event5 and event2.
- That contradicts the ""either ... or"" constraint after event4, so both cannot hold simultaneously in the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event4 happened, so in the next state (call it s1) either event2 or event5 must occur — but not both at once.
- C1 requires both event5 and event2 to happen in the same state. There is no rule that allows both to occur simultaneously; the rules present a choice (either/or) after event4.
- Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: event4 happens and event1 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event4 happens. So C2 is logically equivalent to C1 (it just repeats event4). Thus the question is whether, from the initial facts and rules, both event4 and event1 must happen.

Step 2 — examine the rules and possible sequences
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen.
  - If we pick event4, then from event4 we can later (via event2 or event3 and then event2) reach event1, so a sequence that achieves both event4 and event1 exists.
  - But the rules are nondeterministic (""either ... or ... must happen""), so other choices are allowed. For example: choose event2 after event5; from event2 choose event5; and repeat: event5 → event2 → event5 → ... This infinite loop never produces event4 or event1.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Because there are valid sequences starting from the initial event5 in which event4 and event1 never occur, C2 is not guaranteed to be true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = (event4 happens AND event1 happens).
- C2 = (C1 holds AND event4 happens). (C2 is equivalent to ""event4 and event1 happen"" — the extra ""event4 happens"" is redundant.)

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event5 happens.
- After event5 → either event2 or event4.
- After event4 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event1 or event5.
- After event3 → event2.
- After event1 → either event2 or event4.

Step 3 — reason about possibility vs. necessity
- It is possible to get both event4 and event1. Example: event5 → event4 → event2 → event1. So C2 can be true on some runs.
- But C2 is not forced on every run. Counterexample run: event5 → event2 → event5 → event2 → ... (always choose the branch back to event5), so event4 and event1 never occur. Thus C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Final answer: False

First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = ""Event4 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds and event4 happens."" (This is equivalent to C1, since C1 already asserts event4 happens.)

Conditions (from the context):
- Initially event5 happened.
- After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen.
- After event4, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event5 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen.

Can both event4 and event1 occur starting from the initial event5?
- Path A: 5 -> 4 (allowed by ""after 5: 2 or 4"") -> 2 (after 4: 2 or 3) -> 1 (after 2: 1 or 5). This sequence contains both event4 and event1, so C1 holds.
- Path B (alternative): 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 is also valid (5->2; 2->1; 1->4), again producing both events.

Since there exists a valid sequence satisfying that both event4 and event1 happen, C1 is true, and therefore C2 (equivalent to C1) is also true.

Final answer:
True"

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the claims:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — i.e. at time s1 (one step after the initial s0) we have event1.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. at s1 it is true that C1 holds, so at s2 (two steps from s0) event1 holds. So C2 asserts ""event1 occurs at s2.""

2. Relevant transition rules (from initial s0 with event3):
   - s0 = event3, so s1 ∈ {event2, event4, event5}.
   - From event2: next ∈ {event4, event5}.
   - From event4: next = event1.
   - From event5: next ∈ {event3, event4}.
   - From event1: next = event2.

3. Provide a counterexample path showing C2 can fail:
   - Choose s1 = event2 (allowed because after event3, event2 is allowed).
   - From event2 choose s2 = event4 (allowed).
   - Then s2 = event4, so event1 does NOT occur at s2. Therefore C2 (which requires event1 at s2) is false on this path.

Because there is a permitted sequence where C2 does not hold, C2 is not guaranteed — so the correct answer is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, restate C2: C2 says ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""it is not the case that Event1 does not happen"" — equivalently, Event1 does happen.

From the context:
- Initially 3 happens.
- After 3, 4 must happen. So we get 3 → 4.
- After 4, one of {2, 3, 5} must happen. If we choose 3, then after 3 we must go to 4 again.
Thus there is a valid infinite sequence 3 → 4 → 3 → 4 → ... that never includes Event1.

Because Event1 can be indefinitely avoided, Event1 is not forced to occur. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") can hold, so C2 (""Event1 does happen"") is not true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning summary:
- Start: event3 occurs, and after event3 event4 must follow. So we have event3 → event4.
- After event4 we may choose event3 (or event2 or event5). If we choose event3, we return to event4 (event3 → event4), producing an indefinite cycle event3 ↔ event4.
- That cycle never requires event1, so it is possible for event1 to never happen (C1 can hold).
- Because event1 need not occur, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event1 does occur) is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is not true.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 = ""Event1 does not happen.""  
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ""Event1 does happen."" So C2 asserts that Event1 must occur.
- From the premises: initially Event3 happens, and 3 -> 4 (after 3, 4 must happen). From 4, at least one of {2,3,5} must happen.
- We can choose 3 after 4, giving the loop 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... indefinitely. This satisfies all rules and never forces Event1 to occur.
- Because there is a valid sequence in which Event1 never happens, C1 can hold; therefore C2 (that Event1 does happen) is not entailed.

So C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the system
- Initially event4.
- From event4 you can go to event1 or event5.
- From event5 you can go to event1, event2, event3, or event4.
- From event3 you can go to event1 or event2.
- From event1 you must go to event4.
- So event2 is reachable (e.g. e4 → e5 → e2), but not guaranteed on every run (e.g. e4 → e1 → e4 → … could avoid e2 forever).

Step 3 — analyze C2
- C1 is the statement ""event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 says: if C1 holds, then event2 happens.
- This is tautological: assuming ""event2 eventually happens"" is true (the antecedent), the conclusion ""event2 happens"" follows by the meaning of C1. In other words, C2 just restates that if event2 does eventually occur, then event2 does occur.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- C1 states ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 states ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""
- By definition, C1 already asserts that event2 happens (at some point). So C2 is effectively ""If (event2 eventually happens) then (event2 eventually happens)"" — a tautology.
- Therefore the implication in C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 is the statement ""Event2 eventually happens"" (there exists some future step where event2 occurs).
- C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" That is just the implication C1 → (event2 happens). But C1 itself is exactly ""event2 happens (at some future time)"". So the implication is a tautology: if ""event2 eventually happens"" is true, then ""event2 happens"" is true by definition.
- (As a sanity check on the event graph: from the initial event4 you can reach event2 along 4 → 5 → 2, so C1 is satisfiable, though not guaranteed on every nondeterministic path.)

Therefore C2 is True."
