After event3, either event2 or event5 must happen, leading to a cycle involving event2 and event3, with event5 already occurred.

C1 states: ""If event2 happens, then event5 happens."" Since event5 happened initially, and event2 occurs after event5, event5 has always happened before any occurrence of event2. Therefore, whenever event2 happens, event5 has already occurred, so C1 is always true.

C2 states: ""Event4 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is always true regardless of whether event4 happens.

By analyzing the possible sequences, it is possible to construct a sequence where event3 never occurs. For example:
- Start with event5.
- From event5, go to event2 (since after event5, either event1 or event2 must happen).
- From event2, go to event4 (since after event2, either event3, event4, or event5 must happen; choosing event4 avoids event3).
- From event4, go to event1 (since after event4, either event1, event2, or event5 must happen).
- From event1, go to event4 (since after event1, either event3 or event4 must happen; choosing event4 avoids event3).
- Repeat the loop between event1 and event4 indefinitely.

In this sequence, event3 never occurs. Therefore, C1 is false, meaning that event3 does not always happen. Thus, C2 is true.

The hypothesis C1 states that ""Event1 always happens,"" meaning that in every possible sequence starting from event4, event1 must occur at least once. However, it is possible to have sequences where event1 never occurs, such as event4 followed by event3, then event4, event3, and so on indefinitely. Therefore, C1 is false.

C2 states that ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true. Even if event1 happens in some sequences, C1 does not hold, so C2 is false.

Initially, event4 happened. After event2, event3 must happen. After event3, either event1, event4, or event5 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. After event4, either event1, event2, or event3 must happen. After event5, event1 must happen.
