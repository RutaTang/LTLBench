Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""event2 or event1"".
2. C2 asserts the implication ""if C1 holds then event2 holds"" — i.e., whenever a state has event1 or event2, that state must have event2 (so in particular event1 implies event2).
3. Initially event2 holds. From event2, one allowed next state is event1 (after event2, either event1, event3, or event4 must happen).
4. In the reachable state where event1 holds, only event1 is true (events are mutually exclusive), so C1 holds (because event1 is true) but event2 is false.

- Under the usual interpretation each state has one event true. C1 (event3 AND event5 in the same state) is impossible, so C1 never holds; therefore ""if C1 then event2"" is vacuously true.
- Even if the user meant ""event3 happens at some time and event5 happens at some (possibly different) time"", the dynamics still force event2: from event3 the chain is event3 -> event4 -> event2, and from event5 the next state is either event2 or event3 (which then leads to event2).

1. C1 states: ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e., in every state along every possible execution, event5 holds).

4. From event1 we can go to event2. From event2 we can go back to event1 (2 -> 1 is allowed). Thus there is an infinite path 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... that never visits event5.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Interpret events as exclusive per state and transitions as given:
   - Initial state: event2.
   - From event2: no other events can happen → event2 is absorbing (stays event2).
   - From event5: next must be event1 or event2.
   - From event1: next must be event3 or event5.
   - From event3: next must be event4 or event5.
   - From event4: next must be event3 or event5.
2. Because event2 is absorbing and the system starts in event2, no other event (including event5) is ever reached.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" That is true exactly in a state whose successor is event4 — i.e., in a state that is event5 and then transitions to event4 (because only after event5 can event4 occur).
2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as: whenever the current state satisfies C1 (its next state is event4), the current state must have event1 true.
3. From the context: Initially event2. After event2 one possible next state is event5. From event5 one allowed next state is event4.
4. In the state event5 (with next state event4), C1 holds, but event1 does not hold (the state is event5, not event1).
5. Thus there is a reachable state where C1 is true and event1 is false, so the implication C2 is false."

2. C2 is: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e., event1 ∨ (event1 → event4).)

1. We start in the initial state: event1 happened.
2. After event1, the next state must be one of: event3, event4, or event5.
3. Consider each possibility:
   - If the next state is event3, then C1 (event2 or event3) holds immediately (event3 true).
   - If the next state is event5, then by the rule ""after event5, event3 must happen"" the following state is event3, so C1 holds (event3).
   - If the next state is event4, then by the rule ""after event4, either event2 or event3 must happen"" there are two subcases:
     - If event3 happens after event4, C1 holds (event3).
     - If event2 happens after event4, C1 holds (event2).

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 requires ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., every state is event2). That is already impossible because the initial state is event3 (so C1 is false immediately).
- Even ignoring the initial state, C1 is impossible by the transition rules: after event2 the next state must be event3 or event5, so you cannot have event2 in every state.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true, so ""If C1 holds, then event4 happens"" is vacuously true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 asserts ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e., every state must be event2. That is already false in the initial state, because initially event3 happened, not event2.
2. C2 says ""If event4 happens, then C1 holds."" For C2 to be true in all behaviors, either event4 can never occur or when it does occur C1 must hold.
3. From the initial state (event3) a transition 3 -> 4 is allowed (after event3, event4 may happen). So event4 can occur.
4. After event4, the system may go to event1 (4 -> 1), and many states in the run (including the initial one) are not event2, so C1 does not hold.
5. Therefore there is a possible behavior where event4 happens but C1 is false, so the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Hence C2 is False."

3. From the context:

   - After event4, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event4 thereafter).
   - The rules about event2, event3, event5 do not provide any transitions from the reachable states (event1 or event4), so they are irrelevant here.

3. Observe: none of the transitions permit moving to event5. Event5 has a rule for what follows it, but there is no rule that can produce event5 from any reachable event.
4. Starting at event3 and following the allowed transitions, event5 is unreachable, so ""Event5 does not happen"" holds in the initial state and in every reachable state.
5. Therefore C1 (Event5 does not happen) always holds, so C2 is True.

- C1 is the state formula ""if event1 happens then event4 happens"" (i.e. event1 → event4).
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state, event1 → event4 must be true).

Step 2 — what is the next state?
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules say: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. So the next state is either event2 or event3 (and thus event1 is false in the next state).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in that next state
- In the next state event1 is false, so the implication (event1 → event4) is true regardless of whether event4 holds.

Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

2. C1 is ""Event2 always happens."" On this single-state trace event2 holds at every state (the only state), so C1 is true.

3. C2 is ""C1 always holds."" Evaluated over the same trace, C1 holds at the only state, so C2 is true. (Equivalently, in temporal logic G(G event2) = G event2, so if C1 is true then C2 is also true.)

Reasoning:
- C1 (""Event5 always happens"") is false in the model because the initial state is event2 (so event5 does not hold at the initial state).
- C2 says: if event4 happens, then C1 holds. For C2 to be true, every trace where event4 occurs must satisfy C1.
- But event4 is reachable (example trace: event2 → event1 → event4), and C1 is already false in this model.
- Therefore there exists a trace where event4 happens while C1 is false, so the implication in C2 fails.

1. Interpret C1 as: whenever event2 happens (at some state), event1 will happen (at some point afterward). We can also see that even if interpreted as ""in the same state event2 implies event1"", it will fail, because initial state has event2 true and event1 false. Either interpretation leads to the same conclusion here.

2. From the context build the transition graph:
   - 2 -> 5
   - 5 -> 3 or 4
   - 3 -> 1 or 2 or 4
   - 4 -> 1 or 5
   - 1 -> terminal (no further events)

3. Starting from the initial state (event2), one possible path is:
   2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> ... 
   (choose 5->3 and 3->2 repeatedly). This infinite path never reaches event1.

4. Because there exists a valid execution where event2 occurs but event1 never occurs, C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") does not hold.

5. C2 states ""C1 does not hold."" Therefore C2 is True.

5. To evaluate C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): look at the next state (which is event4). There, C1 requires that event4 happens in that state's next state. Because event4 self-loops, its next state is event4, so C1 is true at that next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 means ""event3 always holds"" (every state has event3).
2. The initial state is event5, so C1 is already false (initial state is not event3).
3. For C2 (""if event4 happens, then C1 holds"") to be true, whenever event4 occurs the global property C1 must hold.
4. Event4 can occur (from the initial event5 the next state may be event4), so the antecedent can be satisfied.
5. But C1 is false (see step 2), so the implication fails.
6. Even under a weaker reading (""if event4 happens, then from that point event3 always holds"") the implication still fails: from event4 one may transition to event1 and then avoid event3 indefinitely (e.g. cycle event1↔event4), so event3 is not guaranteed.

1. If event1 is true at a state, then ""event1 eventually happens"" is immediately true at that same state (the eventuality is satisfied at the current moment).
2. Thus at any state where the antecedent (event1) holds, the consequent (C1) also holds. So the implication event1 -> C1 is true in every state where event1 is true.

- C2 = C1 does not hold (i.e., ¬C1).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (initial state: event1 true).
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” That prevents any transition to states where event3 or event5 occur.
- The other ""after"" rules (for event2, event3, event4, event5) cannot fire because no event occurs after the initial event1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 at the initial/only reachable state:
- Event5 is false and Event3 is false (only event1 holds and no other events can happen).

1. C2 means: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
2. C1 is the state formula (event4 → event5) — true in any state where event4 is false, and only false in a state where event4 is true but event5 is false.
3. Initially event3 holds. From event3 the next state must be either event1 or event2 (given ""After event3, either event1, or event2 must happen"").
4. Evaluate C1 in each possible next state:
   - If the next state is event1, event4 is false, so (event4 → event5) is true.
   - If the next state is event2, event4 is false, so (event4 → event5) is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event2.
2. From event2, event4 must happen next.
3. From event4, no other events can happen (it stays at event4 forever).
4. Thus the only possible trace is 2 -> 4 -> 4 -> ... and event3 never occurs on this trace.
5. C1 is the state formula (event3 implies event2). At any visited state event3 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; in particular C1 holds at the initial state.

1. C1 is the state formula: (event1 → event2) — ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" in that state.
2. C2 says: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., at the immediate successor of the initial state).
3. Initially event3 happened. The context says: after event3, either event2 or event4 must happen. So the immediate next state is either event2 or event4.
4. Check C1 in each possible next state:
   - If the next state is event2: event1 is false and event2 is true, so (event1 → event2) is true.
   - If the next state is event4: event1 is false (and event2 false), so (event1 → event2) is true (implication true when antecedent false).
5. Since C1 holds in all possible next states, C2 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context, initially event4 happened.
2. The rules say ""after event4, no other events can happen"" (repeated). That makes event4 an absorbing state: once at event4, the system stays at event4 forever.
3. Therefore every reachable state (the initial state and all future states) has event4 true and event2 false.
4. C1 is the state formula ""if event2 happens then event3 happens"" (equivalently, not event2 or event3). In any state where event2 is false, C1 is true.
5. Since C1 holds at the initial state (event2 is false there), C1 already holds now.

Reasoning:
1. C1 is the statement ""If event5 happens, then event1 happens"" (interpreted as a plain state implication: event5 -> event1).
2. Initially event5 is true. In these models only one event holds in a state, so event1 is false in the initial state.
3. Thus the implication event5 -> event1 is false in the initial state, so C1 does not hold.
4. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"", so C2 is true.

(If one instead reads C1 as a temporal claim ""whenever event5 occurs then event1 must occur next/afterwards"", that is also false because after event5 the system may go to event3 (rule: after event5 either event1 or event3), so C1 still fails.)"

3. Therefore C1 is already false in the initial state.

1. C1 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then event4 happens"" (formally: event1 -> event4).
2. C2 is: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (formally: event1 -> C1), which equates logically to event1 -> (event1 -> event4). This simplifies to event1 -> event4, so C2 is equivalent to C1.
3. The context says: ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means in the initial state event1 is true and event4 is not true (only one event per state and no following events).
4. Therefore there is a state (the initial state) where event1 is true but event4 is false, so C1 is false.
5. Since C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 is also false.

- C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreting this as a state formula about the initial state, C1 holds at the initial state.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 does hold initially, C2 is false.

(If instead C1 were intended as the global property ""event2 never happens"", there still exists a valid execution avoiding event2 forever: start event3 -> event5 -> event1 -> event5 -> event1 -> ... , so event2 is not forced to occur.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says “event1 does not happen” (no occurrence of event1 in the run).
2. C2 is “C1 holds and event2 happens” — i.e., event1 never occurs and event2 occurs at some point.
3. The system starts with event4 (initially event4 happened).
4. After event4, event2 must happen — so event2 occurs immediately after the initial state.
5. From event2 the system may go to event1, event3, or event5. To satisfy C1 we must avoid choosing event1.
6. We can choose event3 after event2. After event3, event2 must happen, and we can again choose event3, and so on.
7. The infinite trace 4 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... contains event2 and never contains event1, so C1 holds and event2 happens.
8. Therefore C2 is satisfiable (true)."

4. For C2 to be true at the initial state, C1 must hold in each possible next state (i.e., from that next state onward, every state must be event1).
5. But from any state where event1 holds, the next state cannot be event1 (1 -> 2 or 5). Thus it is impossible for ""event1 always happens"" to hold at any state (there are always successors that are not event1).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is the state formula: ""if event2 happens, then event5 happens"" — interpreted as in any single state, event2 ⇒ event5.
2. In these models only one event holds in a state; so the implication fails in any state where event2 holds (because event5 is not also true there).
3. From the initial state event4, a transition allows event2 next (after event4, either event2 or event5 must happen), so a state with event2 is reachable.
4. In that reachable event2 state C1 is false, so C1 does not hold in all states.
5. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False."

Reasoning:
1. C1 is ""If event4 happens, then event4 happens"" (P -> P), which is a tautology and therefore holds in every state.
2. C2 is ""C1 holds and event5 happens"", so C2 is true in a state exactly when event5 happens in that state (since C1 is always true).
3. The initial state has event3 true (the context says ""Initially, event3 happened""), not event5.
4. Although event5 can occur in a future state (after event3 one possible next event is event5), C2 as written makes no temporal claim — it requires event5 in the current state.

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., the immediate successor of the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — Use the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event4 must happen next.

Step 3 — Reasoning about the next state:
- From the initial state (event1), the next state could be event2 or event4 (the context allows either).
- Therefore C1 (event2 in the next state) is possible but not guaranteed.
- Because there is a possible run where event2 does happen next, C1 is not ruled out.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 definitely does not happen next). That is not entailed by the context because event2 might happen next.
- Thus C2 is False.

2. From event3 the allowed next events include event1, event2, or event4 (these choices avoid event5).
3. From event1 the allowed next events include event2 or event3 (again avoid event5).
4. From event2 the allowed next events include event3 or event4 (avoid event5).

2. In the given model, states are labeled by which single event just happened (as in the examples). Only one event holds at a time.

Reasoning:
- Initially event5 occurs, and after event5 event3 must happen. So the sequence starts event5 -> event3.
- After event3, the next event can be either event1 or event2.
- If we always choose event2 after event3, then after event2 we can choose event5 (allowed), which forces event3 next, and the cycle repeats: event5 -> event3 -> event2 -> event5 -> ...
- That infinite cycle never includes event1, so there is a valid execution in which ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1 holds).
- Since there exists a valid execution where C1 holds, C1 is not falsified, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""event1 does happen"") is not guaranteed true.

Step 2 — can Event1 and Event2 be true simultaneously?

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 asserts ""Event5 always happens"" (i.e. event5 holds in the initial state and in every reachable state).
2. The initial state is event1, so event5 does not hold initially. Therefore C1 is already false.
3. Even if one could reach event5 later, the transition rules allow moving from event5 to event1 or event2, and from event1 to non-5 events; so there are reachable states where event5 does not hold, further contradicting C1.
4. C2 is C1 AND (event5 happens). Since C1 is false, C2 is false regardless of whether event5 happens somewhere.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Start state: event1 occurs.
2. From event1 the allowed next events are {event2, event4, event5}.
3. Choose the transition event1 -> event2 (allowed).
4. From event2 the allowed next events include event3, and from event3 the allowed next events include event2 (e2 -> e3 and e3 -> e2 are both allowed).
5. Thus there is a reachable infinite run: event1, event2, event3, event2, event3, ... that never returns to event1 after the initial state.
6. C1 means “event1 holds in the next state.” On that run, no state has its next state equal to event1, so C1 never holds there.
7. Therefore C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is not guaranteed by the context; it can be false on a valid run.

1. C1 = ""Event5 happens in the next state.""  
   C2 = ""Event5 happens now AND C1 holds"" = ""Event5 happens now AND Event5 happens in the next state"" (two consecutive states with event5).

2. Initial state: event3 holds.

3. Look at the transition rules for what can happen next:
   - After event3, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, one of event1, event3, or event4 must happen.
   - After event1, one of event2 or event3 must happen.
   - After event4, event3 must happen.
   - After event5, event3 must happen.

   None of these rules ever produces event5 as a successor. There is no ""after X, event5 happens"" rule.

4. Therefore event5 can never occur in any reachable state (starting from the initial event3).

5. Since event5 cannot occur, C2 (""event5 now and event5 next"") cannot be true.

1. C1 requires event3 and event4 to hold in the same state (conjunction is a single-state requirement).
2. From the transition rules: start at event3, and possible successors are event2 or event5; from event2 the successors are event1, event3, or event5; from event1 the successor is event2; event5 is terminal. No rule ever leads to event4.
3. Therefore event4 can never occur in any state reachable from the initial state, so C1 can never be true.

- C1 = ""event4 and event5"" — that means both event4 and event5 are true in the same state.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some reachable state where both event4 and event5 are true simultaneously.

Step 2 — system behavior and exclusivity:
- The context describes a deterministic one-event-per-state style transition system (each state is labeled by which single event happened). This is consistent with the examples: only one event holds in any given state.
- Transitions: 5 -> 1, 1 -> {2,3,4,5}, 2 -> {1,4,5}, 3 -> {1,4,5}, 4 -> {3,5}.

Step 3 — can C1 ever be true?
- Because exactly one event holds in a state, no state can have both event4 and event5 true simultaneously.
- Although event4 and event5 can occur at different times (e.g., 5 (initial) -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 ...), they never hold in the same state.

- Since C1 is impossible in any state, C1 never holds; therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

1. C1: ""Event4 happens in the next state."" C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" — i.e., there exists some state whose successor state is event4.

2. From the context: Initially event4 happens (state0). After event4, event2 must happen, so state1 = event2.

3. From event2, the next state must be either event1 or event3.
   - If event2 → event1, then from event1 the next state is either event2 or event3.
   - If event2 → event3, event3 is terminal (no further events).

4. The only rule that can produce event4 after some state is ""After event5, either event2 or event4 must happen."" But nothing in the context ever leads to event5, and event5 does not occur initially. So no reachable transition can produce event4 again after the initial state.

5. At the initial state (state0) C1 is false because the next state (state1) is event2, not event4. At no later state can the next state be event4 (no rule produces event4 in reachable runs).

2. C1 is ""Event5 happens and Event2 happens"" — i.e., both event5 and event2 must be true in the same state.
3. The event model here (as in the examples) has exactly one event happening per state, so two different events cannot be true simultaneously in a single state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""event4 and event1"" (both hold in the same state). C2 is ""C1 and event4"", which is equivalent to ""event4 and event1"" (redundant event4).
2. The model describes discrete states where a single event occurs at a time (states represent which event happened). Events do not occur simultaneously in one state.
3. Even though event1 can occur later in a run (e.g. event5 -> event4 -> event2 -> event1), there is no state in which event4 and event1 are both true simultaneously.

1. C1 is ""Event1 always happens"" — i.e., in every state from a given point onward, event1 holds.
2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., starting at the state immediately after the initial state, event1 must hold in every future state.
3. From the context the initial event is event2. After event2, the next state must be either event1 or event3.
4. Consider the possible next state = event1. From event1 the rules allow the next state to be event2 (after event1, either event2, event3, or event4 must happen). That means starting from that next state (event1), it is possible to move to a state where event1 does not hold. Thus C1 (event1 always) does not hold in that next state.
5. Because there exists a permitted continuation from the next state (when it's event1) that violates ""event1 always"", C2 is not guaranteed true.
6. Therefore C2 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event3 is true.
2. The next state (after event3) must be event4. C2 requires that C1 (event1 eventually happens) holds at that next state.
3. From event4 the forced sequence is: event4 -> event5 -> event2.
4. After event2 there is a choice: either event1 occurs, or event5 occurs.
5. If the choice repeatedly selects event5, the system cycles event2 -> event5 -> event2 -> ... indefinitely and event1 never occurs.
6. Therefore, starting from the next state (event4) it is not guaranteed that event1 will eventually happen (there exists a valid future that never reaches event1).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = (event1) OR (event3).
2. C2 asserts that C1 always holds (in every state).
3. Initially event1 holds, so C1 is true in the initial state.
4. From event1 the context allows a transition to event2 (after event1, either event2, event3, or event5 must happen).
5. In a state where event2 holds, neither event1 nor event3 holds, so C1 is false in that state.
6. Therefore there is a reachable state where C1 is false, so C1 does not hold always.

Reasoning:
1. From the context and the examples, events are mutually exclusive in a single state (only one event holds at a time).
2. C1 is ""Event4 happens and event5 happens"" — this requires both event4 and event5 to be true in the same state.
3. Because only one event can be true in any state, C1 can never be true in any single state.

2. C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 holds in the initial state, C2 requires that event2 holds (at some relevant point).
3. From the context, after event5 either event2 or event4 must happen. There are two possible next-state branches:
   - Branch A: 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> ... (event2 does occur).
   - Branch B: 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4 -> ... (event2 never occurs).

4. From event2, a next state can be event3 (allowed by ""After event2, either event3, or event5 must happen"").
5. Thus a reachable state exists where event3 is true.
6. In that state only event3 is true (events are mutually exclusive per state), so event5 is false there.

1. Initially event5 happened, so C1 (""Event5 eventually happens"") is true at the initial state (it already happened).
2. C2 says: C1 holds in the next state. So evaluate C1 at the state immediately after the initial state.
3. After event5, the next state must be event4 (rule: after event5, event4 must happen).
4. From event4, the rules force either event1 or event3 next. If event4 -> event1, then event1 -> event3, and event3 is terminal (no further events). If event4 -> event3 directly, event3 is terminal. In neither case can event5 occur again.
5. There is no rule that leads back to event5 from any reachable state after the initial one, so starting at the next state (event4) event5 never occurs.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 = (event5 AND event4). C2 = (event3 AND C1).
2. As in the examples, an event predicate like ""eventX happens"" denotes that eventX holds in a particular state. Conjunction thus requires both events to hold in the same state.
3. There is no rule that allows event4 to occur after any of the listed events (the only rule mentioning event4 is ""After event4, event1 must happen"" — it constrains what follows event4, not what leads to it). The allowed successors from reachable events (event1 → event3 → {event1,event5} → {event1,event2,event3} ...) never include event4.
4. Even if event4 were reachable at some point, C1 requires event5 and event4 to hold simultaneously in one state, which is impossible (only one event holds per state).

- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires some state where event3 is true and C1 (the implication) is true as a global/state property.

Step 2 — note exclusivity of events:
As in the examples, only one event can hold in a single state. So event2 and event3 cannot both be true in the same state.

Step 3 — check reachability of event3:
Initially event5 holds. From event5 the rules allow the next state to be event1, event2, or event3. So event3 can and does occur in a reachable state.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 where event3 occurs:
In any state where event3 occurs, event2 is not true simultaneously (events are mutually exclusive). Thus the implication ""if event3 then event2"" is false in that state. Hence C1 does not hold.

C2 requires both that event3 happens and that C1 holds. We can have event3 happen, but C1 is false. Therefore C2 is false.

4. So to make C2 true we would need C1 to hold (event2 always true).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event3 is true.
2. From event3, the rules force event1 next (""After event3, event1 must happen"").
3. From event1, the rules force event3 next (""After event1, event3 must happen"").
4. Thus the system is stuck in the deterministic 3↔1 cycle (3,1,3,1,...) and never leaves to reach events 2, 4, or 5.
5. Therefore C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true (event1 occurs immediately after the initial state and repeatedly).

Reasoning:
- C1 means “event4 holds in the next state.” C2 = (C1) AND (event2 holds now). So C2 requires a state where event2 is true and the following state is event4.
- From the rules starting at initial event4, the only successors are 1 or 3 (from 4); from 1 → {3,4,5}; from 3 → {4,5}; from 5 → 3. No rule ever produces event2 as a successor.
- Therefore event2 is unreachable and never happens; C2 cannot be satisfied. (Also, even if event2 occurred, its successors are 1 or 5, not 4, so C1 would fail.)"

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event4 holds now). C1 is ""event4 holds in the next state.""
2. The initial state (and any state labeled event4) has event4 true now.
3. The context repeatedly specifies: after event4, either event1 or event2 must happen. There is no allowed transition from event4 to event4.
4. Therefore in any state where event4 holds now, the next state cannot be event4, so C1 is false in that state.

3. The context gives initial state = event3. From event3 the allowed next events are {event2, event4, event5}.

4. Because event2 is an allowed successor of event3, the next state need not be event5 — it could be event2. Thus C1 does not necessarily hold at the initial state.

2. We ask whether C1 (""Event5 eventually happens"") must hold on all runs from the initial state. If there exists a run that never reaches event5, then C1 does not hold (so C2 holds).

3. From the transitions, there is a cycle avoiding event5: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1. Each step is allowed (1→2, 2→3, 3→1), and none of these states is event5.

Reasoning:
- C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"". C2 = ""always C1"" (i.e., from every state, event1 will occur at some future time).
- Initially event1 holds. From event1 the rules allow either event4 or event5 next.
- From event4 you may choose event5, and from event5 you may choose event4. So there is a valid infinite trace 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, ... that never returns to event1.
- At the state labeled event4 on that trace, event1 does not occur at any future time, so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is violated.

1. C2 is the state formula: ""Event4 happens AND (Event1 OR Event3 happens)"". That requires Event4 to be true in the same state as either Event1 or Event3.
2. As in the provided examples and the model of these problems, only one event can be true in any single state. Thus two different events cannot hold simultaneously in one state.
3. Therefore it is impossible for Event4 and Event1 (or Event4 and Event3) to be true together in the same state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The initial state is event2.
2. C1 is the state-level formula ""if event1 happens then event4 happens"" (i.e., event1 -> event4). In the initial state event1 is false, so C1 is vacuously true at the initial state.
3. C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" evaluated at the initial state. Although C1 holds initially, event3 does not (initially event2 holds).
4. Therefore the conjunction C2 is false in the initial state.

2. C2 requires event1 to be true at the same state as C1 (C2 = event1 AND C1).

4. Check reachable states: from event2 you can go to event3 or event4. Event1 can occur only after event4 (event4 → event1).

1. C2 is ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event5 does not happen"". So C2 requires a state where event2 is true and event5 is false simultaneously.
2. As in the examples, exactly one event holds in any state. So if event2 holds in a state, event5 does not hold in that same state; thus C2 reduces to whether event2 ever happens.
3. Check reachability from the initial state: initially event5 happened.
4. From event5 the next events must be either event1 or event4.
   - From event1 the next events are event4 or event5.
   - From event4 the next events are event1, event3, or event5.

Reasoning (concise):
- C1 claims ""Event4 always happens"" (i.e., every future state is event4). But the rules force e4 -> e5, so e4 cannot hold in two consecutive states; therefore it is impossible for every state to be event4.
- From the initial state event2, the next state can be event1 (allowed). From event1 we must go to event5, and from event5 we can go back to event1. This produces a valid execution (e1→e5→e1→...) with no event4 at all.

Thus C2 is False."

Reasoning, step by step:
1. Initially event4 happened.
2. The rule ""After event4, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to be event1.
3. C1 is ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — interpreted as both holding in the same state.
4. In these models only one event holds in a state, so the state with event1 cannot also have event2 true.
5. Therefore C1 is false in the next state (the event1 state).
6. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is False."

1. C1 is ""event3 and event4"" — this requires both event3 and event4 to be true in the same single state.  
2. From the context (and as in the examples), each state has exactly one event happening, so two different events cannot hold simultaneously in one state. Therefore C1 is impossible in any single state.  
3. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" — that would require the immediate next state to have both event3 and event4 true at once, which is impossible for the same reason.  
4. (For completeness) Starting from the initial event2, the next state must be event4 or event5; in either case the next state contains only one event, never both event3 and event4 simultaneously.

Conclusion: C2 is False."
