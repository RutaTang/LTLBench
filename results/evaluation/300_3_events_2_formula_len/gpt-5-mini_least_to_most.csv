Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., at the initial moment event1 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- After event3, event1 must happen (event3 ⇒ eventually event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event2 happens” — a logical disjunction: C1 is true if at least one of event1 or event2 happens.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens” — i.e. (event1 ∨ event2) ∧ event1. Logically this simplifies to just event1 (because (A ∨ B) ∧ A ≡ A).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Since the initial condition states event1 happened, C1 is true (because event1 is true) and event1 is true, so C2 is true.
- Equivalently, because C2 simplifies to “event1 happens” and event1 did happen initially, C2 is true (at that initial point).

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened in the initial state (call it s0).

2) Transition rules
- After event3 occurs, the next state must have event1.
- After event1 occurs, the next state must have event2.
- After event2 occurs, the next state must have event1.
These force the following deterministic pattern once started.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (In temporal logic notation: C1 = X(event2).)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" i.e. there exists some future state where C1 is true. (Notation: C2 = F(C1) = F(X(event2)).)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Build the state sequence from s0:
  - s0: event3 (given)
  - s1: event1 (by rule after event3)
  - s2: event2 (by rule after event1)
  - s3: event1 (by rule after event2)
  - s4: event2, etc.
- Check C1 at states:
  - At s0, C1 is false because the next state s1 has event1, not event2.
  - At s1, C1 is true because the next state s2 has event2.
- Since there exists a reachable future state (s1) where C1 is true, C2 (""eventually C1"") is true. In fact, because of the alternating rules, C1 will hold at every state that contains event1, so C1 occurs infinitely often.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (a choice).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 forces event3 next).
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).
(The repeated sentence ""After event3, no other events can happen"" is just redundant.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" This is a property of the run starting now: there exists a future point at which event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This means that at some future point we will be in a state where C1 is true (i.e., from that point event3 will eventually happen). In temporal-logic terms this is F(C1). Note that C1 itself is F(event3), so C2 is F(F(event3)).

4) How they relate and final verdict
- From the transition rules the only possible sequences are:
  - event1 → event3 (stop), or
  - event1 → event2 → event3 (stop).
  In every possible future, event3 occurs. Therefore C1 (event3 eventually happens) is true right now.
- If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true (it already holds immediately). Also in linear temporal logic F(F(p)) is equivalent to F(p), so C2 is equivalent to C1 here.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen (3 → 2).
- After event2, event3 must happen (2 → 3). So 2 and 3 would form a required alternating loop if either occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant form; it is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. “event1 happens at some time in the future (possibly now).”

(There is no C3 given.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 is true now.
- An eventuality (""eventually C1"") is satisfied if C1 holds now, so C2 is true.
- The transition rules about event2 and event3 are irrelevant here because event1 is terminal and already occurred, preventing any further events.

Short answer: C2 is True under the natural reading (see assumptions below). Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially (in the current/initial state) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (i.e. from a state where event3 just happened, the next event is either event1 or event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — a claim about the immediate next state after the current one.
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens” — a disjunction: (event2 in the next state) OR (event2 happens). This second phrase is ambiguous; the most natural reading is that the second disjunct refers to the current/already-happened event2 (because the problem states “Initially, event2 happened”).

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C2 true or false?
- From the initial condition we already have event2 happened in the current/initial state.
- Because “after event2 no other events can happen,” there will be no events in the next state; therefore C1 (event2 in the next state) is false.
- But the second disjunct of C2 (“event2 happens” understood as the initial event2) is true.
- A disjunction with one true disjunct is true, so C2 is true.

Note on ambiguity: If you instead read both disjuncts of C2 as claims about the next state (i.e. C2 = “event2 in the next state OR event2 in the next state”), then C2 reduces to C1 and would be false (because no events can follow the initial event2). Under the natural interpretation that the second disjunct refers to the already-observed initial event2, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 (""event2 in the next state"") is false because after the initial event2 no events can follow, but the second disjunct (""event2 happens"") is satisfied by the initial event2, so the disjunction C2 is true."

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (There is some future time at which event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (Both: event3 eventually occurs, and event2 happens at some time.)

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- From the initial condition event2 and the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"", event3 will indeed eventually occur. So C1 is true.
- event2 already happened initially, so the second conjunct of C2 (""event2 happens"") is true as well.
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens) is true.

(If you intended ""event2 happens"" in C2 to mean ""event2 happens after event3,"" that also holds: event2 initially happened, and because event2 → event3 and event3 → event2, you get an alternating sequence event2 (initial) → event3 → event2 → …, so event2 occurs again after event3.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so at the start there is an occurrence of event2).

2) Transition rules between events (as given):
- After event3, event2 must happen (whenever event3 occurs, event2 will occur afterward).
- After event2, event3 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event3 will occur afterward).
- After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 is never stated to have happened).

3) What the sub-conditions mean:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (This is ambiguous in natural language: it could mean (A) event3 holds at every moment (globally), or (B) event3 inevitably occurs whenever required / occurs infinitely often after the start. See note below.)
- C2: ""C1 holds OR event2 happens."" That is, C2 is true if either C1 is true, or event2 occurs (at least once).

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation:
- From the initial condition, event2 did happen. That alone makes the disjunct ""event2 happens"" true.
- Therefore C2 = (C1 OR event2 happens) is true regardless of whether C1 is true or false.
- (Additional note on C1: under the rules, starting from event2 there will be event3 and then event2 and so on, so event3 will occur (repeatedly) after the start. If by ""always"" C1 was meant ""occurs at every time instant"" then C1 would be false (initial instant had event2). If ""always"" meant ""will always occur eventually / infinitely often"" then C1 could be considered true. Either way, C2 remains true because event2 did happen.)

True

Reason: the initial condition states event2 happened, so the disjunction (C1 OR event2 happens) is true regardless of C1."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So any trace that contains event1 is followed by event2.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So event2 is terminal: once event2 occurs the trace ends (no further events).
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Event3 would also be terminal, but the context gives no rule that produces event3, so it plays no role in the actual trace starting from the initial condition.

Putting the rules together, the only possible trace starting from the given initial condition is:
event1 → event2 → (end).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This can be read in two ways:
  a) Strong reading (typical in temporal logic): at every time point (or in every state) event1 holds — i.e., event1 is true always.
  b) Weak reading: in every possible execution (trace) event1 occurs at least once.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the negation of whatever C1 asserts.

4) How the conditions relate (and final answer)
- Under the strong reading of C1 (event1 holds at all times): That is false. In the actual trace we have event1 at the start, then event2, then the system ends. After the initial step event1 does not continue to hold at later times, so ""always"" is false. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

- Under the weak reading of C1 (event1 occurs in every trace at least once): That is true, because the initial condition guarantees event1 occurs in the only possible trace. In that reading C1 is true and C2 is false.

Which reading is intended? The natural interpretation of the plain phrase ""Event1 always happens"" in temporal contexts is the strong one (holds at all times), so the appropriate conclusion is:
- C1 is false, and therefore C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: Interpreting ""Event1 always happens"" as holding at every time point, it fails — event1 occurs initially but is followed by event2 and does not hold thereafter. Therefore C1 is false and its negation C2 is true."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. at the initial state/event occurrence).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (the immediate next event is event2 or event3).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event3 follows event2).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — interpreted as “in a given state (or at a given step) event1 is not occurring.”
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately following the current one, event1 does not happen.

4) How the conditions relate / evaluation
- In the initial state event1 happened, so C1 is false in the initial state.
- By the rule “after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen,” the immediate next state must contain event2 or event3 — it cannot contain event1.
- Therefore in the next state event1 does not happen, so C1 is true in that next state.

Conclusion: C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is True. (This assumes the usual reading that “after X” means the immediate next event and events do not simultaneously reoccur in that next step.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: the initial state has event1; the rule “after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen” forces the immediate next state to contain event2 or event3 (not event1), so C1 (""event1 does not happen"") holds in that next state."

- In the initial state event2 already happened, so C1 is true in the initial state (event2 occurs at or before the current time).
- But because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" once we move to the next state (the state after the initial event2), there are no further events possible. From that next state there will be no occurrence of event2 in the future.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially (in the current state) event3 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. the immediate next state following event1 has event2).

- After event3, event1 must happen.

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e. the immediate successor state has event3).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalently, ""Event3 does not happen in the next state.""

4) Relation and evaluation
- Since the current state had event3, apply the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"": the next state must have event1.
- Therefore the next state does not have event3, so C1 is false and C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the current state (now) event3 happened.

(Assumption: states advance discretely and exactly one event happens per state, so “the next state” refers to the immediately following state.)

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (next state after event1 is event2).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (next state after event2 is event1 or event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (next state after event3 is event1 or event2).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state” (i.e., the immediately following state contains event3).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., event3 does not happen in the next state).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Given the current state had event3, the rule “after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen” restricts the next state to be event1 or event2. Therefore event3 cannot occur in the next state.
- Thus C1 is false and C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

Note: If you allowed multiple events to occur simultaneously in a state (so event3 could co-occur with event1 or event2), the interpretation would be different. Under the standard “exactly one event per state / either-or” reading used above, C2 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: event3 must happen (event3 will occur after any event2).
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens” — there is some future time (possibly immediately after the initial step) when event3 occurs.
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds” — the formula event1 ∨ C1; C2 is true if either event1 occurs at some point, or event3 eventually occurs (or both).

Step 4 — how they relate and final determination
- Since event2 has happened initially and the rule “after event2, event3 must happen” forces event3 to occur, C1 is true.
- C2 is event1 ∨ C1; because C1 is true, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether event1 ever happens.
- (Possible futures consistent with the rules: event2 → event3 → event1 (then stop), or event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → …. In both cases event3 occurs, so C1—and therefore C2—holds.)

Short answer: C2 is True (given the rules). Now step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
(These are liveness/transition rules meaning: whenever an event X happens, sometime later the specified next event must happen.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (There exists a future time at which event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 => (event3 eventually happens). (If event2 occurs, then eventually event3 will occur.)

4) How the conditions relate; truth values
- From the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 will occur.
- From event2 and the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"", event3 will occur. Therefore C1 is true in this system (event3 does eventually happen).
- C2 is true because the rule directly guarantees that whenever event2 happens, event3 follows (so event2 implies ""event3 eventually happens""). Note also that as a logical implication, C2 would be vacuously true if event2 never happened, but here event2 does happen and the implication still holds non-vacuously.

Conclusion: C2 is True (under the given interpretation that ""after X, Y must happen"" enforces eventual occurrence of Y).

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., the execution/run starts with event1 already having occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs then event3 will occur afterwards).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted as: in the given scenario/model, event2 occurs (in every run / from the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e., C1 is false (event2 does not always happen).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final truth value)?
- Since event1 is true initially and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no subsequent events (including event2) can ever occur in this run.
- Therefore event2 does not happen, so the claim C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules (interpretation: “After X, Y must happen” = whenever X happens, Y will happen next/afterwards)
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (non‑deterministic choice).
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” (i.e. both events occur at some points in the run)
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” Equivalently: if event1 occurs then (event2 occurs and event1 occurs). Since the antecedent already asserts event1, C2 really requires that whenever event1 occurs, event2 also occurs (somewhere).

Step 4 — how they relate / truth value of C2
- Start from the initial event2. After that, two possibilities:
  - Branch A: after event2 -> event1. Then after that event1 -> event2. So both event1 and event2 occur.
  - Branch B: after event2 -> event3. Then after event3 -> event1, and then after that event1 -> event2. So again both event1 and event2 occur.
- Thus from the initial event2 and the transition rules, event1 will inevitably occur (in every branch) and whenever event1 occurs it is followed by event2 (by the rule “after event1, event2 must happen”). Also event2 already happened initially. So C1 holds in all possible runs, and the implication in C2 is satisfied.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.
- Also given: after event2 no other events can happen, so the state in which event2 happened is terminal (there are no subsequent states with further events).

2) Transition rules
- After event3 → event1 must happen (if event3 ever occurs, the following state must contain event1).
- After event1 → no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 → no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 occurred initially and is terminal, nothing else can occur after the initial state. The rule about event3 → event1 is irrelevant here because event3 never occurs.

3) Meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting “always” as “for every state in the trace, event2 holds,” then in the actual (finite) trace we have only the initial state and event2 holds there, so C1 is true on that trace. (If “always” were intended as a stronger global claim about every possible execution or every future beyond termination, one would need a different interpretation; see note below.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” This asks whether the state immediately after the initial state satisfies C1 (i.e., whether in the next state event2 holds in every state of the remainder of the trace).

4) How the conditions relate and the answer
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, there is no next state with events after the initial state (the initial state is terminal).
- Therefore the Next(C1) condition (C2) is not satisfied: there is no next state in which C1 could hold. Under the usual interpretation of a “next” operator on a terminal state, Next(...) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Explanation: C1 holds in the initial (terminal) state because event2 happened there. But C2 is Next(C1) — it requires a next state in which C1 holds. There is no next state (event2 makes the initial state terminal), and under standard ""next"" semantics on a terminal state Next(...) is false. Hence C2 is false."

Step-by-step answer.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (If event3 occurs then eventually event1 will occur.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs then eventually event2 will occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs then eventually event1 will occur.)

(I read “after X, Y must happen” as the temporal implication X -> eventually Y.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted the same way as the third rule: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will later occur. So C1 is precisely the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This can be read two ways:
  a) As a statement that the implication C1 is true at some future time (i.e. eventually the property “event2 implies eventual event1” holds).
  b) As a statement that C1 will hold eventually because the system dynamics lead to situations where the implication is realized.

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- The third rule already states C1 as a system rule. So C1 is true (it is one of the given rules).
- Because C1 is already true from the rules, it “holds” now and therefore also “eventually holds.” Viewed either as a global rule or as an observed consequence of the run that starts with event1, C2 is true.
  - Concretely, from the initial event1 we get event2 (by the second rule), then from event2 we get event1 (by the third rule), and so on; whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows — exactly C1. So C2 (that C1 holds eventually) is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
1) Initial: event1 has happened.

2) Rules (interpreting ""after X, Y must happen"" as X -> eventually Y):
- event3 -> eventually event1
- event1 -> eventually event2
- event2 -> eventually event1

3) C1 is exactly the third rule (event2 -> eventually event1), so C1 is true already.

4) Since C1 holds now, it certainly ""eventually holds."" Therefore C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs then some later event is event2 or event3).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Interpreted as: at least one of event3 or event2 occurs at some point in the history.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" That is the disjunction of event3 with the statement C1.
(There is no C3 given in the hypothesis.)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because the initial condition states event3 happened, the atomic proposition ""event3 happens"" is true.
- Therefore C1 = (event3 or event2) is true (since event3 is true).
- C2 = (event3 or C1) is true as well (either because event3 is true or because C1 is true).
- Logically, C2 simplifies as event3 or (event3 or event2) = event3 or event2, so C2 is equivalent to C1 in this setting.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (it occurs at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 follows).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — logically C2 = (event2) ∨ (¬event1).

- From the initial condition, event2 does happen (true).
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, no subsequent event1 can occur; assuming ""initially"" means the start of the timeline, event1 never occurs, so C1 is also true.

Short answer: C2 is True (given the scenario described).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the start, and there are no prior events).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs, it blocks any later events).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, then at some later time event3 must occur).
- After event3, event2 must happen (if event3 occurs, then at some later time event2 must occur).
(The last two together would force an alternating occurrence of 2 and 3 if either were allowed to start.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (No occurrence of event3 anywhere in the timeline.)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In plain terms: if event1 occurs, then event3 does not occur.

4) How these relate / final reasoning
- Because event1 happened initially and the rule “after event1 no other events can happen” forbids any later events, neither event2 nor event3 can occur after that initial event1. Since event1 is the initial event, there is no earlier time for event3 to have happened. Therefore C1 is true in this scenario (event3 does not happen).
- Since the antecedent of C2 (event1 happens) is true in the given scenario and the consequent C1 is true, the implication C2 is true.

One caveat: if you allowed timelines where event3 could occur before event1, then “if event1 happens then event3 does not happen” would not necessarily hold universally; but with the stated initial condition (“Initially, event1 happened”) and the rule that no events can happen after event1, C2 is true.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2: no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1: event2 must happen (event1 → event2).
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen (event3 → (event1 or event2)).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (Formally: F(event2) — there is some time at or after now when event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (Formally: F(C1) = F(F(event2)) — at some time in the future, C1 will be true.)

4) Relation and evaluation
- Because event2 already happened initially, C1 is already true right now.
- Therefore C2 is true as well: since C1 holds now, it certainly holds ""eventually"" (at or before now). Also, in temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 ≡ C1; both have the same truth value.
- Note caveat: if you interpret ""eventually"" strictly as ""at some strictly later time"" (excluding the present instant), then C1 would still be true (because event2 already happened only if you allow ""eventually"" to include the past/present — but if strictly future, C1 might be considered false depending on semantics). Under the standard interpretation (eventually = at or after now), C2 is True.

Conclusion: Under the usual (standard) interpretation of ""eventually"", C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Short answer: True — C2 is true (given the usual reading that “after X” means “in the next state”).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event1 is true.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen in the next state. (If event1 holds at some state s, then at s+1 we must have event2 or event3.)
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event3: event2 must happen in the next state.
(Note: the last rule is repeated; it is redundant.)

(Assumption used: “after” = “in the immediately following state”.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “event2 happens or event3 happens.” Interpreted as a state formula: event2 ∨ event3 holds in a given state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” I.e., X(event2 ∨ event3) — in the state immediately after the current one, event2 or event3 holds.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / final reasoning?
- At s0 we have event1.
- The rule “after event1 … either event2 or event3 must happen” requires that in the next state s1 we have event2 ∨ event3.
- That is exactly C2: C1 (event2 ∨ event3) holds in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is true.

(If you meant a different temporal interpretation of “after” — e.g., “sometime later” rather than “next state” — the same immediate-step conclusion still follows because the rule guarantees at least the next state satisfies event2 ∨ event3.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so next ∈ {event2, event3}).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so next = event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so next ∈ {event1, event2}).
(One of the ""after event3"" sentences was repeated in the context; they say the same thing.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (Both occur at some points in the timeline.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ""Not (event2 happens and event1 happens)"". Since event2 is given to happen initially, C2 is equivalent to saying ""event1 does not happen.""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the rules, starting from the initial event2 the mandatory next is event3. From event3 you may choose event1 or event2.
- Therefore there exist timelines consistent with the rules in which event1 does happen:
  - Example where C1 holds (so C2 is false): event2 (initial) → event3 → event1 → ...
- There also exist timelines consistent with the rules in which event1 never happens:
  - Example where C1 does not hold (so C2 is true): event2 (initial) → event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ... (looping between event2 and event3 forever).
- Conclusion: Given only the supplied information, C2 is not decidable as true or false — it is not entailed nor refuted. Both C2 true and C2 false are possible under the rules. In other words, the truth of C2 is unknown/undetermined from the context.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the rules there exist valid timelines where event1 does occur (e.g. event2 → event3 → event1), so C2 (""event1 does not happen"") is not necessarily true."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 happened (i.e. event2 is true in the initial state).

2) Transition rules (interpretation: “after X” means in the next state after a state where X holds)
- After event1, no other events can happen → if event1 holds in a state, the next state has no events.
- After event2, no other events can happen → if event2 holds in a state, the next state has no events.
- After event3, event2 must happen → if event3 holds in a state, then event2 holds in the next state.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is just a redundant conjunction; it reduces to “event2 happens” (i.e. event2 holds in the current state).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” So C2 asserts that event2 holds in the state immediately following the current (initial) state.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- In the initial state event2 holds (so C1 is true in the initial state).
- But the rule “after event2, no other events can happen” says that from any state where event2 holds, the next state has no events — in particular, event2 does not hold in that next state.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.

(Note: an alternative semantics where “happened” is treated as a persistent past fact could change this conclusion, but under the usual interpretation that events hold at particular states and “after” refers to the next state, C2 is False.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happens first.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen. (3 → 1)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (1 → 2)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (2 → 1)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (I take this to mean: in the system runs allowed by the rules, event1 occurs repeatedly / at every required point — i.e. event1 does occur and in fact recurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (This is the implication C1 ⇒ (event3 occurs).)
- (No C3 was given; only C1 and C2 are relevant.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion about C2
- Starting from the initial event2, the rules force the sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... (because 2 → 1 and 1 → 2). So event1 does occur repeatedly in every continuation from the initial state. Thus C1 can be true in this system (event1 always happens in the run).
- Nothing in the rules forces event3 to ever occur: there is no transition that produces event3, and the only rule that mentions event3 is ""after event3, event1 must happen"" (which is triggered only if event3 actually happens).
- Therefore we can exhibit a valid run where C1 holds (the infinite alternating sequence 2,1,2,1,...) but event3 never happens. That is a counterexample to the implication C1 ⇒ event3.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial event2 the rules force the infinite sequence 2→1→2→1→... so C1 holds, but event3 never occurs in that run, so C1 ⇒ event3 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, a subsequent event3 will occur).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so event2 and event3 force each other and alternate).
- After event1, event3 must happen (i.e. whenever event1 occurs, a subsequent event3 will occur).

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens."" Interpreting this as the usual temporal implication: whenever event1 occurs, eventually event3 will occur afterwards. (This is exactly the same as the given rule “After event1, event3 must happen.”)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting this as: at some point in the execution (possibly immediately), the property C1 is true (or equivalently, there exists a time from which the implication in C1 is true).

Step 4 — how they relate and the truth of C2
- C1 is already guaranteed by the given rule “After event1, event3 must happen.” So C1 holds on all traces:
  - If event1 never occurs, the implication “if event1 then event3” is vacuously true.
  - If event1 does occur, the rule forces a subsequent event3, so the implication is satisfied.
- Therefore C1 holds immediately (it is true from the start / always true). Hence the statement “C1 eventually holds” (C2) is true — it holds right away.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 (whenever event1 occurs, eventually event3 occurs) is guaranteed by the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" (and is vacuously true if event1 never occurs). Hence C1 holds immediately, so ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2) is true."

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial state (call it s0): event3 happens.

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen. (So from any state with event3 the next state is event2.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (From event2 the next state is nondeterministically event1 or event3.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (From event1 the next state is event2.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — interpreted as a state proposition ¬event1 holding in the current state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e. Next(¬event1), or “in the state immediately following the current one, event1 does not happen.”

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Start at s0 where event3 happens (so ¬event1 is true at s0).
- The rule “after event3, event2 must happen” forces the next state s1 to be event2.
- In s1 (event2), event1 does not happen, i.e. ¬event1 holds in the next state.
- Therefore C2 (Next(¬event1)) is true in the initial state.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the current/initial state is event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, event2 must happen next.
So starting from the initial event2 the system will go: event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 … (event1 is not reached from that cycle).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (a proposition P: next-state event1)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” (the implication P → event1). Since C1 is precisely “event1 happens in the next state,” C2 is logically P → P.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- From the transitions, C1 is false (the next state is event3, not event1).
- C2 is the formula P → P, which is a tautology (always true). An implication of the form P → P is true regardless of whether P itself is true or false.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (written as implications)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen: event2 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event3).
- After event1, no other events can happen: event1 ⇒ no further events (in particular, no event2 or event3 can occur after event1).
- After event3, event2 must happen: event3 ⇒ event2.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens"" — formally (event3 ∨ event1).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — formally event2 ⇒ (event3 ∨ event1). This is exactly the same form as the given rule ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.""
- Note: an implication A ⇒ B is true if A never occurs (vacuous truth).

4) How they relate; final evaluation
- C1 is true because event1 has happened (so event1 ∨ event3 holds).
- C2 is true for two reinforcing reasons:
  a) It is directly stated by the context rule ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" (so C2 is entailed).
  b) Given event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur; therefore the implication event2 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event3) is vacuously true.

Therefore C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C2 is exactly the given rule ""after event2, event1 or event3 must happen,"" and in addition event2 cannot occur (event1 already happened and after event1 no further events can occur), so the implication is vacuously true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event3 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 → event3 happens.
- After event3 → event2 happens.
- After event2 → event3 happens.
These give a forcing chain: event3 (t0) ⇒ event2 (t1) ⇒ event3 (t2) ⇒ event2 (t3) … so event2 and event3 alternate after the initial event3. There is no rule that produces event1.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreting this as “event1 never occurs” (no initial occurrence and no rule generates it).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" i.e. (event1 never occurs) OR (event3 holds).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- We know event3 holds at time 0, and by the rules event3 reoccurs repeatedly (t0, t2, t4, ...). So the disjunction C2 is true already because event3 happens.
- Independently, since no rule produces event1 and it didn’t occur initially, event1 never occurs under the given rules, so C1 is also true. But you do not need C1 to be true to make C2 true because event3 alone makes the disjunction true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts just after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules (behavior / possible traces)
- From event1 the next step must be either event2 or event3.
- If event2 happens, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- If event3 happens, event1 must happen next (so event3 → event1 and the process can continue).
  
So the possible execution traces starting from the initial event1 are:
- event1 → event2 and stop (finite trace ending at event2), or
- event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → … (an infinite loop of event1 and event3, never reaching event2).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" As written, this is the propositional implication (event2 → event2). That is a logical tautology: any formula of the form P → P is always true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This says that at some future point (possibly now), C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Since C1 is a tautology (it holds in every state of every trace), C1 holds now and at every future point. Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.
- Conclusion: Under the literal reading of C1 given, C2 is True.

Note on possible ambiguity: If instead C1 were intended to mean ""event2 happens"" (i.e. C1 = “eventually event2” or C1 = “event2 occurs now/in the future”), then the answer can change. In that interpretation there exists a trace (the infinite event1↔event3 loop) where event2 never occurs, so ""event2 eventually happens"" would be false on that trace and hence ""C1 eventually holds"" would be false. But with the literal text you gave (event2 → event2), C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (E1), event2 (E2), event3 (E3).
- Initial condition: E3 has happened at the initial time (call it t0).

2) Transition rules (interpretation of “after X, Y must happen”)
- After E1 occurs, E2 must occur at some later time (E1 ⇒ eventually E2).
- After E2 occurs, E1 must occur at some later time (E2 ⇒ eventually E1).
- After E3 occurs, E1 must occur at some later time (E3 ⇒ eventually E1).

From the initial E3 at t0, the rules force at least one E1 at some t1 > t0, then an E2 at some t2 > t1, then E1 at t3 > t2, and so on. That produces an infinite alternating sequence of E1 and E2 after the initial E3. No rule requires E3 to occur again.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event3 happens and event3 happens.” This is redundant; it is equivalent to “E3 happens” (i.e., there is an occurrence of E3). Given the initial condition, C1 is true at time t0.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” This says that at some time (now or in the future) C1 is true.

4) How they relate and whether C2 is true
- If “eventually” is interpreted in the usual temporal-logic sense (F p), which is true if p holds now or at some future time, then C2 is true because C1 already holds at t0 (E3 happened initially).
- If “eventually” is interpreted strictly as “at some time strictly after now” (i.e., we require a future occurrence of E3 after t0), then C2 is false, because no rule forces E3 to occur again after the initial occurrence.

So: under the standard (non-strict) interpretation of eventually, C2 is True. Under a strict “future only” reading that excludes the current moment, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

(Reason: with the usual temporal-logic reading of ""eventually"" as ""now or later"", C1 already holds at the initial time because E3 has happened, so C2 is true. If ""eventually"" were required to mean ""strictly in the future"", then the answer would be False.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules and immediate consequences
- Rules given:
  - After event3, event1 must happen. (event3 → event1)
  - After event1, event3 must happen. (event1 → event3)
  - After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → event3)
- Consequences:
  - event1 and event3 mutually force each other, so once event1 occurs the system forces event3, which forces event1, etc.
  - If event2 ever occurs, it forces event3 and therefore (via the mutual rule) event1 as well.
- The initial event1 therefore implies event3 must occur (and then event1 again), independent of event2.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted in ordinary propositional logic this is p → p (a tautology) and is always true for any state/time. In temporal/operational reading there is a possible alternate meaning: ""If event2 happens now, then event2 must happen (again) later"" — i.e., event2 causes itself in the future. That is a different claim and is not given by the transition rules.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as the universal/temporal operator □C1 (C1 holds at all times/states).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Under the standard logical reading where C1 is the proposition p → p (tautology), C1 is true at every moment, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.
- Under the alternate temporal/causal reading where C1 asserts a self-transition (event2 → future event2), that is not implied by the given rules (we only have event2 → event3), so C1 would be False and therefore C2 would be False.

Final concise answer: C2 is True if C1 is interpreted as the tautology ""event2 → event2"" (the usual logical reading). If C1 is meant to assert a nontrivial temporal self-loop (that event2 forces a future event2), then C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the trace starts at a point where event2 has just occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event3 must happen (i.e., from any point where event2 has occurred, there will be a future occurrence of event3).
- After event3, event2 must happen (i.e., from any point where event3 has occurred, there will be a future occurrence of event2).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
These rules force 2 and 3 to alternate (possibly with intervening occurrences of event1, but those do not prevent the required occurrences).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: at the current point in the execution, there exists a future time where event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: at every point in the execution (i.e., at every time along the trace), C1 is true — from every point onward, event3 will eventually occur.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- From the initial event2, rule “after event2 → event3” guarantees event3 will occur next (so C1 is true initially).
- After event3 occurs, the rule “after event3 → event2” guarantees a future event2, and then that event2 guarantees a future event3. Thus from a state where the last event was 3, there is still a future event3 (after a 2). So from any point in the execution (whether the last event was 2, 3, or even 1), the rules ensure there will be a future event3.
- Therefore C1 holds at the initial point and holds at every subsequent point. Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true.

(If one changed the interpretation of ""after"" to allow some hypothetical rule that could permanently prevent any future 3 after some branching, the conclusion could differ; under the given rules the system forces eventual 3 from every reachable state, so C2 is true.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so every execution/trace starts with event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen (if event3 occurs then later event2 must occur).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (an occurrence of event2 is followed by at least one of event1 or event3).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — nothing can follow it).

Immediate consequence: because event1 occurs initially and is terminal, no further events can occur in any execution. That makes the rules about after event2 and after event3 irrelevant in the actual executions reachable from the given initial condition.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Read as “in every execution/trace, event1 occurs” (given the initial condition this is true: event1 occurs at the start of every trace).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” Formally: C1 ⇒ (event1 occurs). This is just the implication that if the property “event1 always happens” is true, then event1 does indeed occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and the answer about C2
- C2 is true. Reason: C2 is either trivially true as a logical implication (an implication with a true antecedent and true consequent, or vacuously true if the antecedent were false). More concretely here, C1 is true under the given initial condition (event1 does occur in every trace), so the antecedent of C2 holds and the consequent (event1 happens) also holds. Therefore C2 is true.

(Note: if you interpret “always happens” differently — e.g., “happens at every time point” or “happens infinitely often” — you should state that intended meaning; under the usual reading “occurs in every execution” the above conclusion stands.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (given)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → event3)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" This is exactly the rule event2 → event3.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the implication (C1 → event1). It says that the truth of C1 would guarantee that event1 happens.

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- From the rules and the initial fact event1:
  - event1 → event2, so event2 must happen.
  - event2 → event3 (C1), so event3 must happen.
  - event3 → event2, so event2 continues to hold (cycle).
  Thus C1 is true in this scenario (it matches a given rule), and event1 is also true (given initially).
- Therefore, as a material implication in the current scenario (C1 is true and event1 is true), the statement C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true.

Important distinction
- True in the current model: C2 is true because C1 is true here and event1 is true.
- Entailment/provability: C2 is NOT a logical consequence of the transition rules alone. C1 by itself does not imply event1; without the explicit initial fact event1, C1 would not force event1.

Final answer: C2 is true given the provided initial condition. However, C2 is not derivable from the transition rules alone.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state, event3 happened. Call that state s0 with event3(s0).

(Assumption: one event occurs per state and the “After X, Y must happen” rules mean “if X happens in a state, then in the immediately following state Y happens.”)

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event3 occurs in a state, the next state must have event1. (event3 → next event1)
- If event1 occurs in a state, the next state must have event3. (event1 → next event3)
- If event2 occurs in a state, the next state must have event3. (event2 → next event3)

From s0 (event3) the rules force: s1 must be event1, and then from s1 s2 must be event3, etc. So the system is forced into the repeating sequence: s0: event3, s1: event1, s2: event3, s3: event1, …

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state.” Formally, C1 at a state s means event3 holds at the immediate successor of s (next(event3)).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Formally, C2 at s means C1 is true at the successor of s, i.e. next(C1) which is equivalent to next(next(event3)) — event3 happens two steps from the current state.
(If there were a C3 it would mean next(next(next(event3))) and so on.)

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2 from the initial state s0
- C1 at s0: Is event3 true at s1? No — s1 is event1 (because event3 → next event1). So C1 at s0 is False.
- C2 at s0: Is C1 true at s1? C1 at s1 asks whether event3 holds at s2. From s1 (event1) the rule event1 → next event3 forces s2 = event3, so C1 at s1 is True. Therefore C2 at s0 is True.

Conclusion
- C1 (at the initial state) is False.
- C2 (at the initial state) is True.

True

Reason: From s0 (event3) the sequence is s1=event1, s2=event3. C2 asks whether event3 holds two steps ahead (next(next(event3))) — which it does at s2."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at time t0 (the initial state) event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 → event2 must occur in the next state.
- After event2 → event3 must occur in the next state.
- After event3 → event2 must occur in the next state.
So the timeline is:
t0: event1
t1: event2
t2: event3
t3: event2
t4: event3
… (alternating event2 and event3 forever after t1)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” This asserts event1 at t1.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” (An implication: C1 → (event1 happens).)
  — We must be careful about the time of the consequent. Two reasonable readings:
    a) The consequent refers to the same “next state” as C1 (i.e. C1 → event1@t1), which makes C2 the formula C1 → C1 (a tautology).
    b) The consequent refers to the current/initial state (i.e. C1 → event1@t0), which is a different claim.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the transition rules, event1 does NOT occur at t1, so C1 is false.
- Under standard logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Therefore:
  - If C2 is the implication C1 → event1 (with no extra temporal twist), C2 is true because C1 is false.
  - If C2 was intended as C1 → event1@t1, that is trivial true (p → p).
  - If C2 was intended as C1 → event1@t0, then C2 is also true vacuously because C1 is false (the antecedent doesn’t hold), so the implication holds.

Conclusion: Given the scenario, C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state), and C2 is true (the implication is true vacuously). If you meant C2 to express something else (for example a biconditional or a different time reference for the consequent), tell me the precise formalization and I’ll re-evaluate.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (the system starts with event1 having occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
So each listed event is terminal (once any of them occurs, the execution stops). Given the initial condition, the run is just event1 and then nothing else.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as the propositional implication P → P (where P = “event1 happens”). This is a logical tautology: P → P is true for every truth value of P.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says that the formula C1 is true in all states/times (i.e. globally true).

(There is no C3 in the hypothesis you gave.)

4) How they relate / conclusion
- Since C1 is a tautology (P → P), it is true in every possible state. Therefore saying ""C1 always holds"" is also true. The transition rules and the initial condition do not affect this logical fact — C1 does not depend on which events actually occur.
- Therefore C2 is True.

Note: If you intended a different reading (for example a temporal one like “if event1 occurs at some time then it will occur again later”), mention that and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is the tautology ""P → P"" (with P = ""event1 happens""), so it holds in every state; therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is true. If you instead meant a temporal claim like ""if event1 happens now then it happens again later,"" that would be different and may be false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (so at the initial moment/event the proposition “event3” is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1: event2 must happen.
- After event3: event2 must happen.
(These describe how events force other events to follow, but they are not needed to evaluate the given C1/C2.)

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally C1 is the implication event3 → event3.
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally C2 is event3 → C1, i.e. event3 → (event3 → event3).

Step 4 — how they relate and is C2 true?
- C1 is a logical tautology (A → A is always true in classical logic), so C1 holds in every possible state regardless of whether event3 actually occurs.
- Therefore C2, which is event3 → C1, is also true: the consequent C1 is true unconditionally, so the implication event3 → C1 is true in all cases.
- Another short demonstration: assume event3. Then the statement event3 → event3 holds (trivially). So under the assumption event3, C1 holds, which is exactly C2. Hence C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 (event3 → event3) is a tautology, so its truth does not depend on event3. Thus event3 → C1 is also true (an implication with a true consequent)."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (at least at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 → event1).
- After event1, event3 must happen (event1 → event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen (event3 → event1).
From these we get a cycle event3 → event1 → event3 … ; and if event2 ever occurs it forces event1 and then event3.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” (This contradicts the given initial condition, so C1 is false.)
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” Equivalently: event2 → (event3 does not happen).

(There is no C3 defined in the problem.)

4) How the conditions relate and verdict on C2
- Because event1 → event3 and event2 → event1, any occurrence of event2 would lead to event3 (event2 → event1 → event3). So if event2 happens the consequent of C2 (event3 does not happen) is false.
- Also, independently, C1 is already false because event3 did happen initially.

Therefore C2 is false: the implication fails in the case event2 occurs (antecedent true, consequent false). Note: only in the special case where you additionally assert “event2 never happens” would C2 be vacuously true; with the given rules and initial condition, C2 cannot be taken as true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C2 asserts event2 → (not event3). But event2 → event1 → event3, and event3 already occurred initially, so the consequent of C2 is false whenever event2 occurs; thus the implication is false (except vacuously if event2 never happens, which is not guaranteed)."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- From event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- From event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- From event3, the next event must be event1.
(You wrote the last rule twice; they are the same.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens"" — a state predicate true whenever the current event is event2 or event3.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — the temporal property F C1, i.e. there exists some time (now or in the future) when C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because the initial event is event2, C1 is already true at the initial time. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true immediately (the eventuality is satisfied now).
- Stronger fact: no infinite execution can avoid event2 or event3 after the start. From event3 you must go to event1, and from event1 you must go to event2 or event3, so you cannot stay at event1 forever. Thus event2 or event3 will recur infinitely often. So not only does C1 hold eventually, it holds repeatedly.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so “event2” is true at the start).

- After event3, event1 must happen. (3 → 1)

- In propositional logic, (¬E2 → E2) is equivalent to E2. (Because ¬(¬E2) ∨ E2 = E2 ∨ E2 = E2.)
- The initial condition states E2 is true, therefore C2 is true.
- Also, C1 is false in the actual history (since event2 did happen). Note: if you treated C1 as an assumed hypothesis (trying to force ¬E2), then C2 would assert event2 anyway, so ¬E2 and C2 cannot both hold; but that hypothetical is irrelevant to the given initial condition.

Stepwise answer.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e. at the initial time point, event2 occurred).

2) Transition (liveness) rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Formally: whenever event1 occurs, eventually event2 occurs.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, eventually event1 occurs.)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (Whenever event3 occurs, eventually event2 occurs.)

These are liveness obligations: occurrence of one event forces a future occurrence of another.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Formally C1 = F(event1) (there is some future time at which event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Formally C2 = F(C1) = F(F(event1)).

(There is no C3 given; you only asked about C1 and C2.)

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition (event2 has happened) and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" we immediately get C1: event1 will happen at some future time. So C1 is true.
- C2 is F(F(event1)). In temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p (an eventuality of an eventuality is just an eventuality). More simply: since C1 is already true now, there exists a time (the present) at which C1 holds, so ""eventually C1"" is also true. Therefore C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Stepwise reasoning:

1) Initial: event2 has occurred at the current time.  
2) Rule: ""after event2, event1 must happen"" means F(event1) holds now. So C1 (F(event1)) is true.  
3) C2 is F(C1) = F(F(event1)). In linear-time temporal logic F(F p) ≡ F p, and since C1 already holds now, ""eventually C1"" is also true.  
4) Therefore C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
So the rules form a cycle: 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 … ; given the initial event2, the cycle will continue (under the stated “must happen” rules).

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is the implication event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology (P → P), true whenever interpreted as an ordinary propositional/first-order implication at the same time point.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That asserts the formula in C1 is true at all times / in all states (i.e., it is valid/necessary).

Step 4 — how they relate and the conclusion
- C1 is a tautology (it is true in every possible state whether or not event2 actually occurs), so C1 does indeed hold universally.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Minor caveat: if the intended reading of C1 was temporal (e.g., “if event2 happens now, then event2 happens at some later time”), that would be a different statement and would need separate evaluation. Under the usual same-time reading of ""if P then P,"" C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is false (under the usual reading that events are instantaneous and ""after X"" forbids subsequent events).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (i.e. at the current/initial state event2 occurred).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""after X"" as ""in states after an occurrence of X"")
- After event1, event3 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, the next state must have event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately following the current one.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — i.e. either event2 occurs next, or event1 occurs (we assume this is meant for the same next-state/time scope).

4) How they relate and truth value
- Because event2 has just happened initially and the rule says ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no events can occur in the next state. Therefore:
  - C1 (event2 occurs in the next state) is false.
  - event1 (occurs in the next state) is false.
- C2 is the disjunction (C1 OR event1). With both disjuncts false, C2 is false.

Note on an alternative interpretation: If you instead interpret ""event2 happened"" as a persistent fact that remains true in the next state (i.e. events persist across states), then C1 would be true and hence C2 true. But under the standard instantaneous-event / ""after X"" = forbids further occurrences reading, C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 is terminal, so in the next state neither event2 (C1) nor event1 can occur; both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.

2) Transition rules (interpreting “After X, Y must happen” as “the next event after X must be Y” or one of the listed Ys)
- After event1, event3 must happen. So the only successor of event1 is event3.
- After event3, event1 must happen. So the only successor of event3 is event1.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. So successors of event2 are {event1, event3}.
(Two identical statements about “after event3, event1 must happen” are redundant.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Interpreted as: event2 never occurs in the run/sequence.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Interpreted naturally as: at some point in time (or from some point onward) the proposition C1 is true. If C1 is true from the start (event2 never occurs at any time), then C1 certainly “eventually holds.”

4) How the conditions relate (derivation)
- From the transition rules and the initial event1, the reachable sequence is forced: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → … (an infinite alternating cycle of 1 and 3).
- There is no rule that allows a transition to event2 from event1 or event3, so event2 is never reachable after the initial event1. Since the initial event is event1 (not event2) and no transition can produce event2, event2 never occurs in the run.
- Therefore C1 (“event2 does not happen”) is true (it holds globally).
- If C1 holds globally, then it certainly holds at some time (indeed from the start), so C2 (“C1 eventually holds”) is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: The initial event is event1, and the transition rules force the only possible infinite run event1 → event3 → event1 → …, with no transitions to event2. Thus event2 never occurs (C1 holds globally), so C1 certainly ""eventually holds"" (C2 is true)."

True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 has already happened, so C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true right away.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no future can avoid that already-occurring event1; there is no execution where event1 never happens.
- Any other rules (e.g., after event3 → event1 or event2, and after event2 → event1) do not produce a trace without event1.

Therefore C1 holds in every possible execution, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is True."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event3 must occur in the next state.
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur in the next state.
- After event1 occurs, no other events can occur thereafter.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is a proposition about whatever state you evaluate it in (e.g., in state S it means ¬(event2 holds in S)).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In temporal form: next(C1) — i.e., in the immediate successor state of the current state, event2 does not happen.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Start at S0: event2 happens, so C1 is false at S0.
- By the rules, the next state S1 must have event3. Therefore in S1 event2 does not happen, so C1 is true in S1.
- Since C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, and we have shown C1 is true in S1, C2 is true.

So C2 is True (even though C1 is false in the initial state).

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially (in the current state) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., in the immediate next state after event2, event1 occurs).
- After event1, event3 must happen (in the next state after event1).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (in the next state after event3).

(Assumption: “after X” means the immediate next state, and “must” is a deterministic requirement.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — claims that the immediate successor state contains event2.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — claims that event2 does NOT happen in the next state (i.e., ¬C1).

4) How the conditions relate / evaluation
- Given the initial state contains event2 and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” the immediate next state must contain event1.
- Therefore the next state does not contain event2, so C1 is false.
- Since C2 is the negation of C1, C2 is true.

If you use a different interpretation of “next” (e.g., some later state instead of immediate successor) say so and I can re-evaluate.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial state s0: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (reading “after E” as “in the next state following a state where E happened”)
- If event3 occurs at time t then event2 must occur at t+1.   (3 -> next 2)
- If event2 occurs at time t then at t+1 either event1 or event3 occurs.   (2 -> next (1 or 3))
- If event1 occurs at time t then event2 must occur at t+1.   (1 -> next 2)

3) Meaning of C1 and C2 (interpretation used here)
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state” — interpreted as: in the state immediately after the initial state (i.e. at s1) event3 occurs.
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds” — interpreted as the implication: whenever event2 happens at some state t, then event3 happens in the next state (t+1). (Equivalently: event2 -> next event3.)

4) How the conditions relate; why C2 is false
- From s0 (event1) and the rule 1 -> next 2, we get s1 must have event2. So C1 (that s1 has event3) is already false in this model — s1 is event2, not event3.
- More generally, the rule for event2 only requires that the next state be either event1 or event3. It does not force event3. So the implication event2 -> next event3 is not guaranteed.
- Counterexample trace respecting all rules:
  - s0: event1
  - s1: event2    (forced by 1 -> next 2)
  - s2: event1    (allowed because 2 -> next (1 or 3))
  This shows event2 at s1 is followed by event1 at s2, not event3, so C2 fails.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred (at least once at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (every time event2 occurs it is followed by event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (every time event3 occurs it is followed by event1 or event2).

From these you can generate sequences such as: event2 → event3 → event1 (then stop), or event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → … (possibly repeating), etc.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is the proposition p → p with p = “event3 happens.” That is a tautology (always true whenever interpreted as a standard material implication).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Read as: if the statement C1 is true, then (somewhere in the system/run) event2 happens.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- C1 is true (tautologically true).
- Given the initial condition, event2 does indeed happen (it happened initially). Even without relying on the initial fact, the transition rules allow event2 to occur repeatedly after event3, so event2 occurs in the system.
- Therefore the antecedent of C2 (C1 holds) is true and the consequent (event2 happens) is true, so the implication C2 is true.

Hence C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 (""if event3 happens then event3 happens"") is a tautology, so the antecedent of C2 is true. The system's initial condition already has event2 occurring (and transitions also allow event2 to occur later), so the consequent ""event2 happens"" is true. Hence the implication C2 is true."

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., it is not the case that both event3 and event2 happen.

- Therefore C1 is true (both events happen), and C2 (the negation of C1) is false.

Step 0 — assumption
- I will read each ""After ..."" as a requirement about the immediate next state (i.e., ""after"" = next-state). If you meant “eventually after” instead, say so and I’ll re-evaluate.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state S0), event1 happened (event1 is true in S0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen → if a state has event1, then the next state must have event2.
- Rule B: After event2, event3 must happen → if a state has event2, then the next state must have event3.
- Rule C: After event3, no other events can happen → if a state has event3, then the next state has no events (or no further events occur).

Using these rules and the initial state S0:
- S0: event1 (given).
- By Rule A, S1 (the next state) must have event2.
- By Rule B, S2 must have event3.
- By Rule C, after S2 there are no further events.

So the timeline (states) is:
S0: event1
S1: event2
S2: event3
(and then no further events)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a tautological repetition and simplifies to ""event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 is true in the referenced state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks: is C1 (i.e., event2) true in the next state?

(There is no C3 given in your hypothesis.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other — is C2 True or False?
- We need to check whether event2 is true in the next state after the initial state S0.
- From the initial condition S0: event1, and Rule A says the next state must have event2. Therefore S1 has event2.
- Hence C1 (event2) holds in the next state S1.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.

Answer: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From S0 (event1), Rule A forces S1 to have event2. C1 simplifies to ""event2"". C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., S1), which it does."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” Interpreting “after” as the immediate successor: event2 is terminal — once event2 occurs, there is no successor state with any event.
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards.
- “After event3, no other events can happen.” event3 is also terminal.

(If “after” were meant as “eventually after” rather than “immediately after,” the same conclusion below still follows under the usual interpretations; I note any alternate reading at the end.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” This is a property of a given state S: C1(S) is true iff in S’s immediate successor state the event that happens is event2.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” This means there exists some future state S' (including possibly the current one, depending on convention) such that C1(S') is true — i.e., at some point we reach a state whose successor has event2.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- We start in the initial state where event2 has just happened. By the rule “after event2, no other events can happen,” that state is terminal: there is no successor state in which any event occurs.
- Therefore in the initial state C1 is false (the next state does not contain event2 — there is no next state with events).
- Since no events can ever happen after the initial event2, no future state exists in which its successor contains event2. So C1 is never true in any state.
- Hence there is no future state where C1 holds, so “C1 eventually holds” (C2) is false.

Alternate-reading note: If one instead read “after event2, no other events can happen” as allowing repeated occurrences of event2 indefinitely (that would contradict “no other events”), or if “after” in “after event1, event2 must happen” were only eventual and there were ways to revisit states before the initial event2, the situation could differ. But under the natural reading given (initially event2 and event2 is terminal), C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules (from the natural-language statements)
- After event1, no other events can happen → any state where event1 happened has no successor (it is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen → any state where event2 happened is terminal.
- After event3, event2 must happen → if event3 happens in a state, then that state must have a successor in which event2 happens.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is the formula (event3 → event3), which is a logical tautology (always true) in any single state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally this is X C1 (the next-time operator): at the current state C2 is true iff there exists a next state and C1 is true in that next state (under standard linear-time semantics Xφ requires a successor and φ to hold there).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- C1 is true in every state because it is a tautology.
- But C2 requires a next state. The initial state has event1 and, by the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" has no successor. Under the usual semantics for the next operator, Xφ is false at a state with no successor. Therefore C2 is false in the initial state.

Conclusion: C2 is False. (If you used a different semantics for ""next""—e.g. vacuous truth at dead-ends—the answer could differ, but under the standard temporal-logic reading, C2 is false.)

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the current state, in the immediately following state C1 is true (so the next state has event1 or event2).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other? Is C2 True or False?
- Build the state sequence starting from the initial state:
  - state0 (initial): event3.
  - state1 (next): by rule after event3 → event2.
  - state2: after event2 → event1.
  - state3: after event1 → event2.
  - then alternating event1, event2 forever.
- Evaluate C2 at the initial state: C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state (state1). State1 has event2, so C1 (event1 or event2) is true there. Therefore C2 is True.
- More strongly: from any state in this system the next state will always contain event1 or event2 (after 3 → 2, and 1↔2 alternate), so C2 holds in every state — in particular it holds in the initial state.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the current/initial state is one where the last event was event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen (so every successor of a state labeled event2 is labeled event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (successor of event3 is event1 or event2).
- After event1, event3 must happen (successor of event1 is event3).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" — from a given state there is some (current or future) point at which event3 occurs. (In temporal logic notation: F(event3).)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the property C1 is true when evaluated at the immediate successor state. (In temporal logic: X C1.)

4) How they relate and proof that C2 is True
- From the initial state (event2), the rule forces event3 to happen next, so C1 is true at the initial state.
- Consider the next state (it is a state where event3 has just occurred). We need to check whether event3 eventually happens from that state:
  - From event3 the next event is either event1 or event2.
  - If the next is event1, then by the rule after event1, event3 must happen afterward.
  - If the next is event2, then by the rule after event2, event3 must happen afterward.
  - In both cases, event3 will occur again in the future. Also, event3 already holds in the current (next) state.
- Therefore C1 (event3 eventually happens) is true when evaluated at the next state. That is exactly C2, so C2 is true.

So C2 = True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start of the scenario).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1, if it occurs, must be terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event3 follows event2).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “event2 happens and event1 happens” (both occurred at some points).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e., it is not the case that both event2 and event1 happened).

4) How they relate / deduction
- event2 did happen (given).
- Could event1 have happened before event2? No — if event1 had happened before, then by “after event1 no other events can happen” event2 could not have occurred afterward, contradicting the given that event2 did happen.
- Could event1 have happened after event2? No — after event2 event3 must happen, and after event3 no other events can happen, so there is no place for event1 to occur after event2.
- Therefore event1 could not have happened at any time in this scenario.

Thus C1 is false (event1 did not happen), so C2 (C1 does not hold) is true.

  - (No C3 is given in the problem.)

4) How the conditions relate and whether C2 is true
- Because C1 is a tautology (always true), the implication event2 → C1 has a true consequent. An implication with a true consequent is always true, so C2 is true.
- Another quick view by cases on event2:
  - If event2 is false (doesn't happen), event2 → C1 is vacuously true.
  - If event2 is true (happens), C1 is true (since event2 → event2 is true), so event2 → C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 holds (is true) regardless of the transition rules or whether event2 actually occurs.

2) What are the transition rules?

- After event2, event3 must happen. (So event2 is followed by event3.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (Not used here because event1 is never stated to occur initially.)

Given the first two rules, once event3 happens you get event2 next, and after event2 you get event3 next — so the system will alternate indefinitely between event3 and event2 (unless event1 ever appears, which we have no reason to assume).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally this is event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology (an instance of p → p): it is true in every state regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- Since C1 is a tautology, C1 is true at every time instant (including the initial state). Therefore ""eventually C1"" is satisfied immediately — C1 already holds now and hence holds eventually.
- Conclusion: C2 is True.

(Additional note: even without appealing to tautology, the system’s behavior contains event2 repeatedly, so any nontrivial reading of ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"" would also be satisfied. But the decisive point is that C1 is logically valid, so C2 holds.)

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.

From these rules, the only actual timeline given the initial condition is: event2 happened and then nothing else (because event2 is terminal). So event1 and event3 never happen in this scenario.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the initial event2 and the terminal nature of event2, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Written as (event1) → (not event1). This is a material implication whose consequent is C1 (not event1).

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Since C1 is true in the model, any implication with C1 as the consequent is true. Also, in propositional logic (p → ¬p) is equivalent to ¬p, so C2 is logically equivalent to C1. Because event1 does not happen here, C2 is true (vacuously true if you prefer the antecedent-false view, or true because its consequent is true). 

So C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 (""not event1"") is true in the given model (event2 happens and is terminal, so event1 never happens). Hence the implication (event1 → not event1) is true (an implication with a true consequent is true). Equivalently, (p → ¬p) is logically equivalent to ¬p, so C2 and C1 are both true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event3 happened (so event3 is true in S0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 holds in some state, the next state must have event1).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (the next state must have event2 or event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (the next state cannot have any events).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" Formally, from a state s, C1(s) = event3 holds in the immediate successor of s.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Formally, C2 means for every reachable state s, C1(s) is true (i.e., in every state the next state has event3).

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- We evaluate C1 in the initial state S0 (where event3 holds). The rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" says the successor of S0 has no events at all. Therefore event3 does not hold in the next state, so C1 is false at S0.
- Since C2 asserts that C1 holds in every state, and we already have a state (S0) where C1 is false, C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If one tried a different reading of ""no other events can happen"" meaning ""no events other than event3 can happen"" then the rules would allow event3 to repeat and C1 might hold; but with the usual reading ""no events at all can occur after event3"" the answer above applies.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From S0 (event3 holds) the successor has no events, so C1 (""event3 in the next state"") is false at S0. Since C2 requires C1 to hold in every reachable state, C2 is false."

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially (at the start) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules / constraints
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any continuation of the run contains event1 after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is also terminal).

Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the only possible extension is that event1 occurs (and then the run stops). Therefore event3 cannot occur in any valid execution.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a conditional property. In our setting, it can be read as “whenever event3 occurs, event2 has (or will have) occurred” or more simply as the implication event3 ⇒ event2.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting this in the usual sense—there is some point (or from some point onward) at which C1 is true. Since C1 is a statement about occurrences of events, if it is true at the start it already “eventually holds.”

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Because event3 cannot occur in any allowed run (it would prevent the required event1 from happening after event2), the antecedent of C1 (event3) is never true. An implication with a never-true antecedent is vacuously true, so C1 holds.
- Since C1 holds immediately (and hence at some future point), ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Thus C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: The system must start with event2 and then (by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"") do event1 and terminate. Thus event3 can never occur in any valid execution. The formula C1 (event3 ⇒ event2) is therefore vacuously true in every reachable state (its antecedent never holds), so C1 already holds and hence ""eventually holds."" Therefore C2 is True."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 ⇒ next is event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (event3 ⇒ next is event1 or event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 ⇒ no events occur afterwards; the state following event1 has no events).

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e., if event3 is the next event, then event1 happens — presumably in some specified next step.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Because initially event1 happened and the rule “after event1, no other events can happen” applies, there cannot be any event in the next state. In particular, C1 (event3 in the next state) is impossible / false in this context.
- The implication C2 (""if C1 then event1"") therefore has a false antecedent under the given context. In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- Caveat: if you drop the ""initially event1"" / ""after event1 no further events"" facts and ask whether ""event3 ⇒ event1"" holds in every possible situation allowed by the other rules, the answer would be no — after event3 the rules allow either event1 or event2, so event1 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion: Given the full context you provided (initially event1 and after event1 no further events), C2 is true (vacuously true because C1 cannot occur). If instead you meant to ask whether event3 necessarily leads to event1 in general, that is false.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so we start in a state ""after event2"").

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — event1 is terminal.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — event2 is terminal.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" — event3 is terminal.
So whenever any of those events has occurred, the system cannot move to any state with another event afterward.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" — asserts that immediately following the initial state, event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — asserts that event3 does not happen in the next state.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Since we start in a state where event2 has already happened, and rule says no events can happen after event2, there is no possible next state in which any event (including event3) happens.
- Therefore C1 (event3 happens next) is false.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: The initial state is ""after event2"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" so event3 cannot happen next (C1 is false), hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true."

3) What the sub-conditions mean

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (the implication: C1 ⇒ event2).

4) How they relate and truth value of C2
- Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, no other events can occur after it. So in the given scenario event3 does not (and cannot) occur. Thus C1 is false in the given context.
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event2."" In our context event2 is true (it happened initially). An implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent, so C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

True.

- Start: event2 occurs.
- By the rule after event2, event3 must occur next → event3 happens.
- By the rule after event3, event1 must occur next → event1 happens.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened first.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, no further events can happen (terminal).
(One of the sentences is duplicated in the context; it has no extra effect.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant way of saying ""event1 happens"" (at least once).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. event1 does not happen at all.

Step 4 — how they relate (and truth of C2)
- From the rules, starting from the initial event2 there are two allowed immediate continuations:
  - e2 → e1 → ... (so event1 does occur in this run),
  - e2 → e3 (terminal, so event1 does not occur in this run).
- Therefore both possibilities are allowed by the context. C1 holds in some allowed sequences and fails in others.

Conclusion about C2
- C2 is not determinately true or false given the context. It is satisfiable (true in runs where e2 → e3) and falsifiable (false in runs where e2 → e1 …). So the truth of C2 is contingent — it can be true in some models and false in others.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the initial e2 you can follow e2→e1 (so C1 holds and C2 is false) or e2→e3 (so C1 fails and C2 is true). C2 is therefore not guaranteed true in the context, so the claim ""C2 is True"" is false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has occurred initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event2 must happen (i.e., from any state where event3 just occurred the system will produce event2 at some future point — typically immediately next).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This asserts that from the current state, there will be a future state in which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the immediate successor state (the state after the current one), the property C1 is true — i.e., from that successor state event2 will eventually happen.

4) How do these conditions relate and the final verdict?
- From the initial state (where event3 has occurred) the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" guarantees that event2 will occur in the future. So C1 is true in the initial state.
- Consider the next state (the immediate successor of the initial state). That state is exactly the situation ""after event3"", from which event2 is guaranteed to occur (and may already have occurred in that successor). Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is also true in the next state.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. in every allowed execution/run, event1 is already true at the start).

2) Transition rules (what each statement means and immediate consequences)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" → event2 is terminal: if event2 occurs, it is the last event.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, nothing can occur afterward.
- ""After event3, event1 must happen."" → if event3 occurs, then sometime after it event1 must occur (so a possible sequence is event3 then event1 then stop).

Combine these with the initial condition: since event1 already happened initially and event1 is terminal, no other events can occur after the start. Therefore event2 and event3 cannot occur in any allowed run (they are ruled out by the initial event1 which forbids any subsequent events).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (conjunction: both occur somewhere in the execution).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → (event2 ∧ event1). This is equivalent to event2 → event1 (because A → (A ∧ B) is equivalent to A → B).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 is false in the given model: event1 is true but event2 never happens, so (event2 ∧ event1) is false.
- C2 is true in the given model:
  - Reason 1 (vacuous truth): there is no allowed run where event2 happens (because initial event1 prevents any further events), so the implication ""if event2 happens → ..."" is vacuously true.
  - Reason 2 (equivalent form): C2 says event2 → event1. But event1 is true (initially) in every run, so any occurrence of event2 (which in fact cannot occur) would still be accompanied by event1; hence the implication holds.

Therefore C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 holds initially (and is terminal), so event2 cannot occur — making the implication vacuously true; equivalently, event1 is true in every run, so event2 → event1 (hence event2 → (event2 ∧ event1)) holds."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (if event3 occurs, it must be followed by event1 or event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
(Note: the last rule is repeated in the context; it is the same constraint twice.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (i.e., in every possible execution/trace, event3 occurs at some point.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., it is not the case that event3 always happens — there exists at least one execution where event3 does not occur.)

4) How the conditions relate, and evaluation
- From the rules and the initial condition, a valid execution is: event1 (initial) → event2 (required after event1) → end (no further events allowed after event2). This execution contains no event3.
- Because there exists at least one valid trace with no event3, the statement ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Therefore C2, which is the negation of C1, is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (we start in a state after event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen (i.e., every successor of a state labeled event3 is a state where event1 occurs next).
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next (nondeterministically one of the two).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: from the current state, at some future step (possibly the current one) event1 will occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted as: in the immediately following state, the property C1 is true (i.e., from that next state, event1 will eventually happen).

4) How they relate / reasoning
- Start: we are in a state after event2. From event2 the next state must be either event1 or event3.
  - If the next state is event1, then event1 occurs immediately in that next state, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true there.
  - If the next state is event3, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" guarantees that from that next state event1 will happen shortly afterward, so again ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true there.
- In both possible next states C1 holds, so C1 is true of the next state. Therefore C2 is true.

Assumption: rules are obligations that hold on all possible transitions; ""eventually"" means at some finite future step on the same run.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From the initial state (after event2) the next state is either event1 or event3. If it's event1, event1 already occurs there. If it's event3, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 occurs in the successor of that state. Thus in every possible next state, event1 will occur at some future step, so C1 holds in the next state."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (C1 = event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (C2 = event1 ⇒ C1). (There is no C3 given.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / truth evaluation?
- Because event3 happened initially and no events can happen after event3, neither event1 nor event2 can occur in the scenario. So C1 (event1 ∨ event2) is false.
- C2 is the implication event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2). That implication is logically valid (indeed p ⇒ (p ∨ q) is a tautology) and, in this scenario, its antecedent (event1) is false, so the implication is true (vacuously true). Therefore C2 is True.

Short answer to the question asked: C2 is True.

True

Reason: C2 is the implication event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2), which is a logical tautology (and in this scenario the antecedent is false because event3 already occurred), so the implication is true."

Step-by-step answer.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event3 no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
From the initial event2 we get a mandatory event1 next, and from that either event2 (loop) or event3 (terminate). So possible traces start: event2 → event1 → (event2 → event1 → …) or event2 → event1 → event3 (then stop).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is true in our system because event2 already happened initially (and may reoccur later).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the implication (C1 → event2 happens). Interpreted literally, it says: if event2 eventually happens, then event2 happens (i.e., event2 occurs). Given C1’s plain meaning, the antecedent is that event2 does occur at some point; the consequent is that event2 occurs. (They are essentially the same factual claim under the usual reading.)

4) How the conditions relate and final verdict
- C1 is true (event2 did happen initially).
- C2 is the implication ""if event2 eventually happens then event2 happens."" With our reading, both antecedent and consequent are true, so the implication is true. Therefore C2 is True.

(If you intended a different meaning of ""event2 happens"" versus ""event2 eventually happens"" — e.g., distinguishing “happens right now” from “happens at some future time” — say so and I’ll re-evaluate with that precise temporal interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Step-by-step:

1) Initial fact: event2 has happened (at the start).  
2) Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true.  
3) C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event2 happens."" Interpreting both occurrences of ""event2 happens"" the same way (i.e., as “event2 occurs at some point”), the antecedent and consequent are the same factual claim. With the antecedent true and the consequent true, the implication is true.  
4) (Caveat) If you intended a different temporal reading (e.g. antecedent = “event2 occurs sometime” but consequent = “event2 occurs immediately right now”), re-evaluate under that precise meaning.

- Events: event1, event2, event3.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen (so every time event1 occurs, event3 follows).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (choice).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (Here the natural reading is: in every possible execution/run starting from the initial condition, event3 occurs — i.e. event3 inevitably happens in every run.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" — i.e. whenever a run contains event2, the statement C1 (that event3 happens in every run) is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because the run starts with event1 and the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur immediately, every possible run contains event3. Example runs:
  - Looping run: event1, event3, event1, event3, ... (event3 occurs repeatedly).
  - Terminating run: event1, event3, event2 (event3 occurred before the terminal event2).
- Therefore C1 (event3 occurs in every run) is true.
- Since C1 is true independently of whether event2 occurs, the implication in C2 (""if event2 happens then C1 holds"") is also true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (one of them occurs next).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so event3 → event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e. ¬event3).
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event3 → C1, which expands to event3 → ¬event3.

Note: the implication event3 → ¬event3 is logically equivalent to ¬event3 (because an implication P → ¬P can only be true when ¬P is true).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- Possible valid sequences given the rules:
  1. event1 → event2 (then stops). Here event3 does not happen, so C1 is true in this trace.
  2. event1 → event3 → event2 (then stops). Here event3 does happen, so C1 is false in this trace.
- Because sequence (2) is allowed by the rules, event3 can occur. That makes C1 false (not universally true).
- Therefore C2 (event3 → ¬event3) is false as well, because there is an allowed trace where the antecedent (event3) is true but the consequent (¬event3) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

False.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (it has happened).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (one of them occurs next).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" — i.e., either event3 happens, or event2 does not happen (a disjunction).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the rules: starting at event1, the only possible continuations are
  a) event1 → event3 (then stop), or
  b) event1 → event2 → event3 (then stop).
- In both possible runs event3 happens. Thus event3 is guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 (""event3 happens or event2 does not happen"") is true (the left disjunct holds in every case).
- C1 by itself is not guaranteed (there is a possible run where event2 does happen), but C2 is still true because event3 always happens.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From event1 the only possible runs are (1) event1 → event3, or (2) event1 → event2 → event3. In both runs event3 happens, so the disjunction ""event3 happens or event2 does not happen"" is always satisfied."

I'll assume ""after X, Y must happen"" means ""if X holds in a state t, then Y holds in the immediate next state t+1."" With that interpretation:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at state0, event1 happened (event1 holds at state0).

2) Transition rules (immediate next-state rules)
- If event2 holds at t, then event3 holds at t+1.
- If event3 holds at t, then event2 holds at t+1.
- If event1 holds at t, then event3 holds at t+1.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at a state s, C1 means event2 holds at s+1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At state s, C2 means that at s+1 the property C1 is true; i.e., event2 holds at s+2.

4) How the conditions relate (step-by-step timeline from the initial state0)
- state0: event1 (given).
- state1 (next after state0): by rule for event1 → event3, event3 holds.
- state2 (next after state1): by rule for event3 → event2, event2 holds.
- state3 (next after state2): by rule for event2 → event3, event3 holds.
  (and so on alternating event2/event3 thereafter)

Now evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial state0:
- C1 at state0 asserts event2 holds at state1. From the timeline, state1 has event3, not event2, so C1 is false at state0.
- C2 at state0 asserts that C1 holds at state1 — equivalently that event2 holds at state2. From the timeline, event2 does hold at state2, so C2 is true at state0.

Answer: C2 is True (while C1 is False at the initial state).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: state0 has event1, so state1 has event3 (from event1→event3), and state2 then has event2 (from event3→event2). C2 asserts event2 at state2, so C2 is true at state0."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened (call that state S0).

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so if a state has event1, the next state has event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 and event2 force each other in alternation).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next (so from S0 you go to a state with event1 or a state with event2).

(Implicit assumption: one event happens per state and “after X” means “in the next state”.)

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” That means in S1 we have event1.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event3 happens.” Read as: if S1 has event1, then (at some relevant time) event3 happens. Interpreting it in the natural temporal way as “event3 happens at/after the next state” (or at least at some future state).

4) How do they relate and conclusion about C2?
- Start S0: event3. If C1 is true, S1 = event1. By the rules, after event1 the next state S2 must be event2, then S3 must be event1, etc. The system will alternate event1 ↔ event2 forever and there is no rule forcing event3 to ever reoccur. Therefore C1 being true does not imply event3 will happen later. A concrete trace: S0:event3, S1:event1 (C1 true), S2:event2, S3:event1, ... — event3 never appears again. So C2 is false.

(If you intended a different interpretation of “happens” — e.g., “happened previously” or “happens simultaneously” or multiple events per state — say so and I’ll re-evaluate under that semantics.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at least once, at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
(These are rules about what must follow each event; they do not conflict with the given initial event2.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" In propositional form, C1 is P → P where P = “event2 happens.” This is a logical tautology (always true).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" In symbols, C2 is (P → P) → P.

(There is no C3 given in the hypothesis.)

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- Since P → P is a tautology, C1 holds (is true) in every situation.
- Therefore C2 reduces to: true → P, which is logically equivalent to P itself (so C2 is true exactly when event2 happens).
- The context tells us event2 happened initially, so P is true.
- Hence C2 is true.

Extra note: If the context did not assert that event2 actually occurs, C1 would still be true but C2 could be false (because C2 asserts that event2 happens). Here, because the initial condition gives event2, C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially (call this state s0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen in the next state.

These make a deterministic timeline from s0: s0 (event1) → s1 (event2) → s2 (event3) → ...

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at a given state s, C1 means event3 holds at the immediate successor of s (i.e. X event3).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted at state s, C2 means that at the successor of s, C1 is true. So C2 is X(C1) which is equivalent to XX(event3): event3 holds two steps ahead.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At s0: next state s1 has event2, so C1 at s0 (i.e. event3 at s1) is false.
- At s1: next state s2 has event3 (by the rule after event2), so C1 at s1 is true.
- Therefore at s0, C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true because C1 is true at s1.

Conclusion: Given the initial condition and the rules, C2 is True. (Formally C2 corresponds to ""event3 holds two steps from now,"" which follows from event1 → event2 → event3.)

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (this is given as the starting fact).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (so once event3 occurs, the sequence ends).
- After event2, event1 must happen.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (i.e., event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (i.e., (event2 ∧ event1) → event2).

4) How they relate / evaluation of C2
- Logically, any conjunction implies each of its conjuncts. From (event2 ∧ event1) you can infer event2. So the conditional (event2 ∧ event1) → event2 is a tautology and therefore True.
- Note about the context: given the transition rules, C1 may be impossible in an actual timeline (since event1 forces event3 and then no further events, so event2 cannot occur after event1). Whether C1 is impossible or not doesn't change the truth of C2: if C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true; if C1 were true, it would still entail event2 by construction.

Therefore C2 is True.

I'll go through the four requested parts step by step, point out an ambiguity, then give the final verdict.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2: event3 must happen next.
- After event3: event1 must happen next.
(The duplicate line ""After event3, event1 must happen."" is redundant.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is ambiguous unless we fix a formal meaning:
  - Interpretation A (strong): event1 holds at every time step (i.e., in every state of the run).
  - Interpretation B (standard liveness reading): in every execution/event trace, event1 inevitably occurs (and here in fact will recur infinitely often).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1 under whichever interpretation we choose.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and the final answer)?
- Starting from the initial event2, the forced transitions give the only possible traces:
  event2 -> event3 -> event1 -> (then either event2 or event3) -> ...
  If after event1 you choose event2, you get event2 -> event3 -> event1 again; if you choose event3, you get event3 -> event1 immediately. In either case, event1 reappears. So every possible infinite trace starting from the initial event2 contains event1 repeatedly (in particular at positions 3, then again at 6 or 4 depending on choices, etc.).

Conclusion about C2:
- Under Interpretation B (the usual meaning in these transition problems: “event1 will always occur/recurs in every run”), C1 is true (event1 occurs in every possible trace and indeed infinitely often), therefore C2 (the negation) is false.
- Under Interpretation A (the stronger meaning “event1 holds at every time step”), C1 is false (the initial step is event2, not event1), so C2 would be true.

Most natural reading in this setting is the liveness one (Interpretation B). With that reading: C1 holds, so C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: Under the usual liveness reading (C1 = ""event1 occurs in every execution, indeed infinitely often""), every trace from the initial event2 is 2→3→1→... so event1 always occurs, hence C1 is true and C2 (its negation) is false. (If one instead meant C1 as ""event1 holds at every time step,"" that stronger meaning would make C1 false and C2 true, but that reading is atypical here.)"

Short answer: C2 is True (given the rules in the context).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → event3)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → event2)
These imply that once event2 occurs it forces event3 next, and event3 forces event2 next (a loop).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens."" (i.e., event2 ∧ event3.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally C2 = (event2 → C1) = (event2 → (event2 ∧ event3)). Note that (event2 → (event2 ∧ event3)) is logically equivalent to (event2 → event3) because event2 → event2 is trivial.

4) How they relate
- From the rules: because event1 occurred, event1 → event2 gives event2 occurs; then event2 → event3 gives event3 occurs. So C1 is true in the given scenario.
- More generally, whenever event2 occurs the rule event2 → event3 guarantees event3 will occur as well, so event2 implies (event2 ∧ event3). Thus C2 is true given the transition rules (it reduces to the existing rule event2 → event3).
- Edge note: this depends on treating the ""must happen"" rules as guaranteeing the subsequent events will indeed occur. Under that interpretation, C2 follows directly from the rules and is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition given: event3 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (interpretation)
- ""After event1, event3 must happen"" means: whenever event1 occurs, there must later be an occurrence of event3.
- ""After event3, event1 must happen"" means: whenever event3 occurs, there must later be an occurrence of event1.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means event2 is terminal: if event2 occurs, no further events may occur afterward.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens"" — true exactly when at least one of event3 or event2 occurs.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — true when event1 occurs, or when C1 is true (or both).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- We are told event3 happened initially, so ""event3 happens"" is true. Therefore C1 is true (event3 ∨ event2 holds).
- Given C1 is true, the disjunction in C2 (event1 ∨ C1) is true regardless of whether event1 occurs.
- Independently, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" also implies event1 will occur later, so event1 is true as well — giving a second reason C2 is true.

Possible consistency note (not required for the conclusion): if event2 were to occur immediately after event3, that would block further events and violate the obligation ""after event3, event1 must happen."" With the given facts (only that event3 initially happened), no contradiction is forced and C2 remains true.

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event1 → event3 must happen.
- After event2 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen (non‑deterministic choice).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this in the usual universal way: whenever an occurrence of event3 happens, event2 must occur (i.e. 3 implies  occurrence of 2 afterwards).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" This is a logical OR: C2 is true if either C1 is a true property of the system, or event3 occurs (at least once).

4) How they relate and truth values
- C1 is false. Reason: the rule 3 → (1 or 2) allows an occurrence 3 → 1, so there are valid execution traces where a given occurrence of event3 is followed by event1 and not by event2. Example trace: start with event2 (initial), then 3 (forced), then choose 1 (allowed), then 3, then 1, … — here many occurrences of event3 are not followed by event2, so ""every time 3 happens then 2 happens"" is false.
- C2 is true. Reason: even though C1 is false, the other disjunct ""event3 happens"" is true in this system: from the initial event2 we must next have event3 (2 → 3), so event3 does occur. Thus (C1 ∨ event3) evaluates to true.

(If you meant a different formal reading of C1/C2, mention it—the conclusion changes only if you reinterpret the quantification/temporal scope of ""happens"".)

- Initial condition: event3 happened (this is the starting fact).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So once event3 has happened, event1 and event2 cannot happen thereafter.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 happens, event2 must follow.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 happens, event1 must follow.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 is false / never occurs.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e. event2 ∨ C1.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- From the initial fact and the rule ""after event3 no other events can happen"", neither event1 nor event2 can occur (there is no room for further events after the initial event3).
- Therefore C1 is true (event2 does not happen).
- C2 is the disjunction (event2 happens) OR (C1). Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 happens.
- Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (we are at a state immediately after an occurrence of event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. the next state must have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. the state after that must have event2).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.

(“Must” here means necessity for the next state; assume one event occurs per state.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.”
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e. “Event2 does not happen in the next state.”)

4) How they relate and final deduction
- Since we start in a state where event2 just happened, the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” forces the next state to be event1.
- Therefore C1 (event2 in the next state) is false.
- Hence C2, the negation of C1, is true.

(If you allowed simultaneous multiple events in a state or interpreted “after” differently, the answer could change; under the usual single-event-per-state, “must” reading above, C2 is True.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: we start after event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to be event1, so C1 is false and its negation C2 is true."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.

(These are rules about which event can/ must occur immediately after a given event.)

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (read as: event3 does not happen — e.g. never happens, or at least it is false that event3 happens.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" In ordinary logic this means: if event2 occurs, then event3 does not occur.

4) How they relate and evaluation of C2
- C1 is already false because the initial condition states event3 happened.
- To show C2 is false we need a case where event2 happens (antecedent true) while C1 is false (consequent false). That is easily possible under the rules: from the initial event3, the rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" allows event2 to happen next. So there is a valid sequence: event3 (initial) -> event2. In that sequence the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is true, while the consequent ""event3 does not happen"" is false (because event3 already happened initially). Thus the implication ""if event2 then event3 does not happen"" is false.

Therefore C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is already false because event3 happened initially. After that initial event3, a valid next step is event2 (rule: after event3 either event1 or event2). So there is a permitted run where event2 occurs while C1 is false. That gives antecedent true and consequent false for ""if event2 happens then C1"", so the implication C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions

- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true/has occurred at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally, C2 is (C1 → event1). Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to asserting event1 happens.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start in a state where event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (i.e. event2 → (event1 ∨ event3) for the next step).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, event2 must happen (event3 → event2 for the next step).

Possible sequences starting from the initial event2:
- event2 → event1 (then stop), or
- event2 → event3 → event2 → … (possibly repeating the event3↔event2 cycle), with the option on any return to event2 to instead go to event1 and stop.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" Formally C1 is (event3 → event3). This is a logical tautology (any proposition implies itself).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally C2 is (event2 → C1), i.e. event2 → (event3 → event3).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Since C1 is a tautology (event3 → event3 is always true regardless of whether event3 actually occurs), the consequent of C2 is always true.
- An implication with a true consequent is always true. Therefore C2 (event2 → (event3 → event3)) is true in every case.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Note: If you instead meant a temporal reading like ""if event3 happens then event3 will happen again (at some later time),"" that is a different (non‑tautological) statement and would require re-evaluating the transitions; under that reading C1 would not be guaranteed, and C2 might then be false.

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the run starts at event2).

2) Transition rules (what must happen after an event)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (3 -> 2)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (2 -> {1,3})
- After event1, event2 must happen. (1 -> 2)

So the directed transition graph is:
2 -> 1
2 -> 3
1 -> 2
3 -> 2
and the run starts at node 2.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There is some future step in the run where event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Interpreting “event2 happens” as “event2 occurs at some (possibly the next) time” after that, i.e. there is at least one occurrence of event2 in the run (and in particular after a 1).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- If some run satisfies C1, then at some time t event1 occurs. By the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” the very next step (or at least subsequently) event2 occurs. Therefore in any run where C1 is true, event2 does indeed happen (after that occurrence of event1). So the implication C1 => event2 is valid.
- Note: C1 itself is not guaranteed by the rules (there are runs that never visit event1, e.g. 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> …). But that does not affect the truth of the implication: whenever C1 holds, the rules force an occurrence of event2.

Short answer: C2 is False (under the usual “next-state” semantics). Explanation step by step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- You are given three rules: “after event1, no other events can happen,” “after event2, no other events can happen,” and “after event3, no other events can happen.” Each of these makes any state reached immediately after that event terminal (no successor states with further events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Interpreted naturally as “event2 never occurs (in any future state).”
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That means: in the immediate successor state (the state one step after the current/initial state), it is true that event2 does not happen.

4) How do these conditions relate and how to evaluate C2?
- Because event1 already happened initially and “after event1 no other events can happen,” the state reached after event1 is terminal: there is no successor (no “next state”).
- C1 is true in the current/overall system (event2 never happens) because no further events can occur after the initial event1.
- C2 asserts a property about the immediate successor state. Under the standard semantics for the temporal operator “next” (X), Xϕ is false if there is no next state. Therefore C2 is false: there is no next state in which to evaluate C1, so “C1 holds in the next state” does not hold.

Note on alternative readings: If you adopt a nonstandard semantics where “next” is treated vacuously true when no successor exists, or if “in the next state” is read as “in all future states” (i.e., a global/always claim), then one might instead conclude C2 true. But under the usual interpretation used in temporal logic, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state is terminal because event1 already happened and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" so there is no immediate successor state. Under standard next-state semantics, ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1) is false when no next state exists."

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next (choice is non‑deterministic).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" This phrase is ambiguous; two natural readings:
  - Strong reading (S): event3 holds at every step (i.e., every moment the current event is event3).
  - Liveness reading (L): event3 occurs repeatedly / infinitely often (i.e., from any point you will see event3 again eventually).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., the negation of whichever reading of C1 we adopt.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Under the strong reading (S): C1 is false. After an occurrence of event3 the next step might be event1 (or event2), so there are steps where event3 is not happening. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is true.
- Under the liveness reading (L): C1 is true. From event3 you either go directly to event2 (then to event3), or to event1 then to event2 then to event3. Either way you return to event3 in 1 or 2 steps, and this pattern repeats forever, so event3 occurs infinitely often. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer (concise)
- If ""always happens"" means ""at every step"" → C2 is True.
- If ""always happens"" means ""happens repeatedly / infinitely often"" → C2 is False.

If you tell me which meaning of ""always"" you intend, I’ll give the single definite truth value.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: from event3 you can transition to event1 (or event2), so there are steps where event3 does not hold; hence the reading of ""always"" as ""at every step"" makes C1 false and thus C2 true. (If ""always"" meant ""infinitely often,"" the answer would be False.)"

- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so if event1 occurs, then at a later point event2 ∨ event3 occurs).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event2 → eventually event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal). (The last rule is repeated but gives no extra information.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally C1 is (event1 → event1). This is a logical tautology (always true): any proposition implies itself.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Formally C2 is (event2 ∨ C1).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C2
- C1 is always true (tautology), regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.
- Therefore C2 = event2 ∨ C1 is true, because the disjunct C1 is true.
- Independently, the initial condition also makes the ""event2 happens"" disjunct true, so C2 is true on that account as well.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is a tautology (event1 → event1) so C2 = event2 ∨ C1 is true (and independently event2 is initially true)."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e. at the initial moment event2 is true).

2) What are the transition/temporal rules?
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur (so any occurrence of event3 forces a later occurrence of event1).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can occur (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can occur (event2 is terminal).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (there exists a future point where event1 occurs)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (if event1 ever happens, then event2 happens at some point)

4) How do these conditions relate; truth-values?
- Because event2 has happened initially and rule “after event2 no other events can happen” holds, no further events can occur after the initial moment. In particular, event1 cannot occur later, so C1 is false (event1 does not eventually happen).
- C2 is the implication (C1 → event2 happens). An implication is true whenever the antecedent is false, and in this case the consequent (event2 happens) is also true anyway (event2 happened initially). So C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 occurs, the run ends — event2 and event3 cannot occur afterward).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 ⇒ event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 ends the run).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ event1 ∨ event2.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" ≡ event1 ∧ (event1 ∨ event2).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition, event1 is true. Because event1 is true, event2 cannot occur (by the rule after event1 no other events happen), but that does not affect the truth of the disjunction.
- C1 = event1 ∨ event2 is true (since event1 is true).
- C2 = event1 ∧ C1 = event1 ∧ (event1 ∨ event2). This simplifies logically to event1 (because A ∧ (A ∨ B) ≡ A). Since event1 is true, C2 is true.

Step 0 — assumptions about ""eventually""
- I assume ""eventually"" (the usual temporal/F operator) includes the current time point (i.e. ""at some time now or in the future""). I will note a strict-future variant at the end.

1) What events are involved and the initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial time).
- Also: once event2 has happened, no further events can occur (the system halts after event2).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: event2 must happen.
- After event2: no other events can happen. (This was stated twice; same meaning.)

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Under the usual semantics, this means there exists some time now or in the future at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That is, at some time now or in the future the statement C1 will be true. Equivalently this is ""eventually (eventually event2)"".

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 has already happened at the initial time, C1 is already true.
- Since C1 already holds now, ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true (if something is true now, it certainly holds at some time now-or-later).
- Also note the temporal identity: eventually(eventually p) is equivalent to eventually p, so C2 is equivalent to C1 here.

Conclusion: C2 is True (given the usual ""eventually"" semantics that include the current time).

Edge case (strict-future semantics): If you interpret ""eventually"" to mean ""at some strictly later time"" (not including the present), then:
- C1 would be false (no later event2 can occur because event2 already happened and it halts further events).
- Consequently C2 would also be false.
So the answer depends on that semantic choice; under the common inclusive semantics, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 has already happened, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true now; therefore ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true. (Under a strict-future reading of ""eventually"" both would be false.)"

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. event1 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event3 happens, then event1 must happen afterward. (event3 → event1)
- Rule B: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward. (event1 → event2)
- Rule C: If event2 happens, then no other events can happen after that. (event2 is terminal)

From the initial condition and rules we can infer a possible timeline: event1 occurs initially → by Rule B event2 must occur later → after event2 no further events occur (so event3 cannot occur after event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens."" Formally: event1 ∨ event3.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Formally: event1 ∨ C1, which expands to event1 ∨ (event1 ∨ event3).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Logical simplification: event1 ∨ (event1 ∨ event3) is equivalent to event1 ∨ event3 (C1). So C2 is logically equivalent to C1 (they express the same disjunction).
- Since the initial condition states event1 happened, event1 is true. Therefore both C1 (event1 ∨ event3) and C2 (event1 ∨ C1) are true.

Conclusion: C2 is True (and in fact C2 is equivalent to C1; both are satisfied because event1 happened).

Step‑by‑step:

- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (the system starts in a state where event3 occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3 occurs, no further events can occur (event3 is terminal).
- If event1 occurs, then event3 must occur afterwards (event1 ⇒ eventually event3).
- If event2 occurs, then event3 must occur afterwards (event2 ⇒ eventually event3).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens.” (There exists some time at or after now when event3 occurs.)
- C2: “C1 holds and event3 happens.” (The conjunction of C1 with the fact that event3 happens.) Note: C2 is redundant — if “event3 happens” is true then “event3 eventually happens” (C1) is automatically true, so C2 reduces to “event3 happens.”

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C2 ⇒ C1 (because C2 includes C1).
- C1 does not necessarily imply C2 unless you also know that event3 actually occurs now/at some point (but in most readings “event3 happens” is the same as “event3 eventually happens,” so they coincide).
- Given the rules, nothing prevents C1 from holding when event3 has already happened; the rules about event1/event2 forcing event3 are irrelevant once event3 already occurred.

- Since event3 happened initially, C1 is true, and “event3 happens” is true, so their conjunction C2 is true.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0), event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen (i.e., in the next state after an event1 state, event3 occurs).
- After event3, event1 must happen (i.e., next state after an event3 state has event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (i.e., a state in which event2 happens is terminal — the next state has no events).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Interpreting relative to the current state s0, C1 asserts that s1 (the immediate successor of s0) has event2.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreted as an implication about the current state: if event2 happens now (in s0), then event2 happens in the next state (i.e., C1 is true).

4) How they relate and truth value
- From the rules: s0 has event2, and because ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" s1 has no events — in particular s1 does not have event2. So C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- C2 is the implication (event2 now) → (event2 next). In s0 the antecedent is true (event2 happened) while the consequent is false (C1 is false), so the implication is false. Therefore C2 is false.

(If one changed the temporal reading — e.g., considered a different state where event2 never occurs — the implication could be vacuously true in that state, but given the initial state s0 with event2, C2 fails because of the counterexample described.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: In the initial state event2 holds, but after event2 no events occur, so event2 does not hold in the next state. The implication (event2 now → event2 next) is then true→false, which is false."

Short answer: C2 is True (C1 is False).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (stated twice; same rule)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible execution/run, event3 occurs at some point (i.e. event3 is inevitable / must occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Equivalent to ¬C1: it is not the case that event3 always happens (i.e. there exists a possible execution where event3 never happens).

4) How the conditions relate and final reasoning
- From the rules and the initial event1, the rules force event2 next, then event1, then event2, and so on: an execution e1, e2, e1, e2, ... is valid and satisfies all rules.
- Nothing in the rules forces event3 to ever occur. The rule about event3 only constrains what must follow if event3 happens; it does not require event3 to happen.
- Therefore there exists a valid execution (the alternating e1/e2 sequence) in which event3 never occurs. That shows C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false.
- Hence C2 (the negation of C1) is true.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event3 occurs, event1 must happen (so any trace containing event3 is followed later by event1).
- After event1 occurs, event3 must happen.
- After event2 occurs, either event1 or event3 must happen.
(""must"" means these are required transitions in every allowed execution.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens"" (i.e. e1 ∨ e3 holds at a point in time).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — formally: at some future point (possibly next step) e1 ∨ e3 is true.

4) How they relate (proof that C2 is true)
- From the initial condition, event2 has happened.
- The rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" forces that at the next step (or eventually immediately after) at least one of event1 or event3 occurs.
- Therefore C1 holds at that next step, so ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied.
- Moreover, once either event1 or event3 occurs, the other is required to occur next by the mutual rules, producing an alternating sequence (e1 → e3 → e1 → …). So not only does C1 eventually hold, it will hold infinitely often.

Note on interpretation: This conclusion assumes ""must"" denotes a required transition in every allowed execution. If instead ""must"" were read as merely ""may,"" the conclusion would not follow. Under the usual reading given, C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: From the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"", at the next step at least one of event1 or event3 occurs, so C1 holds then. Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true. (Given the other rules, whichever of e1 or e3 occurs forces the other next, producing an alternating sequence, so C1 holds infinitely often.)"

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (the system starts in a state where event3 holds).

2) Transition rules
- After event1: no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: event2 must happen next.

So possible traces from the initial state: event3 → event2 → event1 (then stop), or event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → … (a loop between 3 and 2), etc.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the propositional implication event2 → event2 (a self-implication).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. in every state/time point reachable in the system, the formula C1 is true (a global or invariant claim).

4) How they relate and why C2 is True
- The formula p → p is a tautology: it is true whenever p is true (then the consequent equals the antecedent, so true) and also true whenever p is false (implication with false antecedent is true). So C1 is true in every possible state.
- Check the reachable states from the initial condition: event3, event2, event1 (and repeats). In each of these states the implication event2 → event2 is true (either because event2 is false there, or because it is true and implies itself).
- Therefore C1 holds in every reachable state, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Note: this conclusion assumes the usual reading that ""If event2 happens then event2 happens"" is a same-state propositional implication (p → p). If instead the antecedent and consequent refer to different times (e.g. ""if event2 ever happens, then it will (again) happen in the future""), the meaning and truth could change; under the natural reading given, C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (interpretation: ""after X must happen"" = X is followed eventually by the other event):
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction; it simplifies to ""Event3 happens"" (i.e. there exists a time at which event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This means that at some time (possibly now) C1 is true — equivalently, event3 occurs at some point in time.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event3 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the start.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true (it holds immediately).
- Moreover, given the rules after event3 → event1 and after event1 → event3, the system forces an alternation of event3 and event1; so event3 will occur repeatedly in the future as well. Event2 is irrelevant here unless it occurs, in which case it only enforces more event3 occurrences.
- Caveat: this conclusion assumes ""must happen"" guarantees eventual occurrence (a liveness guarantee). If instead ""must happen"" were only a constraint that could be violated, you could not conclude liveness. Given your wording (""must happen""), C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (start in the “event3” state).

2) Transition rules (state graph)
- From event3: next is either event1 or event2. (e3 → e1 or e3 → e2)
- From event1: next is either event2 or event3. (e1 → e2 or e1 → e3)
- From event2: next is event1 (must). (e2 → e1)

(One of the rules was repeated; it is the same constraint e2 → e1.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Interpreted as: along a run starting from the initial state, there will be some future step at which event1 occurs.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreted as: from every reachable state (i.e., on every possible continuation), C1 is true — equivalently, on every possible run starting from the initial state, event1 will occur at some future time. (In other words: for every state, event1 is guaranteed to happen eventually.)

4) How they relate / proof
- From e1: event1 has already happened (so “event1 eventually happens” holds immediately).
- From e2: rule forces the next state to be e1, so event1 will happen in one step.
- From e3: either you immediately go to e1, or you go to e2 and then must go to e1. So from e3 event1 occurs within at most two steps.

Thus from every reachable state (e1, e2, e3) event1 is guaranteed to occur within 0–2 transitions. Therefore C1 is true for the initial state, and C2 (that C1 always holds) is also true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: from e3 you go to e1 or e2; from e2 you must go to e1; and from e1 event1 has already occurred. Thus on every possible run (and from every reachable state) event1 occurs within at most two steps, so C1 holds on all runs — C2 is True."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so event2 does occur at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 ⇒ event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 ⇒ event3)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (event1 ⇒ event3)

From the first two rules we get a forced cycle: event2 ⇒ event3 ⇒ event2, so once event2 occurs (and it does initially) both event2 and event3 will keep occurring according to the rules. event1 is not said to occur.

Step 3 — meanings of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” (i.e., ¬event2).
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens” (i.e., ¬event2 ∨ event2).

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- C2 is a logical tautology: (¬A ∨ A) is always true for any proposition A. So C2 is true regardless of whether event2 happens.
- Concretely here, since event2 does happen initially, C1 is false and C2 is true (because the disjunction includes event2).

Final answer: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (i.e., the initial state / moment includes event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 happens then the next/ eventual event is event3).
Given the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"", the system immediately reaches a terminal state with only event1 and no further events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology in the usual reading: the antecedent and consequent are identical, so C1 is true in any state where the formula is evaluated. It is true right now (since event1 did happen) and in general is trivially true wherever evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This says there exists some point in the future (possibly the current point) at which the property C1 is true.

(There was no C3 in the hypothesis; if you meant another condition, say which one and I’ll interpret it.)

4) How these conditions relate and final verdict
- Because C1 is already true in the initial state (and in fact is a tautology), there is a point — the current/initial point — at which C1 holds. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied.
- So C2 is True.

Note on possible ambiguity: If ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" were intended to mean something different (for example, ""if event1 happens now then event1 happens next""), the answer could change; with the straightforward reading above, C2 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is the tautology (event1 → event1), so it holds in the initial state (and every state). Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied."

- Logically, for any propositions P and Q, P → (P ∨ Q) is always true: if P is true, then the disjunction P ∨ Q is certainly true. Here P = event1 and Q = event3, so event1 → (event1 ∨ event3) is a tautology.
- Moreover, because event3 already happened, C1 is true regardless, so the implication in C2 is also satisfied in every possible run.

Therefore C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C2 is the formula event1 → (event3 ∨ event1). For any proposition P and Q, P → (P ∨ Q) is always true (if P holds then P ∨ Q certainly holds). Also here event3 has already happened, so C1 is true outright, making the implication hold as well."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we start in a state after event1).

2) Transition rules (as given)
- After event2 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → event3 must happen.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen (at least one of those).

3) What the hypotheses mean
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Natural reading here is that event3 occurs repeatedly / infinitely often (it is not required that every single step is event3, only that event3 keeps occurring according to the rules).  
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Read as: under the assumption that event3 always occurs, event2 must occur at some point (i.e. event2 is forced).

4) How the conditions relate; counterexample showing C2 is false
- From the rules we can construct this infinite trace:
  event1 (initial) → event3 (required after event1) → event1 (choose this branch after event3) → event3 → event1 → event3 → ...
- This trace respects all rules: after every event1 comes event3, and after every event3 we chose event1 (which is allowed). Event3 occurs infinitely often (so C1 holds), but event2 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 can be true while event2 never happens, so the implication ""C1 ⇒ event2"" is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (there is a valid execution satisfying C1 that never produces event2).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: start with event1 (initial) → event3 (required after event1) → event1 (choose this branch after event3) → event3 → event1 → ... This trace satisfies all rules, has event3 occurring infinitely often (C1 holds), and never produces event2. Hence C2 is false."

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

- After event3, event2 must happen (E3 → E2 at some later time).
Given E3 initially, E2 must follow and then no further events can occur. Event1 cannot occur after that.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" — logically C1 = ¬E3.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" — logically C2 = (¬E3) ∨ E3.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- (¬E3) ∨ E3 is a classical logical tautology (it is true for both E3 = true and E3 = false).
- Concretely here E3 is true (given), so C1 = false and C2 = true.
- Therefore C2 is True (in fact C2 is always true regardless of whether E3 occurs).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened (so the initial state satisfies event3).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen: any state in which event2 occurs has a next state where event3 occurs.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen: any state with event3 has a next state where event1 or event2 occurs (at least one of those occurs next).
- After event1, no other events can happen: a state with event1 has no further events afterward (no next-event states, or equivalently all subsequent states have no events).

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally this is (event1 → event1). This is a propositional tautology (always true in any single state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Symbolically Next(C1). It asserts that in the immediate successor state, the formula C1 is true.

(There is no C3 given in the problem statement.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth-value of C2
- C1 is a tautology: for any state, whether event1 holds or not, (event1 → event1) is true.
- Therefore C1 is true in every reachable state, including any immediate successor states that exist.
- From the transition rules, the initial state (where event3 holds) does have at least one successor (event1 or event2 must follow), so the ""next state"" exists.
- Since C1 is true in every state, it is true in the next state(s). Hence Next(C1) (C2) is true in the initial state.

Minor semantic note: if your semantics treat Next(·) as automatically false when no successor exists (e.g., a state with no next state), then C2 could be false when evaluated at such a terminal state. But in the given scenario the initial state is not terminal (from event3 there is a required next event), and C1 is a tautology, so C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 (event1 → event1) is a propositional tautology, so it holds in every state. From event3 the model requires at least one successor state, and C1 holds in that successor, so Next(C1) (C2) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (constraints)
- After event2: no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen (i.e., following any occurrence of event1, at least one of event2 or event3 occurs later).
- After event3: event1 must happen (every event3 is followed by an event1).

Step 3 — what the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens."" Interpreted as the logical disjunction: (∃ occurrence of event3) OR (∃ occurrence of event1).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Equivalent to (∃ occurrence of event1) AND ((∃ event3) OR (∃ event1)).

(Clarification about ""happens"": the answer depends on whether you mean “happens at some time in the timeline (past or future)” — i.e., “ever happens” — or you mean “happens again in the future after now”.)

Step 4 — relate them and evaluate C2

- Under the usual reading “happens” = “occurs at some time (ever)”: event1 has already occurred (given). So the disjunction in C1 is true (because event1 occurred). Thus C1 is true, and event1 is true, so C2 = event1 AND C1 is true. Conclusion: C2 is True.

- Under the stricter reading “happens” = “will happen in the future (after the initial moment)”: after the initial event1 there are two possible continuations:
  - event1 → event2 (then nothing else): neither event3 nor another event1 occurs later, so C1 is false and C2 is false.
  - event1 → event3 → event1 → ... (repeating): then both event3 and event1 do occur later, so C1 and C2 are true.
  So in this future-only interpretation, C2 is not guaranteed — it can be true or false depending on which allowed branch happens (false if the immediate next event is event2).

Final answer (most natural reading)
- Interpreting “happens” as “has happened or will happen (ever)”, C2 is True.  
- If you meant “happens again in the future,” the truth of C2 depends on which allowed continuation (event2 vs. event3) occurs; it can be false.

True

- Events: event1, event2, event3.

2) Transition rules

- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Interpreting “happens” as “occurs at some point in the run,” C1 is simply the disjunction (event3 ∨ event2).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → (event3 ∨ event2).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the initial condition and rules: event1 → event3, so event3 does occur after the initial event1; therefore C1 is true in this scenario (event3 happens).
- More generally, C2 is a logical tautology: P → (P ∨ Q) is always true. If event2 happens, then the disjunction (event2 ∨ event3) is automatically true because event2 holds. So C2 is true regardless of the other rules.

Note on ambiguity: If you meant a different temporal reading (e.g., “at the next step after event2”), the conclusion still holds under the usual readings: either way C2 is true because the consequent of C2 contains event2 itself.

- (Even if you follow future transitions, from event2 you either go to event1 directly or to event3 and then to event1; in all cases you encounter event1 or event2, so C1 holds now and will hold again.)

- (No C3 was provided; if there were, it would be another proposition to evaluate similarly.)

4) How these relate and final evaluation
- From the rules, C1 is true (because the rule says event3 must be followed by event2).
- Also, event3 actually happened initially, so the second disjunct (event3) is also true.
- Therefore C2 = (C1) ∨ (event3) is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules (as given)
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
So once event2 has occurred, there is an obligation that event1 occurs next, then event3, then event1, and so on (an alternating 1↔3 cycle after the forced event1).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” (This is a statement about a particular state: that event3 is not true in that state.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” In other words: in the state immediately following the initial state, event3 does not happen.

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” and given event2 happened in the initial state, the next state must have event1.
- Under the usual assumptions that events are exclusive (only one event occurs in a state) and “after” means the immediate next state, the next state must be event1 — so event3 does not happen there. Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Caveats / alternative readings
- If events can occur concurrently (event1 and event3 could both hold in the same state), then event3 might also occur in the next state and C2 would be false/undetermined.
- If “after” was intended as “eventually after” rather than “in the immediate next state,” then whether event3 is absent in the very next state is not guaranteed.

Final answer: Under the standard reading (immediate next-state obligation and mutually exclusive events), C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: From the initial state event2 occurred, so by the immediate ""after event2"" rule the next state must be event1. Assuming events are exclusive, event3 does not occur in that next state, so C2 holds."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so event1 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules (written as implications)
- After event3, event2 must happen: e3 → e2.
- After event2, event1 must happen: e2 → e1.
- After event1, event3 must happen: e1 → e3.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens"" — logically e2 → e3.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" — logically e3 ∨ (e2 → e3).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial fact e1 and the rule e1 → e3 we get e3.
- From e3 and e3 → e2 we get e2.
- From e2 and e2 → e1 we get e1 again (consistency).
- C1 holds because e2 → e1 and e1 → e3 together give e2 → e3 (transitivity of implication).
- C2 is true because e3 is true (so the disjunction e3 ∨ (e2 → e3) is true).

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (so every execution starts with event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event3 must happen (i.e. event3 will occur following event2).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (This is a statement about the execution: event1 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (This says that in all possible executions consistent with the rules, event1 never occurs — a universal/invariant claim.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the conclusion?
- Execution must start with event2.
- From event2, event3 must occur. Once event3 occurs no further events can occur.
- If event1 ever occurred after event2, it would prevent event3 from occurring (because event1 is terminal), which would violate the rule that event3 must happen after event2. So event1 cannot occur after event2.
- There is no possibility for event1 to have occurred before the initial event2 (the initial fact fixes the start as event2).
- Therefore event1 cannot occur in any allowed execution. C1 is true for every execution, so C2 (the claim that C1 always holds) is true.

(If one allowed simultaneous or nonstandard interleavings, the same reasoning applies: any occurrence of event1 that would block the mandated event3 is disallowed by the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen,"" so the conclusion still holds.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: every execution starts with event2, and the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 next. Both event1 and event3 are terminal, so event1 cannot occur after event2, and it cannot have occurred before the initial event2. Therefore event1 never occurs in any allowed execution, so C1 holds in all executions and C2 is True."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened (so we start in a state labeled event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2: event1 must happen next (only possible successor is event1).
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3: no further events (event3 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreting this in the standard trace/transition sense: on any run, whenever event3 occurs it must be the case that event1 has occurred (immediately before, or at least sometime earlier on that run). In other words, event3 never occurs without a preceding event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C1 is true when evaluated from the state immediately following the initial state. (Given the initial event2, the next state is the state where event1 has just happened.)

4) How they relate / final check
- From the transition rules, event3 can only occur as the direct successor of event1. Therefore any occurrence of event3 is necessarily preceded by event1. So C1 is true in every reachable state (it is an invariant of the transition rules).
- In particular, in the next state (the event1 state) C1 is still true. Therefore C2 is True.

True"

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 happens, it is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 happens, it is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (if event3 happens, it is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the natural sense: in the described system/run, event1 occurs (or occurs in every possible run). Either way it asserts that event1 does occur.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This asserts that event1 does not always happen (i.e., C1 is false).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- The initial state already has event3 having happened.
- Because ""after event3, no other events can happen,"" once event3 has happened there can be no further events, so event1 cannot occur at any later time in this run.
- Therefore event1 does not happen in the given scenario; C1 is false.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

So C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, event2 must happen next.
These rules force a repeating sequence between event2 and event3 (event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → …). There is no rule that produces event1 from the given rules or initial state.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e., at a given time C1 is true iff event1 ∨ event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time now or in the future there is a state where C1 is true).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- At the initial time event2 has happened, so C1 is already true at that time.
- Even if one required a strict future (not counting the current moment), the transition rules ensure event2 recurs (t0: event2, t1: event3, t2: event2, …), so C1 will be true again later.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (so the system/run starts with event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So once event2 has occurred, the next required event is event1.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (If event3 occurs, it must be followed by event1 or event2.)

(Implicit assumption used below: these rules describe the allowed/forced sequence of events starting from the initial condition; ""must happen"" = inevitably follows.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreted as: in the run(s) allowed by the rules from the initial condition, event3 occurs in every run / necessarily occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is, it is not the case that event3 always happens (equivalently: event3 is not guaranteed / there is at least one allowed run where event3 does not occur).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Start from the initial condition: event2 happened.
- From the rule after event2, event1 must happen next.
- After event1, no further events can happen, so the run ends immediately after event1.
- Thus, in this (the actual) run starting from the initial condition, event3 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false (because we have an allowed run in which event3 never happens).
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

- From the rules: event3 occurs initially, and that implies event1 must occur afterwards. Once event1 occurs, no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).
- Therefore, if event3 happened, event1 must happen and nothing can happen after event1 — so event2 cannot happen after event3.
- Given the initial fact that event3 happened first, there is no point in the allowed execution where event2 can also occur. Thus C1 (both event3 and event2 happen) cannot be satisfied.
- Therefore C2 (C1 does not hold) is True.

Note: This conclusion assumes a usual sequential interpretation (events occur in sequence, not simultaneously). If simultaneous/co-occurring events were allowed and event2 could occur at the same instant as event3, the answer could be different; under the standard sequential reading, C2 is True.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- Logically, C2 is an instance of the tautology p ⇒ (p ∨ q). That implication is always true for any propositions p and q.
- In the given scenario, the antecedent of C2 (event1 happened) is true, and the consequent C1 is also true (because event1 happened makes the disjunction true, and in fact event3 will also happen). So the implication is true here as well.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (i.e., at the start).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""after X"" as ""at any time after X happens"")
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, neither event2 nor event3 can occur later.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (i.e., if event3 occurs, then later event1 or event2 must occur).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" (logical disjunction: event3 ∨ C1).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because event1 happened initially and the rule says no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time. Therefore C1 is True.
- C2 is ""event3 or C1"". A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; since C1 is True, C2 is True regardless of whether event3 happens.
- (Note: by the same reasoning event3 also cannot happen after the initial event1, so in fact event3 does not happen either; but that is unnecessary to conclude C2.)

Conclusion: C1 = True, therefore C2 = True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, so event2 does not happen (C1 is True). Therefore the disjunction ""event3 or C1"" (C2) is True regardless of event3."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — what the claims mean
- C1: “Event3 does not happen.” (i.e., event3 never happens / event3 did not occur)
- C2: “C1 does not hold” = not(C1) = “Event3 does happen.”

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- The initial condition states event3 happened. That makes C1 false.
- Therefore C2 = not(C1) is true.

So C2 is True. (The other transition rules are consistent with this: since event3 already happened and is terminal, no further events can occur.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (i.e. event1 ⇒ (event2 or event3)).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 ⇒ event1).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (A claim about the next step after the initial state.)
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event3 happens.” (The implication C1 ⇒ event3.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C2 true or false?
- Because the initial event was event3 and event3 is terminal, no further events can occur. So C1 is false in this run (event1 does not happen in the next state).
- From the transition rules alone, event1 does not guarantee event3: after event1 you could get event2 instead, so the rule set does not entail the implication (event1 ⇒ event3). In other words, C2 is not a logical consequence of the transition rules.
- However, evaluating the statement C2 in the actual (given) run: C1 is false, so the implication C1 ⇒ event3 is true vacuously. Thus:
  - As a property of the rules (does the system force event3 whenever event1 occurs?): No — C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.
  - As a truth value in the current execution (given initial event3): C2 is true (vacuously), because C1 is false.

Short answer: C2 is not entailed by the transition rules, but it is true in the given initial run (vacuously, because C1 is false).

Answer up front: C2 is not determined by the rules — it can be true in some allowed executions and false in others. Below are the step-by-step answers.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the execution starts with event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event1 → event3).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event2 → event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so event3 → (event1 or event2)).
Thus the allowed immediate-next-event patterns are:
  - event1 → event3 → event1 → ...
  - event1 → event3 → event2 → event3 → (event1 or event2) → ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event3 happens and event2 happens.” (There exists an execution in which both event3 and event2 occur at some points.)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” (Negation: in the execution in question, it is not the case that both event3 and event2 occur — i.e., either event3 does not happen, or event2 does not happen, or both do not happen.)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the initial condition and rules we can deduce that event3 will happen (because event1 → event3). So event3 is guaranteed.
- Whether event2 ever happens is not forced by the rules: after each event3 there is a choice between event1 and event2. It is possible to always choose event1, producing the infinite cycle event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... in which event2 never occurs.
- It is also possible at some occurrence of event3 to choose event2, producing a trace like event1 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... in which event2 does occur.

Therefore:
- There exist allowed executions where C1 is false (e.g., 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... ; here event2 never happens), so C2 is true in those executions.
- There also exist allowed executions where C1 is true (e.g., 1 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... ; here both event3 and event2 occur), so C2 is false in those executions.

Conclusion: C2 is neither universally true nor universally false given the rules — it is contingent. If you mean “Is C2 logically entailed by the premises?” the answer is No. If you mean “Is C2 satisfiable?” the answer is Yes (there are executions where it holds).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Explanation: event3 is forced (event1 → event3), but event2 is optional after each event3. There are allowed executions where event2 never occurs (so C2 holds) and others where event2 does occur (so C2 is false). Thus C2 is not entailed by the rules (it is satisfiable but not universally true)."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start in a state right after event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1: no further events can occur (terminal).
- After event2: the next event must be either event1 or event3 (one of those must happen).
- After event3: the next event must be event2.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (i.e., from the current state, the immediate next event is event3.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future point there is a state from which the next event is event3.)

Step 4 — how they relate and answer
- From the initial state (just after event2) the next event is nondeterministically either event1 or event3.
  - If the next event is event3, then C1 is true now, so C2 is true (it holds immediately).
  - If the next event is event1, then no further events occur (terminal), so C1 is false now and will never become true; hence C2 is false in that run.
- Because there exists a run (event2 → event1) where C2 never holds, C2 is not guaranteed true in all runs.

Conclusion
- C2 is not universally true (False as a guaranteed property).  
- (Note: C2 is satisfiable — there are runs where it is true — but it is not valid in every possible execution.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 (E1), event2 (E2), event3 (E3).
- Initial condition: E1 happens at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After E1, E3 must happen (E1 → E3).
- After E3, either E1 or E2 must happen (E3 → E1 or E3 → E2).
- After E2, no other events can happen (E2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1 is written as “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” That is just a redundant disjunction; C1 ⇔ “E2 happens.”
- C2 is “C1 holds or event2 happens.” Substituting C1, C2 ⇔ “E2 happens or E2 happens,” so C2 ⇔ “E2 happens.” So both C1 and C2 express the single proposition “E2 happens.”

(Important note on “happens”: we must decide whether this means “happens in some possible execution (exists)” or “happens in every possible execution (for all).”)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth of C2
- There are executions where E2 happens: E1 → E3 → E2. In such an execution C2 is true.
- There are also executions where E2 never happens: E1 → E3 → E1 → E3 → E1 → … (always choose E1 after E3). In such an execution C2 is false.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed (not true in all possible executions). It is satisfiable (true in some executions) but not valid (not true in every execution). So you cannot declare C2 universally True; its truth is contingent on the choices made after E3.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition (time 0): event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event3 happens at time t, then event1 must happen at time t+1.
- If event1 happens at time t, then event3 must happen at time t+1.
- If event2 happens at time t, then event1 must happen at time t+1.

(Assumption: “next state” means the immediately following time step; and we take the minimal model where events occur when required by the rules.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state.” Interpreted relative to the initial state (i.e., does event3 occur at time 1?).
- C2: “Event3 happens and C1 holds.” (a conjunction: event3 happens [presumably at time 0 or 1 depending on reading] and C1 is true).

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
Construct the timeline from the initial condition:
- Time 0: event2 (given).
- By the rule after event2 → event1, at time 1: event1.
- By the rule after event1 → event3, at time 2: event3.
- By the rule after event3 → event1, at time 3: event1, and so on (it oscillates event1 ↔ event3).

Therefore:
- At time 1 (the “next state” after the initial), event1 occurs, not event3. So C1 is false.
- C2 is a conjunction that requires C1 to be true; since C1 is false, C2 is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If you instead allow unconstrained extra events to occur at a step besides the required ones, then C1 might be true in some models where event3 is also made true at time 1. But under the usual minimal/entailed interpretation above, C1 and thus C2 are false.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event3 holds.

Step 2 — transition rules (interpreting ""After A, B must happen"" as a mandatory next-state constraint)
- If event3 holds in a state, then in the next state event1 must hold. (e3 -> next e1)
- If event1 holds in a state, then in the next state event3 must hold. (e1 -> next e3)
- If event2 holds in a state, then in the next state event3 must hold. (e2 -> next e3)

So the enabled transitions are:
- e3 -> e1
- e1 -> e3
- e2 -> e3

There is no rule that allows a transition into a state where event2 holds (no * -> e2).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Formally: X event2 (the immediate next state satisfies event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Formally: F (X event2) — there exists some future state from which the immediate next state has event2. Equivalently, event2 occurs at some time strictly after the current one.

(There is no C3 given.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- Start from s0 where event3 holds. By the rule e3 -> next e1, the next state s1 must have event1.
- From s1, by e1 -> next e3, s2 must have event3.
- From s2, by e3 -> next e1, s3 must have event1, and so on.

Thus the system is forced to alternate e3, e1, e3, e1, ... forever. Because no rule allows a transition into an event2 state, event2 never occurs on this trace. Therefore:
- C1 is false at s0 (the next state is e1, not e2).
- C2 (""eventually C1 holds"", i.e. event2 occurs at some later point) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False (under the natural reading that the ""must"" rules are hard next-state constraints). If instead the rules were permissive (""may happen"") rather than mandatory, the answer could change — but with the given ""must"" semantics, C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Starting from s0 (event3), transitions force the trace e3, e1, e3, e1, ... forever and there is no rule producing a state with event2, so ""X event2"" never holds at any future state and therefore F(X event2) is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happens (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (an implication that whenever event1 occurs, event2 also occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., the implication in C1 is true in the system — for every occurrence of event1.)

4) How they relate and the verdict
- Because the initial state has event1 and the rules say that after event1 no other events can happen, there is an occurrence of event1 that is not followed by event2. That single occurrence violates C1.
- Therefore C1 is false in this system, and the claim that C1 always holds (C2) is also false.

So C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 happens initially and is terminal (no further events can occur), so there is an occurrence of event1 without event2. That makes the implication C1 false in the system, so C1 does not always hold (C2 is false)."

- Initial condition: event3 happened (i.e., at the start of the timeline/event sequence).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

(Each of the three events is terminal: once one occurs, the system produces no further events.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There exists a later time at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (Equivalently: event1 happens, or event2 eventually happens.)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- Because event3 happened initially and the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" holds, no events after event3 can ever occur. In particular, event1 cannot happen and event2 cannot happen at any later time.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happens (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur next.
- After event1 occurs, either event2 or event3 must occur next.
- After event2 occurs, event3 must occur next.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (i.e., event3 never occurs at the current time/state)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., at all times, event3 does not happen — equivalently, event3 never occurs at any time)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- C1 is already false at the initial time because the initial condition says event3 happens. Therefore C1 does not hold now.
- Because C1 fails initially, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Even ignoring the initial violation, the transition rules guarantee event3 will occur repeatedly: event3 → event1 → (event2 or event3). If event1 is followed by event2, that forces event3 next; if event1 is followed by event3, event3 occurs immediately. So event3 is inevitable in the execution history. That further confirms C1 cannot hold always, so C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at time 0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event3 must occur next (2 → 3).
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur next (3 → 1).
- After event1 occurs, either event2 or event3 must occur next (1 → (2 or 3)).

(Interpretation: the rules constrain what can follow each event; after 1 the choice is nondeterministic between 2 and 3.)

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (i.e. event2 is guaranteed to occur in the run)
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” (i.e. event1 occurs and event2 always happens)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value
- We know event1 does happen (initially), so the first part of C2 is true.
- But C1 is not guaranteed by the rules: from the initial event1 we may choose event3 next, and then the rules force 1,3,1,3,... alternation forever. Example valid trace: 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, ... In that trace event2 never occurs, so C1 (“event2 always happens”) is false.
- Since C2 is the conjunction “event1 happens AND C1 holds,” and C1 is false, C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False. (If you meant a different formal reading of “always” or “after ...” please specify so I can re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From the initial 1 you can choose 3 and then follow 1,3,1,3,... forever, so event2 need not occur (C1 false); since C2 requires C1, C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.

Step 2 — transition/constraint rules
- After event3, event2 must happen (if event3 occurs, a later event2 is required).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, a later event3 is required).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1, if it occurs, stops any further events).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens"" = event1 ∨ event3.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" = (event1 ∨ event3) ∧ event3. This simplifies to just event3 (because (A ∨ B) ∧ B ≡ B). So C2 is equivalent to ""event3 happens.""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final verdict
- Since event2 already happened, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" requires that event3 occur at some later point.
- Event1 cannot validly occur after this initial event2 because if event1 did occur it would prevent any further events and thus violate the requirement that event3 must happen after event2.
- Therefore event3 does happen, which makes C1 true (via event3) and C2 true (it is equivalent to event3).

Short answer: Undetermined (cannot be decided from the given information).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the initial event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalently, ""Event3 does not happen in the next state"" (so, given the rules, event2 happens next).

4) How they relate
- C2 is simply the negation of C1. Given the rule “after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen,” in any single execution exactly one of C1 or C2 will be true (assuming those two are exclusive).
- But from the information provided, there is no rule that forces event3 rather than event2 after event1. Both continuations are permitted by the rules. Therefore neither C1 nor C2 is entailed by the premises; both are possible. So the truth value of C2 is undetermined (it can be true in some allowed runs and false in others).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the premises, after event1 either event2 or event3 may occur, so C2 (that event3 does not happen next) is not guaranteed — it holds in some allowed executions but not in others. Hence C2 is not entailed as true."

- Events: event1 (E1), event2 (E2), event3 (E3).
- Initial condition: E3 has already happened (it is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After E3, no other events can happen — E3 is terminal; no E1 or E2 can occur after E3.
- After E1, E3 must happen — if E1 occurs, then E3 must occur afterwards.
- After E2, either E1 or E3 must happen — if E2 occurs, then at least one of E1 or E3 must occur afterward.

Because E3 already happened initially and no events can happen after E3, E1 and E2 cannot occur at any time in the given scenario.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens or event2 happens” = E1 ∨ E2.
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens” = (E1 ∨ E2) ∨ E1. (By associativity/commutativity/idempotence this simplifies to E1 ∨ E2, i.e. C2 is logically equivalent to C1.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Since E3 already happened and blocks any further events, both E1 and E2 are false.
- Therefore C1 = E1 ∨ E2 = false.
- C2 is equivalent to C1, so C2 = false.

- Events: event1, event2, event3.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, event1 must happen next. (This is repeated in the statement; it’s the same rule twice.)

(Each “either … or … must happen” means the next event is chosen nondeterministically from the stated options.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens” — there exists some future point in the run where event3 occurs.
- C2: “Event2 happens or C1 holds” — either event2 occurs at some point, or event3 eventually occurs (equivalently: event2 occurs at some point OR event3 occurs at some point).
- (No C3 was provided in the problem.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- From the initial event1, the transition rule requires that the next event is either event2 or event3.
  - Case A: next = event2. Then “event2 happens” is true, so C2 is true.
  - Case B: next = event3. Then event3 has happened, so C1 is true, and therefore C2 (C1 ∨ event2) is true.
- There is no possible run starting from the initial event1 in which neither event2 nor event3 ever happens (the rule after event1 prevents that). Therefore in every possible execution C2 holds.

Conclusion: C2 is True (it is guaranteed by the given initial condition and transition rules).  
(For contrast: C1 alone is not guaranteed — e.g. the run 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → … never reaches event3.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event3, the next event must be event1.
- After event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Most naturally interpreted as “event2 holds at every step (globally)”, i.e. every event occurrence is event2. (If you meant some weaker reading, see note below.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — a conjunction: event2 occurs (true at the initial step) AND event2 always happens (C1).

4) Relation and evaluation
- From the rule “after event2, the next event must be event1 or event3”, it is impossible to have two consecutive event2 occurrences. Therefore event2 cannot hold at every step. So C1 (event2 always happens) is false under the normal “always = at every step” reading.
- Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is false as well (even though event2 does happen initially).

Counterexamples / runs
- A run showing C1 fails: event2, event3, event1, event3, event1, ... (after the initial event2 you can choose event3, and then never return to event2).
- A run showing event2 can reoccur (but still not “always”): event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (event2 occurs infinitely often but not at every step).

Conclusion: Under the standard interpretation of “always,” C1 is false, so C2 is false. (If by “always” you instead meant “ever occurs at least once,” C1 would be true trivially and C2 true — please clarify if you meant a different semantics.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 → event3 must happen (if event1 occurs, it is followed by event3).
- After event3 → event2 must happen.
- After event2 → event3 must happen.
Thus once event3 occurs, it forces event2 next, which forces event3 next, and so on (an alternating chain 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 …). The rule about event1 is irrelevant unless/whenever event1 occurs.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens"" — there exists some time at which event2 or event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — both (a) C1 is true, and (b) event2 occurs at some time.

(There is no C3 given in the hypothesis.)

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- Because event3 already happened initially, C1 is satisfied immediately (event3 occurs).
- Because after event3 must come event2, event2 will occur after that initial event3.
- Therefore both parts of C2 are satisfied: C1 holds, and event2 happens.

- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at time 0 event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2 → event1 must happen next.
- After event3 → event2 must happen next.

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1 as stated: ""Event1 always happens."" The usual plain reading of that is a global/at-every-step claim: at every time point the current event is event1 (i.e. G event1 in temporal-logic notation).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" If C1 is G event1, then C2 is G(G event1). In temporal logic G(G p) is equivalent to G p, so C2 is equivalent to C1. (Intuitively C2 is just the same global claim restated.)

4) How the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- From the rules and initial state, a possible trace is: time0: event2 → time1: event1 → time2: event2 → time3: event1 → … (1 and 2 alternate if 1 always chooses 2). Even if event1 sometimes chooses 3, from 3 you go to 2 and then to 1, so event1 will recur infinitely often.
- But at time0 event1 did NOT occur (event2 did), so the claim ""event1 always happens"" (i.e. at every time point) is false.
- Since C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 is also false.

Short answer: C2 is False. (If instead you meant a weaker property like ""event1 occurs infinitely often"" — that weaker property would be true.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

(“Must happen” is taken as a requirement for the next step; “no other events can happen” means no further events occur after event2.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (the negation of C1).

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- The initial state already has event2. The rule “after event2, no other events can happen” prevents any event from occurring in the next state.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in the next state → C1 is false.
- Since C2 is “C1 does not hold,” C2 is true.

Note on ambiguity: if “no other events can happen” were read to mean “no events other than event2 can happen (but event2 could occur again)”, then C1 could be true and C2 false. Under the usual reading that event2 terminates further events, C2 is true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event3 must occur (next time step).
- After event3 occurs, event2 must occur.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur.

(“Must happen” means the next required occurrence follows whenever the preceding event has occurred.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event3 does not happen” — i.e., there is no time at which event3 occurs.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — i.e., at all times (now and in the future) event3 never occurs.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Start at t0: event2 occurred.
- By the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” at the next step t1 event1 occurs.
- By “after event1, event3 must happen,” at t2 event3 occurs.
- That directly violates C1 (event3 does happen). Therefore C1 is false.
- Since C2 asserts that C1 always holds, and C1 is false (there is a concrete counterexample), C2 is also false.

Additional remark: the rules create a cycle (event2 → event1 → event3 → event2 → …), so event3 will occur (and in fact recur), making any claim that it never happens impossible.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (the immediate next state after event1 has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, event2 must happen (unused here because event3 never occurred).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is redundant and is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event1 must hold (since C1 ≡ event1).

4) How they relate and final truth value
- The transition rule says the next state after the initial state (where event1 happened) must be a state where event2 happens, not event1.
- Therefore C1 (event1) does not hold in that next state.
- So C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed (i.e., it is false as a logical consequence of the context). Now the step-by-step answers you requested.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it is given as true initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (at least one of them occurs later).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 → eventually event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e., event1 → event2, always)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (so C2 is the conjunction: event1 is true AND the implication in C1 is true)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and is C2 true or false)?
- We know event1 is true from the initial condition.
- The context only requires that after event1 either event2 or event3 occurs. It does not require that event2 must always occur. There is a permitted scenario where, after event1, event3 happens immediately. That scenario respects all rules: event1 occurs, then event3 occurs, and since event3 is terminal nothing else happens.
- In that scenario event2 never happens, so the implication in C1 (event1 → event2) is false as a universal rule. Therefore C1 is not entailed by the context (it may be true in some runs but is not guaranteed).
- Since C2 requires both event1 and C1, and C1 is not guaranteed, C2 is not guaranteed either. So C2 is false as a logical consequence of the given context.

(Optionally: C1 could hold in some particular execution if event2 indeed occurs after event1, but it is not forced by the rules.)

- After event3, event2 must happen (the state following an event3 must include event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

(Assumption used: “after X” means the next state after X. If “after” were only “eventually after,” the same ordering still holds.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (Claim that event1 occurs one step after the initial state.)
- C2: “Event3 happens or C1 holds.” (Disjunction: either event3 occurs in the next state, or C1 is true.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- From the initial condition and the rules: initial state has event1, and by the rule “after event1, event3 must happen,” event3 must occur in the next state. Then by “after event3, event2 must happen,” event2 occurs in the state after that, and then nothing further can occur.
- Therefore event3 does happen in the next state. So the disjunction “event3 happens or C1 holds” is true, regardless of whether C1 itself is true.
- Is C1 true? Under the usual reading, no — event1 happened in the initial state, not in the next state, so C1 is false. (Even if C1 were false, C2 is still true because event3 does occur.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so we start in a state after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (i.e. if event2 occurs, the next event must be event1 or event3).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" Interpreting this in the natural ways:
  - As a universal statement over executions: in every possible execution, event3 occurs (at least once).  
  - Or as a temporal “always” (globally) property: event3 is true at all times — either way, it requires event3 to occur or hold.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means there is some future point at which the property C1 becomes true (i.e. from that point onward C1 is satisfied).

Step 4 — how the rules determine truth of C1 and C2
- Because we start after event1 and after event1 no further events can occur, the only possible execution from the initial state is: event1 happened, then termination (no event2 or event3 occurs afterwards).
- Therefore event3 does not occur in that execution.
- Hence C1 (""event3 occurs in every execution"" or ""event3 always holds"") is false (there exists the execution with only event1 and no event3).
- Since C1 is never true at any future point of the actual execution (we immediately terminate after event1), C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: we start after event1, and event1 is terminal so no event3 can ever occur; C1 is false in the only execution, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false."

Short answer: C2 is False (given only the rules stated). Explanation step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (i.e. the system starts in a state after event3).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next (a choice).
- After event2, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreted as: in every possible run/execution, event2 eventually occurs.
- C2: “Event3 happens and C1 holds.” That is (event3 occurs) AND (event2 occurs in every run).

4) How they relate and the truth value of C2
- We do know event3 happens (initially), so the left conjunct of C2 is true.
- But C1 is not guaranteed by the rules as stated: after event3 there is a choice — you may take event2 (ending the run) or take event1, which forces event3 again, and so on. One valid execution (counterexample) is an infinite repetition: 3,1,3,1,3,1,... which never reaches event2. That run respects all rules but never contains event2, so event2 does not “always happen.”
- Therefore C1 is false, and since C2 is a conjunction requiring C1, C2 is false.

Note: If you add an extra assumption (e.g. fairness or a rule forcing that the choice after event3 cannot avoid event2 forever, or that infinite runs are disallowed), then C1 — and hence C2 — could become true. But from the information given, C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts with an occurrence of event1).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → eventually event2)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → eventually event1)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → eventually event2)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreting “happens” in the same temporal sense as the rules, C1 says: every time event2 occurs, event1 will (eventually) occur afterwards.  
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that the implication in C1 is an invariant of the system (true in all executions).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- One of the transition rules is exactly ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That is the same statement as C1 (assuming the same temporal reading). Therefore C1 is entailed by the rules and holds in every allowed execution.
- Hence C2 (the claim that C1 always holds) is True under the given rules.

Example traces to illustrate: starting from the initial event1:
- e1 → (rule) e2 → (rule) e1 → e2 → ... (alternating)
- If e3 occurs at some point: e3 → (rule) e2 → (rule) e1 → ...

No rule allows event2 to occur without a subsequent event1, so C1 is always satisfied; therefore C2 is True.

(If you intended a different reading of “if … then …” — e.g., requiring simultaneity instead of eventuality — say so and I will re-evaluate under that semantics.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event3 has happened (i.e. at the start of consideration event3 is true/has occurred). We assume no other events have already happened unless stated otherwise.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, a later event2 must occur).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, a later event3 must occur).
- After event3, no other events can happen (once event3 occurs, the system stops — no further events are allowed).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens” — there exist times (possibly different) at which event1 and event2 occur.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” — at some point in the future (from the initial state) C1 becomes true (i.e., both event1 and event2 will occur).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because the initial state already has event3 occurred and the rule “after event3, no other events can happen” forbids any further events, neither event1 nor event2 can occur after the initial point.
- Therefore C1 cannot become true in the future, so C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is false.

Note/caveat: If you intended that event1 and event2 could have occurred before the stated “initially event3 happened,” then C1 might already be true and C2 trivially true. Under the usual reading that “initially event3 happened” is the current state and no further events are allowed after it, C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
C2 is False.

Step-by-step answer.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event3 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event3 happens, either event1 or event2 must happen next (nondeterministic choice).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (so event1 is always followed by event2).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (i.e., both events occur at some point in the run.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Reading this in the usual system-verification sense: the system eventually reaches a state where C1 is true. Concretely: along a given execution/run, at some point both event1 and event2 have occurred. (When asking whether C2 is true for the system, we ask whether C2 holds in all possible executions.)

4) How the conditions relate — possible executions
From the initial event3, two possible continuations (by the rule after event3):
- Path A: event3 → event2. Then event2 is terminal, so the run ends. This run contains event2 but not event1. C1 is false on this run.
- Path B: event3 → event1 → event2. This run contains both event1 and event2, so C1 is true on this run.

Conclusion about C2
- C1 holds on some executions (Path B) but not on all (Path A). Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"" as a property of the system) is not guaranteed: C2 is false as a universal system property. (If one instead asks whether C2 is possible/existentially true, the answer is yes — there exists a run where C2 holds.)

Short final answer: C2 is not true in general (it is false as a guaranteed property), though C1 can happen in some runs.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Step-by-step:

1) Initial state: event3 has happened.

2) From event3 the system nondeterministically does either event1 or event2 next.
   - If it chooses event2: sequence is event3 → event2. event2 is terminal, so event1 never occurs on this run.
   - If it chooses event1: sequence is event3 → event1 → event2 (because event1 must be followed by event2). Both event1 and event2 occur on this run.

3) C1 = ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" C1 holds on the run event3 → event1 → event2, but not on the run event3 → event2.

4) C2 is being asked as a system property (i.e., does C1 eventually hold on all executions?). Because there exists at least one execution (event3 → event2) where C1 never holds, C2 is not guaranteed.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
These rules produce a cycle: event1 → event3 → event2 → event1 → ….

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (There is some future time when event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" This is the conjunction: (event3 eventually happens) AND (event3 happens).
  - Note: as stated, C1 already asserts that event3 happens (eventually), so C2 is redundant — it requires the same fact twice.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial event1 and the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" event3 will indeed occur (at least once). So C1 is true.
- Since C1 is true and event3 does happen, the conjunction in C2 is also true.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the system starts at event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2.
(So from any event, the next event must be one of the other two.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens."" Interpreting “happens” as “occurs at some time in the execution,” C1 means both events occur at (possibly different) times in the run.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means in every possible execution (every allowable infinite sequence of events consistent with the rules), C1 is true — i.e., in every possible run both event2 and event3 occur.

4) Relation and evaluation
- C1 can be true in some runs. Example: start at event2, then choose event3 next: sequence 2,3,... so both event2 and event3 have occurred.
- But C1 is not guaranteed in every run. There exist valid runs where event3 never occurs. For example:
  2,1,2,1,2,1,... (always alternate between 2 and 1) is allowed by the rules and never contains event3. In that run C1 is false because event3 never happens.

Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (unless you impose extra fairness or liveness assumptions that force eventually choosing event3). Under the given rules alone, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: the run 2,1,2,1,2,1,... is allowed and never contains event3, so C1 does not hold in every execution."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (i.e., the system starts in a state where event3 occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event3 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event1 is followed later by an occurrence of event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next (a nondeterministic choice: one of them must occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition that event3 already happened, C1 holds (there is an occurrence of event3).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires both that event2 occurs at some point and that event3 occurs at some point.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- C1 is true (it holds in the initial state because event3 has already happened).
- C2 is not guaranteed. From the initial event3, the rule says the next step must be either event1 or event2. Two possible traces illustrate the difference:
  - Trace A (event2 occurs): event3 → event2 (terminal). Here C1 and event2 both hold, so C2 is true in this trace.
  - Trace B (event2 never occurs): event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... (always pick event1 after each event3). Here C1 holds but event2 never happens, so C2 is false in this trace.
- Because there exists at least one valid execution (Trace B) where event2 never occurs, C2 is not necessarily true in all executions. So, depending on interpretation:
  - C2 is satisfiable/possible (there are runs where it is true).
  - C2 is not valid/guaranteed (it can be false in some runs).

Final answer: C2 is not guaranteed (i.e., it is not universally true). It can be true in some executions but false in others.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event3 already holds, but after event3 the system can always choose event1, producing a trace event3 → event1 → event3 → ... where event2 never occurs, so ""event2 happens and C1 holds"" is not guaranteed."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is trivially true (a tautological implication). It holds regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to asserting that event1 happens.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event3 already happened initially and ""after event3 no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event1 or event2) can occur after the initial state.
- Therefore event1 does not happen.
- C1 is true, but C2 asserts event1, which is false in the given context. Hence C2 is false.

Summary answer: C1 is true (entailed by the rules). C2 is false (because event3 does not occur under the given initial condition).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the run starts with event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (i.e. event3 → (event1 ∨ event2)).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 → event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: If event3 happens, then event1 happens. Formally: event3 → event1.
- C2: event3 happens AND C1 holds (i.e. event3 ∧ (event3 → event1)).

4) How do these conditions relate and final evaluation?
- From the rules: event3 → (event1 ∨ event2). But since event2 → event1, any branch where event2 follows event3 still leads to event1. Therefore in all possible continuations after event3, event1 will occur; hence C1 is true (entailed).
- However, given the initial event2, event1 must happen next and event1 is terminal, so no further events (including event3) can occur after the start. There is no rule saying event3 actually happens at any point. Therefore event3 does not occur in the described scenario, so the conjunction ""event3 happens and C1 holds"" (C2) is false.

Conclusion: C1 = True; C2 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the start event2 occurs, which forces event1 next and event1 is terminal—so event3 never happens. Although C1 (event3 → event1) is entailed, C2 requires event3 to occur as well, so C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal.)
So the allowed timeline given the initial condition is: event1 → event2 → end. event3 is not forced by any rule.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens"" (event2 ∨ event3).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (event1 → (event2 ∨ event3)).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- From the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we have: event1 → event2.
- From event1 → event2, it follows that event1 → (event2 ∨ event3) (because event2 implies event2 ∨ event3).
- Therefore C2 (event1 → (event2 ∨ event3)) is entailed by the given rules and the initial condition. In the actual timeline (event1 then event2), C1 is true (event2 holds), so the implication in C2 is true as well.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: the rules give event1 → event2. From that, event1 → (event2 ∨ event3) follows (since event2 implies event2 ∨ event3). Thus C2 (event1 → (event2 ∨ event3)) is entailed."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so ""event1"" is true in the scenario).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen (so from event1 we infer event3 will occur).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs then event1 must follow).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event1). Given the initial condition, C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., event3 ∨ C1).

Step 4 — how they relate and final conclusion
- From the initial fact event1 and the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"", we infer event3 does happen.
- Therefore the disjunction event3 ∨ C1 is true (because event3 is true), regardless of C1 being false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened initially (i.e., at the start of the timeline).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, event3 must happen (event2 → eventually event3).
- After event3 happens, event2 must happen (event3 → eventually event2).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (event1 → eventually event2).

(“After X, Y must happen” I read as: whenever X occurs, Y will occur later — i.e., X forces Y to occur eventually.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens and event2 happens.” This can be read two ways:
  a) Conjunctive occurrence at the same moment: there is a timepoint where both event3 and event2 are true simultaneously.
  b) Both events occur somewhere on the timeline (not necessarily simultaneously).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” — there will be some future time at which C1 is true. Under reading (a) this means “there will be a time when both are true together.” Under reading (b) this means “event2 and event3 will both have occurred at (possibly different) times by some point.”

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event3, by the rule “after event3, event2 must happen,” event2 will occur at some later time. So both event3 (initially) and event2 (soon after) occur on the timeline. That already makes C1 true under interpretation (b) (both have occurred).
- Once event2 occurs, the rule “after event2, event3 must happen” ensures event3 will occur again later, producing an alternating sequence (event3 → event2 → event3 → ...). So there will certainly be times where both have occurred (and in fact both will keep occurring infinitely often).
- If you require simultaneous truth (interpretation a), you must know whether events can be true at the same time. If events are instantaneous and cannot coincide, then there may be no single timepoint with both true simultaneously, so C1 (simultaneous) would not hold and C2 would be false under that strict reading. If “happened” is persistent (once true it stays true) or simultaneous occurrence is allowed, then after event2 occurs you will have a state where both are true, so C1 and therefore C2 are true.

Conclusion (concise)
- Under the usual reading that “after X, Y must happen” means X forces Y to happen later, and that “C1” means “both events occur sometime (not necessarily exactly at the same instant),” C2 is True.
- If you instead require that C1 be true at a single instant (simultaneous occurrence) and events are instantaneous and non-coincident, then C2 would be False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event3 holds initially and the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" guarantees event2 will occur later, so both events occur on the timeline (making C1 true at some point), hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially (call it state S0): event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event3, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
So the system cycles: 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → ...

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" Formally, at a state s, C1(s) = (event3 holds at s.next).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Formally, at state s, C2(s) = C1(s.next) = (event3 holds at s.next.next). So C2 asserts event3 two steps ahead.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From S0: event1 (given).
- By the rule after event1, S1 must have event3 → C1 at S0 is true.
- By the rule after event3, S2 must have event2 → event3 does NOT hold at S2.
- Therefore C2 at S0 (which requires event3 at S2) is false.

Conclusion: C1 is true at the initial state; C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: S0 has event1, so S1 must have event3 (C1 true at S0). But S2 must have event2, so event3 does not hold at S2; hence C2 (requiring event3 at S2) is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e. the system starts in a state where event2 has just occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is a terminal/absorbing event).
- After event1, event3 must happen (event1 → next: event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (event3 → next: event1 or event2).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens."" Interpreting this as a state/formula that is true at a time point when either event3 occurs at that time or event1 occurs at that time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" In temporal terms: at some future time (possibly now or later) either event3 or event1 will occur.

(There was no C3 defined in the hypothesis; if you meant another condition, say which one.)

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- The initial event2 has occurred, and the rule “after event2, no other events can happen” means no event1 or event3 can ever occur after the start. Therefore C1 is false now and will never become true.
- Consequently C2 (""eventually C1"") is false.

Note on assumptions: This conclusion assumes the natural reading that ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no further events of any type can occur from that point onward. If that phrase were meant only for an immediate next-step restriction (not forever), the answer could differ — but under the usual interpretation above, C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: the system starts with event2 and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" makes event2 absorbing, so neither event1 nor event3 can occur now or later. Hence C1 never holds, so ""eventually C1"" (C2) is false. (If ""after event2"" were intended only for the immediate next step rather than forever, the result could differ.)"

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen (so from event2 we get event3 eventually).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so from event3 we get event1 eventually).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from event1 we get event2 eventually).
Thus starting from the initial event2 there is an enforced cycle: event2 → event3 → event1 → event2 → …

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — this is equivalent to just ""event3 happens"" (A ∧ A ≡ A).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — equivalently C2 = event1 ∨ event3.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial event2 and the transition rules, event3 must happen (and then event1 must happen afterwards). So event3 is true (and event1 is also true eventually).
- Therefore C1 is true, and hence C2 = event1 ∨ event3 is true (indeed both disjuncts become true).

Conclusion: C2 is True.

True

- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → event3)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (event3 → event1 OR event2)

3) What the sub-conditions mean

- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" = (Event1 ∧ Event3) ∧ Event3. This is logically equivalent to Event1 ∧ Event3 (so C2 is equivalent to C1). (No C3 was given.)

4) How these conditions relate, and whether C2 is true
- From the initial event2, event3 must occur next. After that there are two possible continuations:
  - Branch A: choose event1 after event3. Sequence: event2 → event3 → event1. Then Event1 and Event3 both occurred, so C1 (and therefore C2) is true in this trace.
  - Branch B: choose event2 after event3, leading to event2 → event3 → event2 → ... (possibly indefinitely). In such traces event1 may never occur, so C1 (and C2) is false in those traces.
- Therefore C2 is satisfiable (true in some possible executions) but not entailed by the rules (not true in all executions). In plain terms: C2 is not guaranteed — it may be true or false depending on the nondeterministic choices.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: from event2 we get event3, and after event3 we may choose event2 again, producing traces where event1 never occurs. Thus C2 (which requires event1) is not guaranteed (though it is satisfiable in some traces)."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the sequence starts with event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (1 → 2).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (2 → {1, 3}).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (3 → {1, 2}).

So possible infinite traces include, for example:
- 1,2,1,2,1,2,... (always choose 1 after 2)
- 1,2,3,1,2,3,... (choose 3 after 2 and 1 after 3)
- 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,... etc.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event1 happens."" I read this as: in the execution at some times both event3 and event1 occur (each at least once).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The natural reading is universal: for every possible execution (given the rules) C1 is true — i.e., in every possible trace both event1 and event3 occur at some point. (If you meant a different reading of “always” — e.g. “at every time instant both events are true” — that is impossible for discrete, distinct events.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- C1 is satisfiable: for example the trace 1,2,3 contains both event1 and event3, so C1 can be true in some executions.
- C2 is false: there exists a permitted execution that never contains event3 (e.g. 1,2,1,2,1,2,... — after every event2 choose event1). In that trace event3 never happens, so C1 is false there. Therefore C1 does not hold in all possible executions.

Answer: C2 is False.

False

- After event3, event2 must happen. (If event3 occurs, then later event2 occurs.)

I read ""After X, Y must happen"" as: whenever X has occurred, Y will occur at some later time (i.e., an obligational/implicational temporal rule).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initially) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event3 must occur later. (If event1 happens at time t, there exists t' > t with event3.)
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur later. (If event3 happens at time t, there exists t' > t with event1.)
- After event2 occurs, event3 must occur later. (If event2 happens at time t, there exists t' > t with event3.)

(Informally: event2 → eventually event3; event3 → eventually event1; event1 → eventually event3. With event2 true initially, the rules force event3 and then event1 and then event3 again, etc.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is naturally read as the claim that event2 never occurs (i.e., there is no time at which event2 happens). If one instead reads C1 as ""event2 does not happen now,"" the conclusions below are the same because the initial state contradicts that reading as well.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This says C1 is true at every time (i.e., the statement ""event2 never occurs"" holds globally). Practically it asserts that event2 never happens (at any time) and that that fact is invariant.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and to the context?
- The context directly contradicts C1: the initial condition states event2 did happen. So C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, the statement C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Therefore C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is contradicted by the initial condition that event2 did happen, so C1 is false; hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition given: initially, event1 happened (so at time 0, event1 has occurred).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (the system becomes terminal).
- Likewise, after event2 occurs, no other events can happen.
- Likewise, after event3 occurs, no other events can happen.
(So any event, once it occurs, prevents any further events.)

3) What do the conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Interpreted naturally as the proposition that event1 never occurs (or at least is not true at the relevant time).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" i.e., at all times (or as an invariant) C1 is true — equivalently, event1 never happens at any time.

4) How do they relate and final evaluation?
- The context states that event1 did happen initially. That makes the proposition ""event1 does not happen"" (C1) false at the initial time.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds at all times. Because C1 is already false at the initial time, C2 cannot be true.
- Therefore C2 is False.

(If you intended a different temporal reading of C1 — for example, ""event1 does not happen in the future"" — say so and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation. Under the usual reading that C1 asserts event1 never occurs, C2 is definitely false because event1 did occur initially.)

False

Summary answer: C2 is False (under the usual reading that exactly the required ""after"" event occurs next). Below are the step-by-step answers.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happens in the initial state (call it state S0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event3 must occur in the next state.
- After event3 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state.
- After event2 occurs, event3 must occur in the next state.
(Interpretation used below: these are mandatory next-state obligations; we take the minimal/standard interpretation that the named required event happens in the next state.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens"" — i.e., in a given state, at least one of event1 or event3 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately following the current one, either event1 or event3 must be true.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation of C2
- Start at S0: event3 is true, so C1 holds in S0 (because event3 is true).
- By the rule ""after event3 → event2"", the next state S1 must have event2.
- In S1 we therefore have event2 (and, under the minimal interpretation, not event1 or event3).
- So in S1, C1 (event1 OR event3) is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

Note about alternative interpretations: if you allow events to co-occur and nothing forbids event3 also happening in S1, then C2 could be true in a model where S1 contains event2 and also event3. With the usual intended reading of the given ""after"" rules as forcing the single required next event, C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur (event3 → event1).
- After event1 occurs, event3 must occur (event1 → event3).
  - Together these two force an alternating/recurring pair: once event1 occurs it forces event3 next, which forces event1 again, etc.
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This is just a redundant way of stating “Event2 happens.” So C1 ≡ (event2 happens).
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” So C2 ≡ (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens).

Step 4 — how they relate and the truth of C2
- From the context we know event1 does happen (initially). That makes the first half of C2 true.
- Nothing in the context asserts that event2 happens, nor is there a rule that forces event2 to occur. So whether event2 happens is not determined by the given information.

Conclusion (truth value of C2)
- Under an open-world reading (you only know what is stated): C2 is not provable/undetermined — you cannot conclude C2 is true, nor can you conclude it is false from the given facts.
- Under a closed-world / “if not stated then false” reading (common in many logic puzzles and databases): event2 is taken to be false, so C1 is false and therefore C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is not provably true from the given information. If you assume the usual closed-world assumption then C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 requires event2 to occur; only event1 is given and no rule forces event2, so C2 is not satisfied (under the usual closed-world reading it is false)."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e., event1 will occur sometime after any event2).
- After event1 occurs, either event2 or event3 must occur (i.e., at least one of them will occur sometime after any event1).
- After event3 occurs, either event1 or event2 must occur (i.e., at least one of them will occur sometime after any event3).

Step 3 — meaning of sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” (There is some future point at which event2 occurs.)
- C2: “Event3 happens and C1 holds.” (So C2 requires both that event3 occurs at least once and that event2 eventually occurs.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the rules and the initial event1 we know at least one of event2 or event3 must occur after the initial event1. But the rules do not force both to occur.
- C2 is satisfiable (there are executions where both event3 happens and event2 eventually happens), but it is not guaranteed by the rules. In other words, C2 is possible but not entailed.

Counterexamples showing C2 can be false:
- Trace A (C1 true, C2 false): event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (event2 occurs repeatedly, event3 never occurs → C1 true, C2 false).
- Trace B (C1 false, C2 false): event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → … (event3 occurs but event2 never does → C1 false, so C2 false).

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true given the context. It can hold in some runs, but it can also fail in valid runs; therefore it is not guaranteed.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (event2 repeats, event3 never occurs). This satisfies the rules but makes C2 false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions

Step 2 — transition rules

- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 implies event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (so if event3 has occurred, event1 and event2 cannot occur afterwards).

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally C2 ≡ (C1 → event2).

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3 happens, no other events can happen (it blocks any later events).
- After event1 happens, event3 must happen.
- After event2 happens, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (logical implication: event2 ⇒ event1)
- C2: ""Event1 happens AND C1 holds.""

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Because event3 happened initially and that blocks any subsequent events, neither event1 nor event2 can occur after that initial event3. So in the actual scenario, event1 does not happen and event2 does not happen.
- Evaluate C1: In standard (material) logic a conditional with a false antecedent is true, so since event2 cannot occur the statement ""if event2 then event1"" is vacuously true. Thus C1 holds.
- Evaluate C2: C2 requires event1 to happen and C1 to hold. C1 holds, but event1 does not happen, so the conjunction is false.

Answer: C2 is False.

(If you read the conditionals as non‑material causal rules rather than material implications, you might refuse to assert C1 from the given rules — but in either reading C2 is still false because event1 does not occur.)

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it time t0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules (interpretation: “after X” = in the next state)
- After event3, event1 must happen in the next state: event3 -> next: event1.
- After event1, event3 must happen in the next state: event1 -> next: event3.
- After event2, event3 must happen in the next state: event2 -> next: event3.

(So event1 and event3 force each other in alternation: 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 ...)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is redundant; it is equivalent to simply “event1 happens” in a given state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the state immediately following the current one, event1 holds.

(There is no C3 given in the problem.)

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation of C2
- At t0 (initial) event1 holds, so C1 is true at t0.
- By the rule “after event1, event3 must happen,” the next state t1 must have event3 (not event1).
- Therefore at t1, event1 does not hold, so C1 is false at t1.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds at t1; since C1 is false at t1, C2 is false.

Note on alternative interpretations: If you allowed multiple events to occur simultaneously in a state (so t1 could contain both event3 and event1), then C2 could be true. Under the usual “single event per state / next-state” reading used above, C2 is False.

Final answer: C2 is False (given the standard next-state interpretation).

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed (so “False” if you mean “must hold given the rules”). Explanation step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next (nondeterministic choice).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next (nondeterministic choice).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event3 eventually happens” — there is some later moment in the run where event3 occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens” — event3 eventually happens AND event2 happens (note: event2 already happened initially, so the latter conjunct is already satisfied in the initial state).

4) How the conditions relate and final verdict
- From the rules you cannot force event3 to occur: after any event2 the system may choose event1 instead of event3. That yields the infinite trace: event2 (initial), event1, event2, event1, event2, ... with event3 never occurring. This is allowed by the rules.
- Therefore C1 (event3 eventually happens) is not guaranteed; it is possible but not necessary.
- Because C1 can be false in some allowed runs, the conjunction C2 is likewise not guaranteed. (Even though event2 has happened, C2 requires C1 as well.)

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true (i.e., false as a logical consequence of the premises). It can be true in some runs (if the choice after some event2 picks event3), but it is not guaranteed.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: follow the allowed trace event2 (initial), event1, event2, event1, event2, ... — event2 occurs but event3 never does, so C1 fails and hence C2 (C1 ∧ event2) is not guaranteed."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it is true in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event3 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs, then event3 will occur afterward).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event3 will occur afterward).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

(Interpretation note: “after X, Y must happen” is read as “if X occurs, then Y will occur at some later point.”)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens and event3 happens.” This is the claim that both event1 and event3 occur (not necessarily simultaneously; typically: both have occurred at some points in the run).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” This means that at some time in the execution/run we reach a state where C1 is true (i.e., both event1 and event3 have occurred by that time).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other / final evaluation?
- Since event1 has already happened initially and the rule “after event1, event3 must happen” enforces that event3 will occur later, both event1 and event3 will occur in the run. Therefore C1 is satisfied.
- Because C1 will become true (indeed it becomes true once event3 occurs after the initial event1), C2 — which states that C1 eventually holds — is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is not guaranteed (so false if you claim it must hold). It can be true in some runs but is not necessarily true in all runs.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened (so the current state is immediately after event3).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next (at least one of them; choice is nondeterministic).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; it is equivalent to asserting ""event2 happens"" in the relevant state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" So C2 asserts ""in the next state, event2 happens"" (i.e., the next event is event2).

4) Relation and evaluation
- From the initial state (after event3), the transition rule says the next event is either event1 or event2. That means event2 next is allowed but not forced.
- Therefore C2 (that event2 holds in the next state) is not guaranteed. There are two kinds of runs:
  - A run where the next event is event2: event3 -> event2 -> event3 -> ... (here C2 is true).
  - A run where the next event is event1: event3 -> event1 (then stops) (here C2 is false).

Conclusion: C2 is not necessarily true. If you mean “C2 must hold in all possible executions,” then C2 is false. If you mean “C2 is possible in some execution,” then it is true (there exists an execution where C2 holds).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial point).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen (i.e. event3 implies that later event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen (event1 implies later event3).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: from the current point in time there will be some future point when event1 occurs (temporal F event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: at every point in time (or in every reachable state/execution) C1 is true — equivalently G(F event1) or ""in all executions/at all states, event1 will eventually occur.""

4) How they relate and final reasoning
- Because event2 has already happened initially and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" makes the trace terminal, no further events can occur after the initial state.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur now or later in the actual (initial) execution: C1 is false in the initial state.
- Since C1 does not hold in the initial state, it is not true that C1 always holds. Hence C2 is false.

Counterexample (explicit): the actual run starting with event2 and then nothing else shows C1 fails, so C2 (which demands C1 in all states/executions) is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 has already happened and is terminal (""after event2 no other events can happen""), so event1 cannot occur in the actual execution; thus C1 is false at the initial state, so it cannot be true at all states—C2 is false."

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 = True at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened, event2 and event3 cannot happen afterwards — effectively event2 = False and event3 = False in any continuation that respects the rule.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" (If event3 ever happens it would be terminal, but this is moot if event1 already forbids further events.)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 were to happen, event1 must also happen afterward. But event1 already happened initially, and rule “after event1 no other events can happen” prevents event2 from occurring after event1.)

Given event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after it, neither event2 nor event3 can occur at all.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: (event3) OR (event2).
- C2: (event2) OR (C1). Note C2 simplifies logically to event2 OR event3 (i.e., C2 ≡ C1), because C1 = event2 ∨ event3 so C2 = event2 ∨ (event2 ∨ event3) = event2 ∨ event3.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what are their truth values?
- From the rules and the initial condition we have event2 = False and event3 = False.
- Therefore C1 = False ∨ False = False.
- Since C2 ≡ C1 (and directly C2 = False ∨ False), C2 = False.

Answer: C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (i.e. the initial state is that event1 occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1 is written as ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" which simplifies to just ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""eventually, event2 happens"" (there exists some future point at which event2 occurs).

4) How these relate and evaluation
- Because the initial state is that event1 has happened, and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prohibits any subsequent events, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens"") is false and will never become true.
- Consequently C2 (""eventually event2 happens"") is false.

So C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happens initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen (i.e., next event ∈ {event1, event3}).
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen (next ∈ {event2, event3}).
- After event3: event2 must happen (next = event2).
(The last line repeats the same rule for event3.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event1 happens.” (Reads as a conditional: whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs. This could be read as “next” or “eventually,” but either reading will be addressed below.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (C1 is true at every time point / in every reachable situation.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; does C2 hold?
- From the rules we can construct a valid execution trace starting from the initial state:
  event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ...
  This is allowed because after event3 the rule forces event2, and after event2 one allowed choice is event3.
- In that trace, event2 occurs many times, but after those occurrences the next event is event3, not event1. Therefore:
  - If C1 is read as “immediately after event2 the next event must be event1,” that is false (because next could be event3).
  - If C1 is read as “event1 eventually follows every event2,” that is also false (the infinite 2↔3 loop can avoid event1 forever).
- Because there is a valid behavior of the system that violates C1, C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 (e1), event2 (e2), event3 (e3).
- Initial condition: e3 has happened (we are in a state labelled e3).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After e1 → next is either e2 or e3.
- After e2 → next must be e3.
- After e3 → next is either e1 or e2.
(You repeated the e3 rule twice; it’s the same rule: from e3 the successor is e1 or e2.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens"" — i.e. the current state satisfies (e1 OR e3).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this says something about the immediate successor state of the current state. Important: this can be read two ways:
  - Existential reading (∃ next): there exists a next state where C1 holds.
  - Universal reading (∀ next): in every possible next state, C1 holds.

Step 4 — relate them and evaluate
- At the initial state (e3): C1 is true now, because e3 occurred.
- From e3 the possible next states are: e1 or e2.
  - If next = e1, then C1 holds (e1 satisfies e1 OR e3).
  - If next = e2, then C1 does not hold (e2 is neither e1 nor e3).

Conclusion — truth value of C2
- Under the existential reading (""there exists a next state where C1 holds""): C2 is true (because e3 → e1 is a possible successor and that successor satisfies C1).
- Under the universal reading (""for all next states, C1 holds""): C2 is false (because the successor e2 does not satisfy C1).

If you intended a particular reading (∃ vs ∀), pick the corresponding answer above.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: from the initial state e3 the possible next states are e1 and e2. e1 satisfies C1 but e2 does not, so C1 does not hold in every immediate successor. (If you meant ""there exists a next state where C1 holds"" then C2 would be True, but under the usual universal reading ""holds in the next state"" it is False.)"

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is a terminating event).

- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (so C2 is true exactly when (event1 or event3) is true AND event2 also happens).

- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs, a later event2 must occur.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (A next event after event2 is either event1 or event3.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (If event3 occurs, a later event1 must occur.)

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e. at least one of event1 or event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — logically C2 = (event1 ∨ event2) ∧ event1, which simplifies to event1. So C2 is simply the statement that event1 happens.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- From the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"", either event1 occurs next, or event3 occurs next.
- If event1 occurs next, then event1 has happened (C2 true).
- If event3 occurs next, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur afterward. So in this branch event1 also happens.
- Therefore in all possible continuations starting from the initial event2, event1 will inevitably occur. Hence C1 is true (initially event2 is true) and C2 (which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"") is true.

Answer: C2 is True.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" In plain form: (event3 does not happen) ⇒ (event3 happens).

- Since event1 happened initially and the rule “after event1 no other events can happen” forbids event3 from occurring after that, there is no opportunity for event3 to occur.

- C2 asserts that if event3 does not happen, then event3 happens. That is an implication with a true antecedent (C1) and a false consequent (event3 happens). Hence the implication is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (one of them will occur next).
- After event3, event1 must happen (event3 ⇒ event1 follows).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., in the execution under consideration, event1 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted naturally as: C1 is true (holds) in the situation under consideration — equivalently, event1 never happens in every possible execution/state the statement quantifies over.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- From the initial event2, the rules force either event1 immediately or event3 next.
- If event1 happens immediately, C1 is false.
- If event3 happens next, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur later, so C1 is still false.
- Therefore in every possible continuation from the initial state, event1 will occur. So C1 is false, and consequently C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at the current state (call it s0) event3 has just happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event3, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen in the next state.
(""Must"" = required; the third rule allows a choice between event1 or event3.)

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" Interpreting from s0, C1 means event3 occurs at s1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means at s1 the formula C1 is true, i.e. at s2 event3 occurs. So C2 says: event3 occurs at s2 (two steps from now).

4) How the conditions relate and the truth value of C2
- From s0 we know event3 happened, so by the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen,"" s1 must have event2. Therefore C1 (event3 at s1) is false — s1 cannot be event3.
- From s1 (event2), the rule says s2 must be either event1 or event3. So event3 at s2 (C2) is possible but not guaranteed: one allowed trace is s0: event3 → s1: event2 → s2: event3 (C2 true); another allowed trace is s0: event3 → s1: event2 → s2: event1 (C2 false).
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the rules. If the question is whether C2 must be true, the answer is: False (it is possible but not guaranteed).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (assumption: ""after X, Y must happen"" means in the immediate next state)
- After event2 ⇒ next state must have event3.
- After event3 ⇒ next state must have event1.
- After event1 ⇒ next state must have event3.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as: at every time point t, event1 holds (globally true).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Interpreted as: at time t+1, C1 is true (i.e., from t+1 onward event1 holds at every time).

(There was no C3 in the hypothesis; if you meant something else, say so.)

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Start at t0: event3 (given). By the rule after event3 ⇒ next must be event1, so:
  t1: event1.
- By after event1 ⇒ next must be event3:
  t2: event3.
- By the rule after event3 ⇒ t3: event1, and so on.

So the system produces the infinite alternation: t0: event3, t1: event1, t2: event3, t3: event1, ...

- C1 (event1 at every time) is false: at t0 (and at every even t≥0 like t2, t4) event1 does not hold.
- C2 asks whether C1 is true at t1. At t1 the future is t1:event1, t2:event3,... so event1 is not true at every future time (t2 is event3), hence C1 does not hold at t1. Therefore C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False — at t1 event1 holds but C1 requires event1 at every time; t2 is event3, so C1 is not true at t1, hence C2 is false."

I'll answer step by step. First I'll state the assumptions I use (so the conclusion is clear).

Assumption: exactly one event occurs in each state (events are mutually exclusive per state). If you allow multiple events in a single state, see the note at the end — the answer can change.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at the current (initial) state s0, event3 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event1 must happen in the next state. (If s_n has event3, then s_{n+1} has event1.)
- After event1, event3 must happen in the next state. (If s_n has event1, then s_{n+1} has event3.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen in the next state. (If s_n has event2, then s_{n+1} ∈ {event1, event3}.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Interpreted at the current state s0, C1 means s1 has event2.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” Interpreted at s0, C2 means that at s1 the statement C1 is true — i.e., s2 has event2. (Formally C2 = X(C1) = X X(event2) — event2 occurs two steps ahead.)

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- From s0: event3. By the rule “after event3, event1 must happen,” s1 must be event1. By “after event1, event3 must happen,” s2 must be event3. So the forced sequence (under the one-event-per-state assumption) is: s0: event3, s1: event1, s2: event3, s3: event1, ...
- Therefore:
  - C1 (s1 is event2) is false because s1 is event1.
  - C2 (s2 is event2) is also false because s2 is event3.
- Conclusion: C2 is False.

Note on alternate interpretation (events may co-occur): if a state may contain multiple events simultaneously, then the rules as stated only force that certain events must be present in the next state but do not forbid extra events. In that case:
- C1 could be true if s1 contains event2 in addition to event1.
- C2 could be true if s2 contains event2 (even though it must contain event3 because of event1 in s1).
So under the “multiple events per state allowed” reading, C2 may be satisfiable; under the usual exclusive-event-per-state reading, C2 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: s0 has event3, so s1 must be event1 (not event2), and then s2 must be event3. Thus C1 (event2 at s1) is false and so C2 (event2 at s2) is false under the one-event-per-state assumption. (If states may contain multiple events, C2 could be true.)"

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event3 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event1 must happen (i.e., in the next state following event3, event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., event1 leads to a terminal state — no further events after it).
- After event2, event3 must happen (not relevant here because event2 did not occur).

(Assumption made below: “after X” means “in the next state following a state where X happened.”)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state.” That asserts that in the state immediately after the initial state, event3 occurs.
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” That asserts both (a) event1 happens in the next state and (b) event3 also happens in the next state.

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluation
- From the rule “after event3, event1 must happen,” the next state must include event1.
- The same rule does not require event3 to occur again in that next state; in fact, because “after event1, no other events can happen,” once event1 has occurred the system is terminal thereafter. Under the standard interpretation that exactly the mandated event(s) occur in the next state, the next state contains event1 but not event3.
- Therefore C1 (“event3 in the next state”) is false.
- C2 requires both event1 and C1. Even though event1 does occur in the next state, C1 is false, so C2 is false.

Note on ambiguity: if you allow multiple events to occur simultaneously in a state, one could imagine a semantics where the next state contains both event1 and event3. That would violate the usual reading of “after event3, event1 must happen” as a single next-step occurrence and also conflicts with “after event1, no other events can happen” if that forbids co-occurrence. Given the common sequential reading, C2 is false.

Final answer: C2 is False.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (the execution starts with event3).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (2 -> 1).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (1 -> {2,3}).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (3 -> {1,2}).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event1 happens and event3 happens.” Interpreted as: in the execution/run both event1 and event3 occur at some points (not necessarily simultaneously).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreted as: in every possible execution consistent with the rules, C1 is true (i.e., every execution contains both event1 and event3).

4) How they relate / proof
Start from the initial event3 (so event3 already occurred).
- From event3 the next step must be either event1 or event2.
  - If the next step is event1, then the run contains both event3 (initial) and event1 — C1 holds.
  - If the next step is event2, then by the rule after event2, event1 must happen next; so the run will contain event2 then event1, and since event3 was initial, again both event3 and event1 occur — C1 holds.

There is no choice that avoids event1 (because 3 -> {1,2} and 2 -> 1), and event3 already happened initially. Therefore in every possible execution both event1 and event3 occur, so C1 holds in all executions. Hence C2 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Proof sketch: execution starts with event3. From event3 the next step must be 1 or 2. If it is 1, then event1 occurs (so both event3 and event1 have occurred). If it is 2, then by the rule 2 -> 1 the next step must be 1, so event1 still occurs. Thus every possible execution contains both event3 (initial) and event1, so C1 holds in all executions."

Short answer: C2 is not true (it is not entailed). You can make it false by a valid transition. Below are the steps you asked for.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state S0, event3 happened.

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next. (This line was repeated, same rule.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” — i.e., in the current state/event set, event2 is absent.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e., in the immediate successor state (the state after the current one) event2 does not happen.

4) How these conditions relate and final determination
- From the initial state S0 (event3), the rule “after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen” forces the next state S1 to contain either event1 or event2.
- C2 asserts that event2 does not happen in S1. But the rules allow S1 to be the case where event2 happens. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.
- Concrete counterexample trace: S0: event3. Choose the allowed successor S1: event2. Then C1 is false in S1, so C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is not true (not entailed). It may hold in some allowed traces (if S1 is event1) but it can fail in others, so it cannot be concluded true.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially (i.e. at the start of the run).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event3 is required next).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (non-deterministic choice).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" — means in the timeline/run there is no occurrence of event3.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — means C1 is true globally (i.e. event3 never happens at any point).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Since event2 has already happened initially and the rule says ""after event2, event3 must happen"", event3 must occur at some point in the run. Therefore C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
- Because C1 is false, it cannot be that C1 always holds. Hence C2 is false.

(You can also see a minimal trace: initial event2 → event3 (forced) → then either event1 (terminal) or event2 (then repeats). In every possible continuation event3 occurs at least once, so C1 and thus C2 are false.)

False

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (we are in a state reached right after event3).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen next (deterministic).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (nondeterministic choice).
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal state).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible future run (from the current state) event2 will occur at some point (i.e., inevitability of event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the immediate next state (the state you reach after the next required transition), C1 is true when considered from that state.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial state (after event3), the next required step is event1, so the next state is the state reached after event1.
- From a state after event1, the system can choose event2 (leading to termination) or choose event3 and return to the situation ""after event3"" (which forces event1 again). That yields a possible infinite cycle: ... event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ...
- Because of that possible cycle, there is a valid execution in which event2 never occurs. Therefore C1 (event2 inevitably happens in every future) is false.
- Since the next state is ""after event1"", and from there the same nondeterministic choice allows indefinitely returning to event3 without ever taking event2, C1 is also false in that next state. Hence C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

False

Reason: From the next state (after event1) the system can loop event1↔event3 indefinitely and avoid event2, so ""event2 always happens"" (C1) is false there; therefore C2 is false."

- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, then event2 will occur afterward).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is redundant; in standard logic it is equivalent to the single proposition ""event2 happens."" (If the intent were “event2 happens twice,” that is a different, stronger claim.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" In temporal terms, C2 says “event2 will happen at some future time.”

Step 4 — how they relate and final conclusion
- Because initially event3 has happened and the rule “after event3, no other events can happen” holds, no further events can occur at all. Therefore event2 cannot occur now or in the future.
- Hence C1 (event2 happens) is false, and therefore C2 (event2 eventually happens) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If you intended C1 to mean “event2 happens twice,” the same conclusion holds: once event2 happens no other events can occur, so two occurrences are impossible under the given rules.)

Answer: C2 is false (not guaranteed). Step‑by‑step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen (1 -> 3).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (2 -> 1 or 3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (3 -> 1 or 2).

These are nondeterministic choices where more than one successor may be possible.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Interpreting this as an invariant along a run: at every step of the run the current event is event3.
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens.” Interpreting “event1 happens” as there exists some future step on the run where event1 occurs. So C2 means either the run is all event3, or event1 occurs at least once on the run.

4) How they relate and counterexample
- Start at event2. From 2 we may choose 3, and from 3 we may choose 2, producing the infinite run:
  2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, ...
  In this run:
  - event1 never occurs, so the “event1 happens” disjunct is false.
  - event3 does not always happen (every other step is event2), so C1 is false.
  Thus C2 (C1 or event1 happens) is false on this run.

Conclusion: Because such a run is allowed by the rules, C2 is not universally true. (It may hold on some runs, but it is not guaranteed in all runs.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Counterexample: Start at event2 and repeatedly choose 3 then 2 to get the infinite run 2,3,2,3,... On this run event1 never occurs and event3 does not always hold, so C2 is not guaranteed."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event2 happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen (so if current state has event2, the next state has event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so event3 → next is event1).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event1 → next is event3).

These rules generate the state sequence starting at s0:
- s0: event2
- s1: event3 (because event2 → event3)
- s2: event1 (because event3 → event1)
- s3: event3 (because event1 → event3)
- s4: event1, s5: event3, ... — from s1 onward it alternates between event3 and event1.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (In temporal logic notation, X(event2).)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (Globally: G(C1) — in every state, the next state has event2.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation
- Look at s0 (the initial state). The next state s1 has event3, not event2. So C1 is false at s0.
- Because C1 is already false at s0, C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false as well — a single counterexample state suffices.
- More generally, by the transition rules no next state ever contains event2 (transitions produce only event3 or event1), so C1 is false in every state and therefore C2 is false.

Conclusion
C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 asserts that in every state the next state has event2. At the initial state s0 the next state s1 has event3 (not event2), so C1 fails at s0 and therefore C2 is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the start/event0 the system is in a state where event2 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, event1 must happen (whenever event3 occurs, it must be followed by event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as: in the (relevant) run(s)/execution(s) of the system, event1 occurs (in every execution or at every reachable future — the natural reading is that event1 occurs in the actual execution).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" That means event2 occurs and, in addition, event1 always occurs.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- The initial condition directly gives that event2 happens.
- But after event2 no other events can happen, so once event2 has happened there can be no subsequent event1 (unless event1 already happened earlier). Given the stated initial condition (""Initially, event2 happened"") there is no prior event1; thus event1 does not occur in that execution.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false in the given scenario.
- C2 requires both event2 to happen (true) and C1 to hold (false). Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event1 must happen (whenever event3 occurs, event1 will occur subsequently).
- After event1, event3 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, event3 will occur subsequently).
- After event2, event3 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event3 will occur subsequently).

From the first two rules we get a forced alternation: event1 → event3 → event1 → ... . The third rule says if event2 ever happens it produces event3 (and then event1, etc.). Nothing in the rules produces event2.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" A conjunction: both events must occur (at some times; event1 already holds initially).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" There will be a future time (possibly now) at which both event2 and event1 have happened (equivalently: event2 occurs at some point, since event1 already occurred initially).

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- Since event1 already holds, C1 would be satisfied as soon as event2 happens. But nothing in the given rules forces or implies that event2 will ever happen. Therefore from the given information we cannot derive that event2 will occur, so we cannot derive that C1 will ever hold.
- Conclusion: C2 is not true (it is not guaranteed / not entailed by the given facts and rules). If you allow external or spontaneous occurrences of event2 beyond the stated rules, C2 could become true, but not based on the provided information.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (i.e. at the start we are in a state after event1).

Step 2 — transition/constraint rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, it forces event1 to occur afterwards).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreted as: in the given scenario/run, event2 occurs (or for all runs, event2 occurs) — in either case C1 asserts that event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" This is a logical disjunction: C2 is true if either C1 is true (event2 occurs) or event3 occurs.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Because the initial state is after event1 and after event1 no other events can happen, neither event2 nor event3 can occur after the start.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen).
- Event3 also does not happen, so the second disjunct is false.
- With both disjuncts false, C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event3 must happen next.
- After event3, event1 must happen next.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next (a nondeterministic choice).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (natural reading: event2 occurs in every future step / in all executions at all needed times; i.e., you cannot avoid event2.)
  - Note: if by “always” you mean only “occurs at least once,” that is a different (weaker) interpretation; I’ll address that below.
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” (both event1 occurs and the statement of C1 is true)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the rules and the initial event2, the forced sequence for the first three steps is: 2 → 3 → 1. So event1 does occur (at least once) in every run.
- After that event1, the system can choose either event2 or event3. Two possible infinite behaviours:
  - Choose event2 after every event1: the cycle 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → …, so event2 occurs repeatedly.
  - Always choose event3 after event1: the cycle 2 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → …, in which no further event2 occurs after the initial one.
- Therefore:
  - If C1 is read as “event2 occurs in every future step / cannot be avoided,” C1 is false (there is a valid run that never returns to event2 after the initial one).
  - If C1 is read weakly as “event2 occurs at least once,” then C1 is true (the initial event2 satisfies that).
- C2 requires both “event1 happens” and the strong C1. Event1 does happen (forced). But under the natural reading of C1 as “always” (i.e., unavoidable), C1 is false, so C2 (the conjunction) is false.
- Even under the weak reading (“event2 occurs at least once”), C2 would be true — but that is not the usual meaning of “always.”

Conclusion
- Under the usual interpretation of “always happens” (unavoidable, holds for all future behaviours), C2 is false. A concrete counterexample run: 2 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → … (here event1 occurs but event2 does not always happen).

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That means C1 is true at all times — equivalent to saying event2 never occurs at any time.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final verdict
- The initial condition already gives a counterexample to C1: event2 did happen initially, so C1 is false.
- Because C1 is false at the start, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (so at the starting point event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (event1 implies next is event2 or event3.)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 implies next is event2.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" — both events occur (at some times).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — i.e. (event1 and event3) OR event1. Logically this simplifies to just ""event1 happens"" because A ∨ (A ∧ B) ≡ A.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1 and event3) can occur after the initial moment.
- Therefore event1 does not happen, and event3 does not happen. Hence C1 is false, and (since C2 ≡ event1 happens) C2 is false.

Final answer: C2 is False.

Note on ambiguity: if one allowed event1 or event3 to have happened before the stated ""initial"" event2, then the information would be incomplete and you could not conclude. Under the usual reading that the given initial state is the start and rules govern subsequent events, C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules?
- From event1 you must next have either event2 or event3 (exclusive choice).
- After event2 no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3 no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (i.e., in the execution being considered, event3 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as universally quantifying over all possible executions/futures: C2 says in every possible execution/event sequence, event3 does not happen.

4) How do these relate and conclusion?
- From the rules there are two possible complete traces starting from the initial condition:
  - event1 → event2
  - event1 → event3
- In the first trace C1 holds (event3 does not happen). In the second trace C1 is false (event3 does happen).
- Because there exists a possible execution in which event3 happens, C1 is not true in all executions. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 must occur event3 (i.e., any occurrence of event1 is eventually followed by an event3).
- After event3 must occur event2 (i.e., any occurrence of event3 is eventually followed by an event2).
- After event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (there exists a time in the future when event1 occurs)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (both event2 occurs at some point and event1 eventually occurs)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the initial event3 and the rule ""after event3 → event2"", event2 must happen eventually. So event2 is guaranteed.
- Nothing in the rules forces event1 to ever happen. It is permitted to occur before event2 (between event3 and the eventual event2), but it is not required.
- Therefore there are two kinds of possible runs:
  - Run A (no event1): initial event3 → (event2 happens) → stop. Here C1 is false, so C2 is false.
  - Run B (event1 occurs before event2): initial event3 → event1 → (event3 required after event1) → event3 → event2 → stop. Here C1 is true and event2 happens, so C2 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed by the premises. It is possible (true in some runs) but not necessarily true in all runs. So C2 is not entailed — you cannot conclude C2 from the given information.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event1, no other events can happen (the sequence ends).
- After event2, event3 must happen next (so event2 is always followed by event3).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (taken literally, this says that event3 never happens.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (a conjunction: event1 occurs AND event3 does not happen.)

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- The initial condition already asserts event3 happened. Therefore the literal C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 requires C1 to be true as part of the conjunction. Since C1 is false, C2 is false regardless of whether event1 occurs.
- (Illustrative sequences allowed by the rules: event3 → event1 (ends); event3 → event2 → event3 → event1 (ends); event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → … → event1, etc. In all cases the initial event3 did happen.)

Conclusion
- Under the literal reading of C1 given the stated initial condition, C2 is False.

Note on possible ambiguity: if C1 were intended to mean ""no further event3 occurs after the initial one,"" then after the initial event3 you could choose event1 next, and no further event3 would occur — in that alternate reading C1 would be true and C2 would be true for the sequence event3 → event1. But as written (with the explicit initial event3), the literal C1 is false and so C2 is false.

False

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the first/initial step of the trace is event2).
- Also: after event2 no other events can happen (so the trace stops producing events after that point).

2) Transition rules
- After event2: no further events may occur.
- After event1: the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- After event3: the next event must be either event1 or event2.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is ambiguous without a temporal reading. Two natural readings:
  - C1a (global/always): event2 never occurs at any time in the trace.
  - C1b (local/at-a-time): at a particular moment t, ""event2 does not happen (now).""
  - C1c (eventually-always): from some time onward, event2 never occurs (i.e., ""eventually, always not event2"").
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means there exists a time in the future at which the proposition C1 is true. How this is evaluated depends on which reading of C1 we use:
  - If C1 = C1a (global/always): C2 would claim ""eventually the trace will be such that event2 never occurs"" — but a global property about the whole trace is not something that can become true later if it is already violated by the initial prefix.
  - If C1 = C1b (local): C2 says ""there exists a future time at which event2 is not happening (at that instant).""
  - If C1 = C1c (eventually-always): C2 says ""there exists a time after which event2 never occurs.""

4) Relating them and answering whether C2 is true
- From the scenario: event2 happens initially, and then no further events ever happen. So:
  - C1a (event2 never occurs) is false (it did occur initially).
  - C1b (at a time, event2 is not happening): true at any time strictly after the initial event2, because no events occur then, so ""event2 is not happening (now)"" holds at those times. Therefore there exists a future time where C1b holds, so C2 (under this reading) is true.
  - C1c (eventually-always not event2): also true, because immediately after the initial event2 the system produces no further events, so from that point onward event2 never occurs again. Thus there is a point after which event2 never occurs, so C2 (under this reading) is true.

Conclusion (concise)
- If C1 is intended to mean ""event2 never occurs at any time"" (global/always), then C1 is false and C2 is false (you cannot later make that global property true because it was already violated initially).
- If C1 is intended in the usual temporal senses (either ""at some moment, event2 is not happening"" or ""event2 eventually stops happening forever""), then C2 is true. Given the problem statement (""Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen.""), the most useful/readable interpretation is the latter, so C2 is True.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at least once, at the start).

2) Transition rules:
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, event2 must happen next.

These define allowed sequences such as:
- 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ...
- 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ...
- 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ...

3) What each condition means:
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (i.e. no occurrence of event1)
- C2: “Event3 happens and C1 holds.” (both: event3 occurs at least once, and event1 never occurs)

4) How they relate and final evaluation:
- C1 is false because the initial fact explicitly says event1 happened. That contradicts “event1 does not happen.”
- C2 requires C1 to be true; since C1 is false, C2 is false as well — regardless of whether event3 occurs later.

(As a note: event3 may or may not occur depending on choices after event2, but that doesn’t rescue C2 because C1 already fails due to the initial event1.)

- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1: either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2: event1 must happen.

(“After event2, event1 must happen.” was repeated, which is the same rule.)

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” — i.e., event2 never occurs in the run.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — i.e., the negation of C1, so event2 does happen at some point.

Step 4 — how they relate / truth of C2
- Starting from event3, one allowed run is: event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... alternating indefinitely between event1 and event3. Each step respects the rules:
  - After event3 we chose event1 (allowed),
  - After event1 we chose event3 (allowed).
- In that run event2 never occurs, so C1 can be true.
- Since C1 can be true, C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold) is not guaranteed. In particular, C2 is false in the run above.

Conclusion: C2 is false (not entailed by the rules). Note: some other runs can make event2 happen, so C2 is not impossible — but it is not necessarily true.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (event2 → (event1 ∨ event3)).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" (event1 ∧ event3).
  Given the initial condition, event1 is true; C1 requires that event3 also occurs at some point.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" (event3 ∨ C1).
  Logically this simplifies: event3 ∨ (event1 ∧ event3) ≡ event3. So C2 is equivalent to ""event3 happens.""

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 implies C2 (if event1 ∧ event3, then event3, so C2 holds).
- C2 does not imply C1 (C2/event3 can hold without event1 also holding, although here event1 does hold initially).
- Crucially, event3 is allowed but not forced by the rules: after event2 you may choose event1 (leading to another event2 later) or choose event3 (which ends the run). Thus event3 is possible but not guaranteed.

Final answer about C2:
- C2 is not guaranteed (not necessarily true). It is satisfiable (there are executions where C2 is true, e.g. event1 → event2 → event3) and there are executions where it is false (e.g. an execution that loops event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... and never takes the event3 branch). So the truth of C2 is contingent on the choices after event2.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred (it is the starting event).

2) Transition rules
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur (event3 → event1).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event2 → event1).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can occur (event1 is terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" (So C2 asserts both event3 happens and event3 does not happen.)

4) How they relate / logical consequence
- From the initial condition (event2) and the rule (after event2 → event1), event1 must occur.
- Because event1 is terminal, no further events can occur after it; thus event3 cannot occur later.
- Given the timeline (event2 then event1), there is no place for event3 to occur. Therefore C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 asserts both event3 happens and event3 does not happen simultaneously, which is contradictory. Therefore C2 is false.

Conclusion: C1 is true; C2 is false. (Unless you allow event3 to occur before the initial event2 or allow simultaneous/nonsequenced occurrences — under the usual sequential interpretation above, C2 is impossible.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 occurs, there are no subsequent events.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, a later event1 must occur.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (If event3 occurs, then later event1 or event2 must occur.)

Step 3 — what C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens"" = (event2 OR event3).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" = event2 AND (event2 OR event3). Logically this simplifies to just event2 (A ∧ (A ∨ B) ≡ A).

Step 4 — combine rules and evaluate
- Since event1 already happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, neither event2 nor event3 can occur at any later time. Therefore event2 is false and event3 is false.
- C1 = (event2 OR event3) is false.
- C2 simplifies to event2, which is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If you instead allow events to have occurred before the stated initial moment — e.g., event2 happened earlier and then event1 happened initially to satisfy the “after event2, event1 must happen” rule — the result could differ. Under the plain reading given, where event1 happens initially and blocks any later events, C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

C2 simplifies to ""event2"", and because event1 has already happened and prevents any later events, event2 cannot occur — so C2 is false."

Step-by-step.

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event1: event2 must happen next.
- After event3: either event1 or event2 must happen next.

(These are nondeterministic choices where ""either ... or ..."" means one of them must be chosen, but the choice need not be unique or fixed.)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" That means there exists some time at/after the current point when event3 occurs. (If you treat ""eventually"" as allowing the current/initial occurrence, the initial event3 already satisfies C1. If you treat ""eventually"" as strictly sometime after the initial moment, then C1 requires a future occurrence of event3.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires both that event1 occurs at some point and that event3 occurs (as required by your interpretation of C1).

4) How the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- C1: If ""eventually"" includes the initial moment, C1 is immediately true because event3 has already happened. If ""eventually"" means strictly in the future, C1 is not guaranteed (see below).
- C2: Not guaranteed (i.e., not necessarily true). The rules allow traces that never include event1, so the conjunct ""event1 happens"" can fail.

Counterexample trace showing C2 can be false:
- Start (initial) event3.
- From event3 choose event2.
- From event2 choose event3.
- Repeat: event3, event2, event3, event2, ...
This infinite trace contains no event1, so C2 is false on that trace. If ""eventually"" includes the initial event3, C1 is true on that trace but C2 is still false because event1 never occurs.

There are also traces where C2 is true (e.g., initial event3 → event1 → event2 → event3 ...), so C2 is possible but not guaranteed. 

Summary answer: C2 is not necessarily true (it is satisfiable but not entailed by the rules).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: There are valid traces (e.g., initial event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ...) that never include event1. Such a trace satisfies C1 (if the initial event3 counts) but violates ""event1 happens,"" so C2 is not guaranteed. C2 is satisfiable in some traces but not universally true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (E1), event2 (E2), event3 (E3).
- Initial condition: E3 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (what must happen after each event)
- After E3, E1 must happen.
- After E1, either E2 or E3 must happen (one of them; choice not determined).
- After E2, E1 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the given conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens"" — a logical OR: C1 is true if at least one of E3 or E1 occurs.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — both (a) E2 happens at some point and (b) C1 is true.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation of C2
- Because E3 has already happened initially, C1 is true (the E3 part of the OR holds).
- Whether E2 happens is not forced by the rules: after E1 the system must produce either E2 or E3, so E2 is possible but not guaranteed (the choice could always pick E3 instead).
- Therefore C2 (E2 happens and C1 holds) is not entailed by the rules. It is:
  - True in some possible event sequences (e.g., E3 → E1 → E2 → ...), and
  - False in other possible sequences (e.g., E3 → E1 → E3 → E1 → ... with E2 never occurring).

Conclusion
- C1: True (because E3 already occurred).
- C2: Undetermined/Not provably true given the rules. It may be true in some runs and false in others, so you cannot conclude C2 is necessarily true.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., the starting state includes event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (so at least one of those occurs next).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Because event1 and event3 are terminal, they cannot both occur after event2. So from the initial event2 there are exactly two possible continuations: event2 → event1, or event2 → event3.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p). It is always true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 always holds, C2 is true exactly when event1 happens.

4) How do these conditions relate and what's the truth of C2?
- From the rules, event1 is not guaranteed: after event2 the system may choose event1 or event3. So there are two possible scenarios:
  - Scenario A: event2 → event1. Then C2 is true.
  - Scenario B: event2 → event3. Then C2 is false.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the given information. C1 is true; C2 is contingent (possible in some runs, false in others). If you ask whether C2 is guaranteed (logically true) given the context: no, it is not.

Short answer: C1 is True. C2 is not necessarily True (so, not provable from the premises).

False

Reason: C1 is a tautology and holds, but C2 requires event1 to happen. From event2 either event1 or event3 may occur, so event1 is not guaranteed; thus C2 is not guaranteed (not necessarily true)."

3. Meaning of the conditions

4. How they relate
- Because event1 happened initially and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes any later event impossible, event3 cannot occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is true.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event1 has happened (at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

(These are obligations: whenever one of those events occurs, the stated next event(s) must occur at the corresponding next step(s).)

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (i.e., at some time now or in the future.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event1 never happens at any time.)

4) How they relate / reasoning
- Event1 has already happened initially, so C1 is already satisfied immediately. Even if one interprets ""eventually"" as strictly in the future, the transition rules ensure event1 will occur again: after event1 we must see event2; after that we must see either event1 or event3; if event3 occurs, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" forces event1 next—so in every possible continuation event1 will occur again. Thus in all interpretations C1 is true.

Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., the current/initial state is one where event2 has just occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- R1: After event3, event2 must happen (if event3 happens, the next state must have event2).
- R2: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: no events occur after it).
- R3: After event1, event3 must happen (if event1 happens, the next state must have event3).

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately following the initial state).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., either event1 happens in that situation, or event3 happens in the next state).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the initial condition and R2: because event2 happened initially and R2 says no other events can happen after event2, there can be no events in the next state. 
- Therefore C1 (event3 in the next state) is false.
- Also event1 cannot happen (no events can occur after event2), so the ""event1 happens"" disjunct of C2 is false as well.
- Hence C2 = (event1) OR (C1) is false OR false, which is False.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so the system starts immediately after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event3 must happen (i.e. event3 is required next).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" Interpreted as the proposition that event3 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as C1 being true in all executions / at all times (i.e. event3 never occurs in any execution).

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- Because the system starts with event1 and the rule says ""after event1, event3 must happen"", event3 will (indeed must) occur in the execution that starts from the given initial condition (trace: event1 → event3).
- Therefore C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false in that execution.
- Since C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e. event3 never happens in any execution/time), and we have a valid execution where event3 does happen, C2 is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: the system starts with event1 and the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces the trace event1 → event3, so C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false in that execution. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next (and then that next event is terminal).

Given the initial condition (event2 happened), the only possible trace from the start is: [event2] and then termination.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting this in the model: in the actual run(s) of the system, event1 occurs (in all relevant runs or at least in the current run, depending on intended reading). Under the given initial condition, event1 does not occur, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This is a simple disjunction: either event1 occurs, or the statement C1 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- In the actual scenario (initial event2, terminal), event1 does not happen, so the first disjunct is false.
- We already saw C1 is false, so the second disjunct is false.
- False OR False = False.

- After event1, event3 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 is followed by an occurrence of event3).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" This means at least one of event1 or event2 occurs (at some point). Because event1 has already happened initially, C1 is satisfied.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1 (i.e., neither event1 nor event2 happens).

4) How they relate / conclusion
- Since the initial condition already gives that event1 happens, C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Extra note: the transition rules force an alternating occurrence of event1 and event3 after the initial event1 (event1 → event3 → event1 → …), so event2 is unnecessary to satisfy C1.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 already happened (it holds at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (the system will take one of those two branches).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens."" Given event2 already happened initially, C1 is equivalent to ""event3 happens at some point (and event2 did happen earlier).""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means: at some (possibly later) time we reach a state where both event2 and event3 have happened — equivalently, event3 happens sometime after the initial event2.

(You mentioned C3 but none was defined; only C1 and C2 are present.)

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- From the rules, after the initial event2 the system must choose either event1 or event3. Because event1 and event3 are terminal, both cannot happen after event2; the choice is exclusive in effect.
- Therefore there are two possible executions:
  a) event2 → event1 (then stops). Here event3 never happens → C1 is false.
  b) event2 → event3 (then stops). Here event3 happens → C1 true.
- Since an execution exists (case a) where C1 never holds, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is not guaranteed by the given rules. C2 is not necessarily true; it is possible in some runs but not true in all runs.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed (i.e., false as a necessary consequence).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: After the initial event2 the system must choose either event1 or event3, and both are terminal. So some executions are event2→event1 (no event3) and some are event2→event3. Since there exists a run where event3 never happens, ""C1 eventually holds"" is not guaranteed."

- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (that is the starting fact).

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen (event1 ⇒ next is event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (event3 ⇒ next is event1 or event2).

- Because event2 happened initially and the rule says that after event2 no other events can happen, no further events can occur. Therefore event3 does not happen.
- Since event3 does not happen, C1 is false.
- C2 requires event3 to happen (plus event1), so C2 is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If one allowed events to occur before the “initial” event2, or to occur simultaneously with it, the answer could differ; with the plain reading “initially event2 happened” and “after event2 no other events can happen,” C2 is false.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules (given)
- After event3 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. event3 → later event1).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 occurs, either event1 or event3 must occur next (event2 → (event1 or event3)).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1: “Event2 happens and event3 happens” — both event2 and event3 occur at some times in the execution.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — C1 is true in all (every) possible execution given the initial condition and rules (i.e. it is guaranteed).

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- Because event1 already happened initially and “after event1 no other events can happen,” no further events (including event2 or event3) can occur after the start.
- Therefore event2 and event3 cannot happen at any time in any run starting from the given initial state. So C1 is false.
- Since C1 is not true even in the actual run, it cannot be true in all runs; hence C2 (that C1 always holds) is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

- Therefore event1 is false and event2 is false. Hence C1 (event1 and event2) is false.
- Algebraically C2 = event1 OR (event1 AND event2) which simplifies to event1. Since event1 is false, C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start with event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (one of them).
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” (i.e., event1 never occurs).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — equivalently, event1 does happen at least once.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate; is C2 true or false?
- The rules do not force event1 to ever occur. From the initial event2 you may choose event3 next and then must go back to event2, then again choose event3, etc. Example satisfying C1 (event1 never occurs):
  event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... (no event1)
- The rules also allow event1 to occur. Example satisfying C2 (event1 does occur):
  event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
- Therefore C1 is possible but not forced, and C2 is possible but not forced. The truth of C2 is not determined by the given rules alone — it can be True in some executions and False in others.

Short answer to ""C2 is True or False?"": Undetermined (both are possible); C2 is not entailed by the rules.

False

Reason: From the initial event2 you can repeatedly choose event3 (event2 → event3 → event2 → …) and never produce event1, so ""event1 does happen"" (C2) is not guaranteed by the rules."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: in the current (initial) state event2 happened. (So in the current state event3 did NOT happen.)

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1, event3 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen in the next state.
Thus the next-state event is non-deterministically chosen subject to those constraints.

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (a proposition about the next state)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" We must clarify the second disjunct: most naturally it means ""event3 happens in the current state."" If instead it meant ""event3 happens in the next state"" then C2 would be just (C1 or C1) = C1, i.e. redundant. So take the natural reading: C2 = (event3 happens next) OR (event3 happens now).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- In the current state event2 happened, so ""event3 happens now"" is false.
- From the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next,"" the next state could be event3 or could be event1. Therefore C1 (event3 next) is not forced true; it may be true or false depending on the choice.
- Since the current-event3 disjunct is false, C2 reduces to C1. Because C1 is not determined by the rules, C2 is likewise not determined.

Conclusion
- C2 is undetermined/contingent: it can be true on runs where the next state is event3, and false on runs where the next state is event1. From the given information you cannot conclude C2 is always true (nor always false).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: currently event2 happened (so ""event3 now"" is false). After event2 the next state may be event1 or event3. Thus C2 = (event3 next) OR (event3 now) reduces to ""event3 next"", which is not forced — it can be false if the next state is event1. Hence C2 is not guaranteed true (and indeed can be false)."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen: event2 ⇒ event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen: event1 ⇒ event2.
- After event3, event1 must happen: event3 ⇒ event1.

From the first two rules we get event1 ⇔ event2 (each implies the other). The rule about event3 is irrelevant unless event3 occurs.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens = event1 ∧ event2.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens = (event1 ∧ event2) ∧ event2, which is logically equivalent to event1 ∧ event2 (C2 is just C1 with a redundant conjunct).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value
- Start: event1 is true.
- By event1 ⇒ event2, event2 must occur, so event2 is true.
- Therefore event1 ∧ event2 is true, so C1 is true.
- Because C2 is equivalent to C1 (redundant extra event2), C2 is also true.

- After event2 occurs, either event1 or event3 must occur next.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Logically: C1 ≡ (event2 ∨ event1). Given the plain reading, this asserts that at least one of event2 or event1 occurs (and is true if either has occurred).

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has already happened (i.e., at the current/initial time event3 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, event3 must occur (so event2 ⇒ later event3).
- After event3 occurs, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal; it blocks any further events).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — there exists some future (from now) time at which event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some future time, the statement C1 will be true (i.e., there will be a future point from which we can say that event2 will eventually occur).

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Because event3 has already happened and ""after event3 no other events can happen,"" no new occurrences of event1 or event2 can occur at any time from now on.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false now and will remain false (there is no future time at which event2 occurs).
- Since C1 is never true at any future point, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event3 has already happened and is terminal (no further events can occur), so event2 will never occur (C1 false now and forever), hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false."

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event3 happened (call that time t0).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Interpreting ""after X, Y must happen"" as the next required event, the rules force alternation 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → … forever. event1 is never triggered by these rules and so does not occur.

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (Most natural reading: event2 occurs at every step/time or in every state.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" That is, event2 occurs at least once AND event2 occurs always.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Does event2 happen at least once? Yes: from the initial event3 we must have event2 next (so event2 does occur, in fact infinitely often).
- Does C1 hold (event2 always happens at every step)? No: the sequence contains times when event3 occurs (t0, t2, …), so event2 is not happening at those times. Therefore C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (which requires both ""event2 happens"" and C1) is false because C1 fails.

(If you intended a different semantics of ""always"" — e.g. “event2 eventually happens after every occurrence of something” — say so and I can re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: Although event2 does occur (indeed repeatedly) in the forced alternation 3→2→3→2→…, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because there are times when event3 occurs instead. C2 requires both that event2 happens and that C1 holds, so C2 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (so we start in a state after event3).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e. the next/next-in-future event(s) include event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards.

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — from the current (initial) state, at some future point event1 will occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state (the state after the initial one), it is true that event1 will eventually happen.

(There were no other C3, etc., given.)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the initial state we know event3 has happened, so by the first rule event2 must happen next.
- Once event2 happens, the second rule makes the system terminal: no further events can occur after event2.
- Therefore event1 cannot occur at any future point (neither now nor after the next state). So C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false in the initial state and remains false in the next state (which is the state after event3, i.e. the event2 state), C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false.

- The rules do not force one specific choice between event1 and event2 after event3; both outcomes are allowed.

Short answer: C2 is not true (it cannot be concluded). Now the step-by-step breakdown.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happened initially (so event3 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event3 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, a later event3 must occur).
- After event3, event1 must happen (whenever event3 occurs, a later event1 must occur).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, a later event3 must occur).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (i.e., event3 never occurs.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e., either event2 occurs at some point, or event3 never occurs.)
- (No C3 was given.)

4) How these conditions relate and conclusion
- The initial fact says event3 did happen. That immediately contradicts C1, so C1 is false.
- Given the rules, since event3 happened initially, event1 must happen afterward; then after that event1, event3 must happen again, and so on. So event3 does occur (indeed it already did), confirming C1 is false.
- C2 is the disjunction (event2 happens) OR (C1). With C1 false, C2 reduces to ""event2 happens"".
- The context gives no rule or fact forcing event2 to occur, so event2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is not entailed by the given information.

So: C2 cannot be concluded true from the context. (It could be true in some possible scenario if event2 happens, but it is not necessarily/necessarily true given the premises.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must occur next.
- After event2, event1 must occur next.
- After event3, event2 must occur next.

So allowed infinite traces include:
- 1,2,1,2,1,2,... (if after each 1 we pick 2)
- 1,3,2,1,3,2,1,3,2,... (if after some 1 we pick 3, which forces 2 next, then 1, ...)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just a redundant expression that simplifies to ""Event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 is true in the current state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — interpreted naturally, this says ""event2 holds in every state (globally/always).""

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- C1 is simply the proposition ""event2"".
- C2 asserts that event2 is always true (invariant).
- C2 is false. Counterexample: the initial state has event1 true and event2 false, so C1 is false there, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") fails immediately. More generally, in all valid traces there are states where event1 holds and event2 does not hold simultaneously, so event2 is not true in every state.

(For extra clarity: although event2 is not true in every state, the rules do guarantee event2 will occur repeatedly — from any event1 you get event2 either immediately or after one step via event3 — so ""event2 eventually occurs repeatedly"" is true, but the stronger statement ""event2 is always true"" is false.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened (i.e., we start in a state where event3 already occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event2 happens, then event3 must happen afterwards.
- After event3 happens, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal).

Step 3 — what the conditions C1 and C2 mean
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as: in every possible execution/timeline, event1 occurs (at some point).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: the statement C1 is true in every possible execution — equivalently, C1 is true (i.e., event1 always happens).

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth value of C2
- Because we start with event3 having happened and ""after event3 no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event1) can occur in any execution that respects the rules.
- Therefore there exists a valid execution (indeed the initial one) in which event1 does not happen. That makes C1 false.
- Since C1 is false, the claim ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

(If one allowed simultaneous/co-occurring events at the initial moment, one could imagine event1 and event3 both having occurred initially; under the usual sequential semantics assumed here, simultaneous occurrence is not allowed and the conclusion above holds.)

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen (i.e. event3 -> next is event1).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (event1 -> next is event2 or event3).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 -> next is event3).

These give the allowed one-step transitions:
- event2 → event3
- event3 → event1
- event1 → event2  or  event1 → event3

3) Meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" in the usual temporal sense: from every time point in the future, the current event is event2 (i.e. globally/eventually-for-all-time: G(event2)).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting as: at some future time point, C1 becomes true and then holds forever (i.e. F G(event2)).

(If you intended different semantics for ""always"" or ""eventually,"" say so and I will adapt the analysis.)

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- From the rule event2 → event3, every occurrence of event2 must be immediately followed by event3. Thus it is impossible that from some point onward every state is event2 (because any event2 forces the next state to be event3). In other words, G(event2) can never become true at any future point.
- Therefore F G(event2) (C2) is false.

Extra remark (optional): There are infinite traces where event2 occurs infinitely often (for example: event2, event3, event1, event2, event3, event1, ... by always choosing event2 after event1), but that is weaker than C2. C2 requires that eventually event2 holds at every future step, which is impossible because event2 must always be followed by event3.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 → event3, so any occurrence of event2 is immediately followed by event3; therefore G(event2) can never become true at any future point, so F G(event2) (C2) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 happens (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event2 → event1).
- After event1 occurs, either event2 or event3 must occur (event1 → (event2 or event3)).
- After event3 occurs, event2 must occur (event3 → event2).

Step 3 — what the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens."" (There exists at least one occurrence of event3 and at least one occurrence of event2.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" This can be read two ways:
  a) Weak reading: C2 simply repeats that event3 and event2 happen (so it is equivalent to C1).
  b) Strong reading: C2 requires C1 to have held and then (additionally) event3 to occur again after that — i.e., an extra occurrence of event3 beyond the one used in C1.

Step 4 — how the rules determine the conditions
- From the initial event3, by the rule after event3 → event2, event2 must happen next. So both event3 and event2 do in fact occur. Therefore C1 is true (entailed by the rules and initial condition).
- Continuing: after that event2 → event1 must happen, and after that event1 → either event2 or event3. At that choice point you may get event3 again or you may get event2 again; both are allowed by the rules.

Conclusion about C2
- Under the weak reading (C2 just restates that event3 and event2 happen): C2 is true (it follows from the initial event3 and the rules).
- Under the strong reading (C2 requires an additional event3 after C1): C2 is not guaranteed — it is possible but not forced. The system may choose event2 after event1 and never produce another event3, so C2 would not necessarily hold.

Final answer: C2 is not necessarily true in every run (unless you mean the weak reading, in which case it is true).

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initially: event3 has happened (this is the starting/initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event3, no other events can happen (i.e. no events occur at any time strictly after event3).
- After event1, event3 must happen (if event1 occurs, event3 follows).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 occurs, that blocks any later events).

3) What C1 and C2 mean
- C1 = ""event1 happens AND event2 happens"" (both occur).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (there will be some point in time — now or later — at which both event1 and event2 have happened).

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Since initially event3 has happened and the rule “after event3 no other events can happen” forbids any events after that point, neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any future time.
- Under the usual reading that the initial state is the earliest moment (i.e. event1 and event2 did not already happen earlier), C1 cannot become true, so C2 (that C1 eventually holds) is false.

(If one allowed the nonstandard interpretation that events could have occurred before the initial state or that multiple events occurred simultaneously at initial time, the conclusion might differ; under the normal interpretation above, C2 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event3 has already happened and the rule ""after event3 no other events can happen"" prevents event1 and event2 from occurring later, so C1 (event1 and event2) cannot ever hold."

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (i.e., the system starts with an occurrence of event2).

2) Transition rules between events (as given):
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (Whenever event3 occurs, event1 follows.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted formally: event2 → (eventually) event1 — any occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as a global/invariant claim: in every possible execution (trace) of the system, C1 is true (i.e., the implication from event2 to event1 holds universally).

4) How they relate and answer whether C2 is true:
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" directly expresses the same implication as C1. That rule enforces the implication for every occurrence of event2.
- Therefore C1 is entailed by the system rules.
- Because the rule is a general rule about what must follow event2 (not just a one-off for the initial event2), C1 holds in every possible execution; hence C2 (the claim that C1 always holds) is true.

(If one read the specification in a different, very weak way — e.g., ""after event2, event1 must happen"" applied only to that specific initial occurrence and not to any other potential occurrence — the other rules still prevent a later event2 from happening after event1 (event1 is terminal), so there is no counterexample trace.

2) Transition rules

- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

3) What the conditions mean

- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (i.e., event2 occurs and event1 occurs).

4) How the conditions relate (deduction)
- Because event3 happened initially and no events may occur after event3, there is no opportunity for event1 or event2 to occur later. Therefore event1 does not happen in this run → C1 is false.
- C2 requires both event2 and C1. Event2 does not happen (and C1 is false), so C2 is false.

Answer: C2 is False (not guaranteed).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (next state).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (next state).
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" — there exists some future state (possibly the current one) where event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — starting from the next state, event1 will eventually happen (i.e., in every continuation from the next state there is some future state with event1).

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- C1 is true now because event1 already happened initially.
- C2 is not guaranteed. From the next state we must have event2 (because event1 occurred initially). After that event2, the system may choose event3 and then terminate, in which case event1 never happens again. Example trace: t0: event1 (initial), t1: event2 (forced), t2: event3 (allowed), end — here C1 is true at t0 but false at t1. Thus C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is false in general. (It would be true in some traces where event2 is followed by event1, but not in all.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Counterexample: t0: event1 (initial). Then t1 must be event2. From t1 the system may choose event3 next, giving t2: event3 and termination. At t1 there is no future event1, so C1 does not hold at the next state. Thus C2 is not guaranteed."

- Events: event1, event2, event3.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., C1 is true in all possible executions of the system.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the initial condition and rules, the forced execution is: event2 → event3 (since we start with event2, after event2 event3 must occur, and after event3 the trace ends).
- That trace contains event3 but does not contain event1. Therefore C1 is false (there is a counterexample).
- Because C1 can be falsified by a valid trace, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

If you meant a different temporal interpretation of C1 (for example ""whenever event3 occurs, event1 happened earlier""), the same counterexample applies: event3 can occur without any prior event1. Thus C2 is still false.

Answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 is followed by event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Given the initial event2 and the rules, the only possible execution sequence is: event2 -> event3, and then stop.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreted as: in the execution(s) under consideration, event1 occurs (here intended as a universal claim that event1 occurs in the actual run(s)).
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" A logical OR: C2 is true if either event3 happens (in the execution) or C1 is true (or both).

(There is no C3 given.)

4) How the conditions relate
- From the rules and the initial condition, event3 must occur (because event2 happened initially and after event2 event3 must happen).
- Therefore the left disjunct of C2 (""event3 happens"") is true.
- C1 is false: event1 never occurs in the only possible execution (it cannot occur before the initial event2, and it cannot occur after event2 because event2 forces event3).
- Since C2 is an OR and one disjunct (event3 happens) is true, C2 is true overall.

Conclusion: C1 is false; C2 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we start in a state immediately after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next (non‑deterministic choice).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (I.e., from the current state the immediate next event is event2.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (I.e., there exists some future state at which the immediate next event is event2.)

Step 4 — how they relate and conclusion
- From the initial state (after event1) the next event must be either event2 or event3.
  - If the choice is event2, then C1 is true immediately and hence C2 is true.
  - If the choice is event3, the system terminates and no further events occur; C1 is false at the start and can never become true, so C2 is false on that run.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context. It is satisfiable (there are runs where C2 holds) but not valid (there are runs where it fails).

Final answer: C2 is not necessarily true (i.e., it can be false).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the initial state (after event1) the system may choose event3 next, which is terminal—no future state ever has event2 as the next event. Thus ""eventually C1"" can fail (though it is satisfiable on other runs), so C2 is not guaranteed."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. if event1 occurs, then at some later point event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (they force an alternation).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions

- C2: “C1 does not hold” — the negation of C1; i.e. event2 never happens.

- Since event1 already happened initially and the rule says “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 must occur. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at the initial state, event2 happened (event2 holds at time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event3, event2 must happen."" (Interpretation used here: whenever event3 occurs at some state, event2 must hold in the following state.)
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred, there are no further events in any subsequent state — the run ends or no new events occur thereafter.)
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Same kind of terminal condition if event1 occurs.)

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" This asserts that event3 holds at every state (globally / at all times).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the immediate successor state (the next state after the current one), C1 is true (i.e., from that successor state onward, event3 always holds).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C2?
- At the initial state event2 holds. By the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" there cannot be any further events after the initial state (no future occurrence of event3).
- C1 (""event3 always happens"") is already false at the initial state: event3 does not hold at time 0 (we know event2 holds instead), and furthermore no future event3 can occur because event2 blocks further events. So C1 is false.
- C2 claims that C1 holds in the next state. Under the usual interpretation, since event2 forbids any further events, there is no state in which event3 holds always; whether because there is no successor state or because the successor has no event3, C1 does not hold at the successor. Therefore C2 is false.

(If one adopts a nonstandard semantics where a nonexistent successor makes ""next"" undefined rather than false, the intended evaluation here still yields C2 does not hold. Under standard linear-time semantics, X φ is false in a final state, so C2 is false.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so from 3 you must go to 1 or 2).
- After event2, event3 must happen (2 → 3).
- After event1, no other events can happen (1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting “always” as a claim about all allowed executions (i.e., in every possible run there is at least one occurrence of event2).  
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is the disjunction: either (this run contains an occurrence of event2) OR (C1 is true as a universal claim).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- Possible executions starting from the initial event3:
  - Choose event1 next: sequence 3 → 1 and then stop. This execution contains no event2.
  - Or choose event2 next: 3 → 2 → 3 → … ; each time you hit 3 you again must choose 1 or 2, so you can get finite runs that end with 1 after some number of (2→3) cycles, or an infinite run that never chooses 1 and alternates 2↔3 forever.
- From the first possible execution (3 → 1), event2 never occurs. Therefore C1 (""event2 happens in every run"") is false.
- C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds""):
  - As a claim that must hold in every run, C2 is not guaranteed: the run 3 → 1 makes both disjuncts false (no event2 occurs in that run, and C1 is false), so C2 is false as a universal/entailed statement.
  - As a per-run statement, C2 is true in any run that contains event2, and false in runs that do not contain event2 (because C1 is false).

Final answer to your direct question
- C2 is not true as a universally guaranteed claim (it is not entailed by the rules). It is true in runs where event2 occurs, and false in runs (e.g. 3 → 1) where event2 never occurs.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at the current state (call it s0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after any state where event2 happened must contain event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — no future events after a state containing event1).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state” = at s1 (the immediate successor of the current state) event3 holds.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” = at s1 the formula C1 is true, i.e. event3 holds at s2 (two steps ahead). So C2 ≡ “event3 holds two steps from now.”

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From s0 we know event2 happened, so by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” the next state s1 must have event1.
- Therefore C1 (event3 at s1) is false because s1 has event1, not event3.
- Moreover, because “after event1 no other events can happen,” there can be no event at s2. Thus event3 cannot occur at s2, so C2 (event3 at s2) is also false.

Answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, the system stops — no further events ever occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

(Each rule says that once that event has occurred, there are no further transitions.)

3) What do C1 and C2 mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — i.e. at some future time event2 occurs (LTL: F event2).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. at every point (in every reachable state) it is true that event2 will eventually happen (LTL: G F event2).

4) How do these conditions relate?
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule “after event1 no other events can happen” prevents any further events, there is no possible future in which event2 can occur. Therefore C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false in the given model.
- Since C1 is false, the statement “C1 always holds” (C2) is also false.

Optional note: under any reasonable reading of “after event1 no other events can happen” (meaning no further events at all after event1), there is no way for event2 to occur later, so C1 and hence C2 are both false.

Short answer: C2 is false.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: initially event3 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen (event1 → event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a trivial tautology (p → p). C1 is true in every circumstance where the implication is evaluated.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally C2 = (C1 → event1). Since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to simply event1.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the initial condition and the terminal rule for event3: event3 already happened initially, and because after event3 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1 or event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore event1 does not happen in this scenario.
- Since C2 is equivalent to event1 (because C1 is true), C2 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next. (From event2 → {event1, event3}.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next. (From event1 → {event2, event3}.)
- After event3, event2 must happen next. (From event3 → {event2}.)

You can view this as a directed graph of possible next events.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: “Event3 always happens.” Interpreted naturally, this means event3 is inevitable (in every possible execution/trace it will occur at some point or infinitely often depending on intended meaning). In either reading, C1 asserts that event3 must occur in every allowed behaviour.
- C2: “C1 holds and event3 happens.” This is the conjunction: (C1 is true) AND (event3 happens).

Step 4 — how the rules relate to the conditions and the answer
- From the rules there is a valid infinite behaviour that never contains event3: always choose the branch event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … . This respects all rules (after event2 pick event1; after event1 pick event2), and event3 never occurs.
- Because such a behaviour exists, event3 is not inevitable: C1 is false.
- C2 requires C1 to be true. Since C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false as well (even if there exist some traces where event3 does occur, C2 asserts that event3 must occur in all behaviours, so it still fails).

Conclusion
- C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds and event3 happens) is false.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start (so event1 is true in the initial state).

2) Transition rules (interpreting ""after X"" as the next-step requirement)
- After event1, event2 must happen (every occurrence of event1 is immediately followed by event2).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, event1 must happen next.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — the proposition ¬event1 (no occurrence of event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., ¬event1 holds at every time (event1 never occurs at any time).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- The initial state already has event1 true, so C1 (¬event1) is false right away. Therefore C2, which asserts that C1 holds always, is also false.
- (Stronger observation) The transition rules force event1 to reoccur: e1 → e2 → (e1 or e3) and e3 → e1, so any trace starting from the initial e1 will include e1 repeatedly. That makes C1 impossible and C2 false in all models consistent with the rules.

Therefore C2 is False.

Short answer: C2 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events involved: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 → event3 must happen. (event1 ⇒ event3)
- After event3 → event2 must happen. (event3 ⇒ event2)
- After event2 → event3 must happen. (event2 ⇒ event3)

Note the last two rules create a cycle: event2 forces event3, and event3 forces event2, so once either occurs they force each other (an alternation).

3) What the conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Interpreted as a global claim that event2 never happens.
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true iff (event3 happens) AND (event2 never happens).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- The initial fact ""event2 happened"" immediately falsifies C1 (it claims event2 never happens).
- From the rule event2 ⇒ event3, since event2 did happen, event3 must happen.
- So event3 does happen, but C1 is false, so the conjunction in C2 (event3 AND C1) is false.

Therefore C2 is false. (Even though event3 does occur, C1 is false because event2 did occur.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event3 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event3, event2 must happen (so the next step after 3 is 2).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so the next step after 2 is 3).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so the next step after 1 is 3).
From these rules you get deterministic behavior once a current event is known. Starting from the initial event3, the forced sequence is: 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, ... (event1 never occurs in that trace).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" (This is ambiguous without a temporal operator: it can mean (A) “in the current state, event1 ∨ event2 holds” or (B) “event1 ∨ event2 will happen at some time (eventually).”)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Likewise ambiguous: typically this means (G C1) “at every time point C1 holds” (global/always). If C1 were read as “eventually (event1 or event2)”, C2 could mean “at every time point it is true that eventually (event1 or event2) happens” (i.e. G F (event1 ∨ event2)).

4) How do these conditions relate and is C2 true or false?
- Under the usual state-wise reading (C1 means ""now event1 or event2""): at time 0 we have event3, so C1 is false at time 0 (neither event1 nor event2 holds). Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false — a concrete counterexample is the initial state event3.
- If instead C1 was intended as ""eventually event1 or event2 (in the future)"" and C2 as ""always eventually (event1 or event2)"" (i.e. from every state you will at some future time see event1 or event2), then C2 is true: from event3 you get event2 next, from event2 event2 already holds (or next), and from event1 the rules force 3 then 2, so eventually event2 occurs from every reachable state.

Summary answer:
- With the standard interpretation ""C1 = now (event1 ∨ event2)"" and ""C2 = always C1"", C2 is False (counterexample: initial event3).
- If C1 was meant as ""eventually (event1 ∨ event2)"" and C2 as ""always eventually (event1 ∨ event2)"", then C2 would be True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Read state-wise (C1 = ""now event1 ∨ event2""), at time 0 we have event3 so C1 is false there, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C2 is False.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Each rule says: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" ""After event2, no other events can happen."" ""After event3, no other events can happen.""
- That means any state in which event1, event2, or event3 has just happened is terminal with respect to events — no further event can occur after such a state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" Interpreted as: from the current state, the immediate next state has event3 occurring.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as the temporal always (globally) operator: at every state of the system, C1 is true (i.e., in every state the next state has event3).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- The initial state has event2. By the transition rules, when event2 has happened no other events can happen afterward — the state is terminal with respect to events. Therefore there is no next state in which event3 occurs, so C1 is false in the initial state.
- Because C1 is already false in the initial state, it cannot be true ""always."" Hence C2 is false.

- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (This rule is stated twice but is the same rule.)

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as C1 being true in the system (i.e., in all actual/possible states or along the run(s), C1 is true).

4) How do these conditions relate and final evaluation?
- Because the run starts with event3 and after event3 no other events can happen, neither event1 nor event2 ever occur in that run. So C1 is false for that run.
- Since C1 is not true (it fails in the actual run), C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Natural reading: in every execution/trace, event2 occurs at least once.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Natural reading: in every execution/trace, the statement C1 is true. (Equivalently, for all traces, event2 occurs.)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because the system starts with event3 and event3 is terminal, there is a valid trace that is just: [event3] and then nothing else. In that trace event2 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 is false (there exists a trace where event2 does not happen).
- Since C1 is not true in all traces, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Step 1 — events and initial condition

Step 2 — transition / temporal rules given
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it occurs, the execution ends — no further events).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is also terminal).

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally: C1 ⇒ (event2 occurs sometime). It asserts that because event1 always happens, event2 must occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth value of C2
- From the initial condition and the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event1 occurs at the start and is terminal, so no further events (including event2 or event3) can ever occur afterward.
- Could event2 have occurred before the initial event1? No: the initial condition places event1 at the start, so there is no earlier time for event2.
- Therefore event2 does not occur in any execution.
- C1 holds (event1 does occur always in this model), but the consequent of C2 (that event2 happens) is false.
- Since C1 is true and event2 does not happen, the implication C2 is false.

Short answer: C2 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1, event2, event3.
- Initial condition: event3 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event3, event1 must happen (i.e. the next event after event3 is event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal if event2 ever occurs).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (i.e. immediately after the current state).
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens” — logically: C2 = (Event2_next) OR (event1 happens).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the rules, since event3 happened, event1 must happen next. Therefore event1 happens.
- That implies Event2 does not happen in the next state (so C1 is false).
- But C2 is a disjunction: C1 OR event1. Because event1 does happen, the disjunction is true.

Conclusion: C1 = False; C2 = True.
