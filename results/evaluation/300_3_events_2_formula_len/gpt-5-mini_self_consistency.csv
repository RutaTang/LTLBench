Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question:
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens). We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 has occurred.)
- The other rules (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1, after event3 → event1) only add future events but don't negate the initial occurrence.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event1 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event1 to happen. Both are satisfied because event1 happened.

Conclusion: True
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked:
- We must determine whether C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the facts:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This forces event2 at some later time, but doesn’t negate event1.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Ensures event1 will occur again later.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant unless event3 occurs; nothing says event3 did.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Because event1 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Both conjuncts are true (C1 is true and event1 happened).

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
C2 is the statement ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" You are asking whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true at the start.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2 later.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → event1 later.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (irrelevant unless event3 occurs.)

Step 3 — Examine C1 and C2
- C1: event1 happens OR event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds AND event1 happens.
- Logically, C2 is equivalent to (event1 OR event2) AND event1, which simplifies to event1.

Step 4 — Evaluate against the context
Since initially event1 happened, event1 is true. Therefore C1 is true (because event1 is true), and event1 happens is true — so C2 is true.

True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future state, the immediate next state has event2).

Step 2 — understand the system rules
- Initially: event3 happens (call this state0).
- After event3 must come event1 (so state1 = event1).
- After event1 must come event2 (so state2 = event2).
- After event2 must come event1 (so state3 = event1), and thereafter event1 and event2 alternate forever.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- state0: event3
- state1: event1
- state2: event2
- state3: event1
- state4: event2
- … and so on, alternating event1, event2.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true at any state whose next state is event2. That holds at state1 (next state2 is event2), state3, state5, …
- From the initial state0, at state1 C1 holds. So there exists a future state where C1 is true.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future state where C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened (call this time 0).
- After event3, event1 must happen → at time 1: event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen → at time 2: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → at time 3: event1, and so on (alternating event1, event2).

Step 3 — trace for C1 and C2:
- At time 1 (the state after the initial), event1 holds and event2 occurs in the next state (time 2). Thus at time 1, C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is true.
- Therefore C1 holds at some future state, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (a property of a given state: its immediate successor state has event2)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists some future state where C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace the sequence:
- Initially state s0: event3 happened.
- By ""after event3, event1 must happen"" → s1: event1.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"" → s2: event2.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"" → s3: event1, and then s4: event2, etc. So the execution is: event3, event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — check C1 and C2:
- C1 is true in any state whose next state has event2 — that is exactly any state where the current event is event1.
- In particular, s1 is a future state (immediately after the initial state) where the current event is event1 and the next state s2 has event2, so C1 holds at s1.
- Therefore there exists a future state where C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- From event1, either event2 or event3 must follow.
  - If event3 follows directly, then C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
  - If event2 follows, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur, so C1 is again false.
- In all possible continuations event3 occurs (indeed you get cycles like event1 → event2 → event3 → event1 ...), so C1 can never hold, and hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e. event3 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some point in time after which C1 is true (so from that point onward event3 never happens).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After any event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so from the initial event1 one of them must occur).
- After any event2, event3 must happen.
- After any event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — try to make C1 true (no event3 ever)
- From the initial event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- If we choose event3 next, C1 is immediately violated.
- If we choose event2 next (to avoid event3), then the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur. So C1 is violated anyway.

Thus event3 must occur at least once. Moreover, once event3 occurs it forces event1, which forces either event2 or event3, and any event2 would again force event3 — so event3 cannot permanently stop occurring after some point.

Conclusion
- It is impossible that eventually (from some point onward) event3 never happens. Therefore C2 is False.

False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., no occurrence of event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — meaning there is some future point after which event3 never occurs.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- After any event2, event3 must occur.
- After any event3, event1 must occur.
- After any event1, at least one of event2 or event3 must occur.

Step 3 — trace the required sequences
- From the initial event1, the rule ""after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"" forces one of those to occur next.
  - If event3 happens next, event3 has occurred (so C1 is already false). Also after that event3, event1 must occur, returning to event1.
  - If event2 happens next, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur. So again event3 occurs, and then event1 occurs after it.
- In every case, after returning to event1 the same choice arises, and whichever option is taken leads to another event3. Thus event3 must occur repeatedly (infinitely often).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because event3 must occur (in fact, infinitely often), it is not true that from some point onward event3 never occurs.
- Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- The rules say: after event1, either event2 or event3 must occur. If event3 occurs immediately, then event3 has happened.
- If event2 occurs after event1, the rules require that event3 must occur after event2.
- Either branch therefore leads to event3 occurring at some future point, so ""Event3 eventually happens"" (C1) is true.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually it becomes true that event3 will eventually happen). Since C1 is already true from the initial state, C2 is also true (eventually-eventually collapses to eventually).
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens."" (i.e., from the initial point, at some future time event3 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point in the future it will be true that event3 eventually happens.)

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must occur next.
- If event2 occurs, then event3 must occur after event2.
- If event3 occurs, no further events occur (terminal).
Thus in every allowed execution from the initial state, event3 occurs (either immediately after event1, or after event2).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- From the initial state C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") is true because all possible continuations lead to event3.
- If a formula holds now, then it holds ""eventually"" as well (eventually φ is true if φ holds now or at some future time). Also in temporal logic F F φ ≡ F φ, so ""eventually (eventually event3)"" is equivalent to ""eventually event3"".

Conclusion
- C1 is true, and therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true.

True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point, it will be true that event3 eventually happens).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (no other possibility).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- If after event1 event3 happens immediately, then event3 happens (C1 true).
- If after event1 event2 happens, then by the rule after event2, event3 must happen later — so event3 still happens (C1 true).

In every allowed sequence, event3 occurs eventually, so C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that at some point in the future C1 will hold. Since C1 already holds from the initial state (event3 is guaranteed in every future), C1 will certainly hold at the present (and therefore at some future point). Thus C2 is also true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" (redundant) → effectively ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" → ""Event1 happens at some time (now or later).""

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. 
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing follows).
- The rules about event2 and event3 are irrelevant because no events can occur after event1.

Step 3 — Trace and reason:
- Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 is true.
- ""Eventually"" includes the present (it holds at the initial moment), so C2 is also true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" therefore means ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred at the initial point.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means no further events (including event2 or event3) occur after that initial event1.
- The rules linking event2 and event3 only apply if event2 or event3 actually occur; they don't force those events to occur when they haven't happened.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Since event1 has already happened initially, ""event1 eventually happens"" is satisfied (it holds now).
- The other rules do not prevent or contradict this; they only restrict what could happen after event1 (in this case, nothing else happens).

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" (which is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens"").
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually Event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. 
- The other rules (after event2 → event3, after event3 → event2, after event1 no other events) do not invalidate the fact that event1 already happened.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event1 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the initial state.
- ""Eventually"" is satisfied if the property holds now or at some future point; because C1 holds now, C2 is satisfied.

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e. (Event2 in next) OR (Event2 happens))

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" (in the initial state) is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So no events (including event2) can occur in the next state; therefore C1 is false.

Evaluate C2:
- C2 is (C1) OR (event2 happens). Even though C1 is false, the second disjunct ""event2 happens"" is true because event2 happened initially.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" (at the initial state) is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore no events occur in the next state after the initial event2.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the previous line, C1 is false (no events can happen after event2).
  
Step 3 — evaluate C2:
C2 is the disjunction: C1 holds OR event2 happens. C1 is false, but ""event2 happens"" is true (it happened initially). A false OR true is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e., C2 = C1 ∨ (event2 happens))

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true now).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Other rules (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event1 → no other events) are irrelevant because event2 already occurred initially and is terminal.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is false (there is no next state with event2, since after event2 no other events can happen).
- However, ""event2 happens"" (the second disjunct of C2) is true because event2 happened initially.

Therefore C2 = (false) ∨ (true) = true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens.

We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 has already occurred.)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, event3 will occur later.)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (Whenever event3 occurs, event2 will occur later.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 is not mentioned elsewhere.)

Step 3 — reason through the sequence:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and “after event2, event3 must happen,” event3 will (eventually) occur. So C1 is satisfied.
- C2 requires both C1 and that event2 happens. Event2 did happen initially, so that condition is also satisfied.

- Rule: After event2, event3 must happen. Since event2 has happened, event3 must eventually occur. Thus C1 is true.

---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens (i.e., event3 eventually happens AND event2 happens).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So because event2 happened initially, event3 must eventually occur.
- The other rules (after event3 → event2, after event1 → event3) do not prevent event3 from occurring; they only may force additional occurrences.

Step 3 — trace:
- From the initial event2 and the rule after event2 → event3, event3 will eventually happen. Thus C1 is true.
- Event2 is already true (it happened initially).

Therefore C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens) is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (we can read this as the claim that event3 occurs — at least at some times — but it's not required to be true at every instant; we'll show it's not needed anyway.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context rules
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is already true (at the start).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so from any occurrence of event2 there will be a later event3).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so occurrences of event3 force later event2).
- After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant here unless event1 occurs).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 implies a later event3, event3 will occur at some point.
- That event3 then forces another event2 later, and so on; events 2 and 3 will keep occurring alternately. Whether C1 (""event3 always happens"") is strictly true depends on the intended meaning of ""always,"" but it is unnecessary for C2.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the disjunction ""C1 or event2 happens."" The context already gives that event2 happened initially, so the right disjunct is true. Therefore C2 is true (regardless of C1).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 always happens.
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens. We must decide if C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 has happened (so ""event2 happens"" is true at least once).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant here since event1 is not given).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur next.
- Then ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 again, and so on. So event2 did occur (given) and event3 will occur following it.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the disjunction ""C1 OR event2 happens."" We already know event2 happened initially, so the right disjunct is true. Therefore C2 is true (regardless of whether C1 holds).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" (a logical disjunction).
- We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so ""event2 happens"" is true at least at the initial moment).
- Rules: after event2, event3 must happen; after event3, event2 must happen; after event1, event3 must happen.
- From the initial event2 and the rules, event3 will occur after that, and then event2 after that, and so on (a forced alternation). Whether C1 (""event3 always happens"") is taken to mean “event3 inevitably occurs” or “holds at every instant” is a subtlety, but we do not need to resolve it to evaluate C2.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 = (C1) OR (event2 happens).
- Because event2 happened initially, the right disjunct ""event2 happens"" is true.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true, so C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False (i.e., whether C1 is false).

- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (irrelevant unless event3 occurs)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happens initially and after it event2 must happen, the only enabled sequence is: event1 → event2 → stop.
- No alternative sequence omits event1 (it is given to occur initially), so event1 occurs in every execution.

- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — event2 is terminal.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" — irrelevant unless event3 occurs (no rule forces it).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Every run begins with event1 (given). Then event2 must occur, then nothing else. There is no scenario allowed by the premises in which a run does not contain event1.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds (event1 always happens), so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C1 says ""Event1 always happens."" C2 is its negation: ""Event1 does not always happen.""
- From the context we know ""Initially, event1 happened."" That guarantees event1 occurred in the given initial run.
- The other sentences constrain what happens after events (after event1 → event2 must happen; after event2 no further events; after event3 no further events), but none of them state that event1 must occur in every possible run or at every time.
- Therefore ""event1 always happens"" is not entailed by the premises — we only have a particular initial occurrence, not a universal guarantee. Hence C1 does not hold, so C2 is True."

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one).

Step 2 — Use the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- Thus the next state must be one where event2 or event3 happens (not event1).

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- In the next state event1 does not happen (because the next event is event2 or event3).
- Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state.""
- C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""
So we must decide whether, in the immediate next state after the initial state, the proposition ""Event1 does not happen"" is true.

Step 2 — use the given rules
- Initially, event1 happened. (So C1 is false in the initial state.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (the next event cannot be event1).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so a possible sequence is event1 → event2 → event3).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event1 cannot reoccur after event3).

Step 3 — reason about the next state
- The next state after the initial state must be one where either event2 or event3 occurs.
- In that next state, event1 does not occur (because the next event is either event2 or event3, not event1).

Conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"", where C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""
- The context says initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen."" Thus in the state immediately after the initial state the system must have event2 or event3.
- In that next state one of event2 or event3 occurs, so event1 is not occurring in that next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true in the next state, so C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1 = ""Event3 always happens"" means: from some moment onward, at every future instant event3 occurs (the usual reading of ""always"" = globally).
- From the context: initially event2 happened, so event3 must happen afterward. Thus event3 will occur (at least once). But after event3, no other events can happen — the run stops producing events.
- That means there is no time point from which event3 holds at every future instant (event3 occurs once and then does not keep occurring). So C1 is false at all times.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- The rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur (at or after the next step).
- Once event3 happens, the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" prevents any further changes; the system is stuck with event3.
- Therefore there is a point in time (right after event3 occurs) from which event3 holds forever — i.e. C1 becomes true from that point onward.
- That exactly means ""C1 eventually holds,"" so C2 is True.

Sample responses:
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" That is true in the initial state because the context says ""Initially, event2 happened.""

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This asks whether, starting from the immediate successor state, event2 will eventually occur in the future (the usual meaning of ""eventually"" is some time at or after the current point).

- But the context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 already happened initially, there are no future events after that point — in particular, event2 will not occur again in the future of the next state. Thus from the next state the eventuality ""event2 will happen"" is not satisfied.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the immediate successor state, event2 will eventually happen).

2. Understand the conditions:
   - Initially, event2 happened. So C1 is true at the initial state (event2 has already occurred, and ""eventually"" is satisfied).
   - ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means once event2 has occurred the system has no further events (no successor states where new events occur).
   - The ""after event3, event2 must happen"" clause is irrelevant here because event3 does not occur initially.

3. Trace the sequence:
   - We start in the initial state where event2 has already occurred.
   - There is no meaningful future occurrence of event2 after the initial state because after event2 no other events can happen (no successor state with event2).

4. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 requires that, in the next state, event2 will eventually occur. But either there is no next state (so the ""next"" formula is false), or there is a next state but no further events occur there (so event2 does not occur in that state's future). In either interpretation, C1 does not hold when evaluated at the next state.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, event2 already happened initially, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 says: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state.
- But the context also says: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 has already happened initially, there are no successor states (no further events/transitions possible).
- With no next state available, the claim that C1 holds in the next state fails (the next state does not exist, so C2 is false).

Therefore C2 is False."

- After event1 → event2, after event2 → event3, forming a cycle 3 → 1 → 2 → 3 across successive states.

- Therefore, event3 cannot happen in that next state.

First, identify the hypothesis:

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., Event3 does not happen in the next state.)

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened (current state = event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so the next state after event3 is event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (then event2).
- After event2, event3 must happen (then event3), giving a cycle.

Trace the sequence from the initial state:
- Current: event3.
- Next state (immediately after event3): event1 (by the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"").

Therefore C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not happen in the next state).
You are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — apply the rules:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule after event3: either event1 or event2 must happen next. That excludes event3 happening in the next state.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- C1 is false (event3 cannot happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

First, the hypothesis: C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state."" C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not happen in the next state). You ask whether C2 is True or False.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened (current state = event3).
- Rule: After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen in the next state.
- (Other rules: after event1 → event2 must happen; after event2 → either event1 or event3 must happen — these affect later states but not the immediate next state from the initial event3.)

From the rule for after event3, the next state must be event1 or event2. Therefore event3 cannot happen in the next state; C1 is false. Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Sample responses:
Identify the hypothesis:
- C2 = ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens"".

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Trace the sequence:
- Since event2 happened initially and after event2 event3 must happen, event3 does indeed occur. So C1 is true.
- C2 is ""Event1 happens OR C1 holds"". Because C1 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 ever occurs.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — what C2 asks:
- C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens OR Event3 eventually happens"" (i.e., Event1 ∨ C1).

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. Therefore event3 does eventually happen (C1 is true).
- Once C1 is true, C2 = (Event1 ∨ C1) is true regardless of whether Event1 ever occurs.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" (where C1 is ""Event3 eventually happens""). We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event2 happened initially and ""after event2, event3 must happen,"" event3 will (eventually) occur. So C1 is true.
- C2 is ""event1 happens OR C1 holds."" Because C1 holds, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 ever happens.

Sample responses:
First, what C2 asks: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event3 eventually happens."" So C2 claims: whenever event2 occurs, event3 will eventually occur.

Examine the given conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

These are strict ""must happen"" transitions. That means any occurrence of event2 is followed (eventually, immediately in the next step by the given rule) by an occurrence of event3.

Trace the relevant sequence: if event2 happens at some point, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" guarantees event3 will occur afterward, so C1 (event3 eventually happens) is true in that case.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — equivalently: ""If event2 happens, then eventually event3 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur eventually).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, event3 will occur eventually).
- After event3, event1 must happen (completes the cycle).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event1, event2 must occur.
- Once event2 occurs, event3 must occur.
- So event3 does eventually happen (C1 is true).
- The rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" directly states that if event2 happens then event3 will eventually happen, which is exactly C2.

Final answer:
True

Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event2 occurs, event3 will eventually occur.

Examine conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Trace reasoning:
- From the initial event1, event2 must occur (by the third rule).
- Once event2 occurs, event3 must occur (by the second rule).
- Thus event3 does eventually happen (so C1 is true in this scenario).
- More generally, any occurrence of event2 forces a later occurrence of event3.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — claims that in every possible scenario given the context, event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — claims that C1 is false (i.e., event2 does not always happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred at the start.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2 or event3) can occur afterward.
- The other rules (""After event2, event3 must happen"" and ""After event3, no other events can happen"") are irrelevant if event2 cannot occur.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Since event1 has already happened initially and it blocks any subsequent events, there is no possible sequence in which event2 occurs.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in any allowed scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer:
True

First, restating the hypotheses:
- C1: Event2 always happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., ""Event2 does not always happen"").

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, the sequence stops.)
- After event2, event3 must happen; after event3, no other events can happen. (These only matter if event2 ever occurs.)

Trace the possible sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, the world is already in a terminal state where no further events (including event2) can occur.
- There is no allowed sequence in which event2 must occur; event2 can be blocked by the initial event1. Therefore event2 does not always happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., C1 is false)

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2, event3 must happen; after event3, no other events can happen — these are irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" holds, no further events (including event2) can occur in any allowed sequence.
- Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen in any execution consistent with the context.

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C2 states: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to: whenever event1 occurs, both event1 and event2 occur (i.e., event2 occurs as well).

Step 2 — use the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened — so event2 occurs (already true).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. From the initial event2, therefore some of event1 or event3 will occur.
- If event3 occurs, then after event3, event1 must happen. So from the initial event2 we get that event1 will occur in all cases (either directly after event2, or after event2→event3→event1).
- Also, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" ensures that whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards.

Step 3 — conclude
Thus event1 does occur (given the initial event2), and whenever event1 occurs event2 also occurs. So C1 (event2 and event1 happen) is true whenever event1 happens. Therefore the implication C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. C2 reads: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to: event1 → (event2 ∧ event1), which simplifies to event1 → event2 (since event1 is already assumed in the antecedent).

2. From the given rules: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That directly states that whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterward. Thus event1 → event2 holds in every allowed sequence.

3. Therefore whenever event1 happens, both event1 (trivially) and event2 hold, so C1 holds. Hence C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — restate:
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens (e2 ∧ e1).
- C2: if event1 happens then C1 holds (e1 → (e2 ∧ e1)), which is equivalent to e1 → e2.

Step 2 — use the given rules:
- The context includes ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That directly says: whenever e1 occurs, e2 will occur (i.e., e1 → e2).

Step 3 — conclude:
- Since e1 → e2 is guaranteed by the context, C2 is true.

Step 1 — What is being asked
- C2 says: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. ""If event1 happens, then event3 does not happen.""

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → event3)
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — Trace consequences
- From event1 → event2 and event2 → event3, if event1 happens then event2 happens and therefore event3 must happen.
- That contradicts C1 (event3 does not happen). So C1 cannot hold in any trace where event1 happens.
- Also, since event2 initially happened, event3 must happen regardless.

Conclusion
- C2 is false. 

False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then event3 does not happen"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened (given).
- After event2, event3 must happen. Since event2 already happened initially, event3 must occur at some point.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false in every execution that respects the rules.
- C2 says: if event1 happens then C1 holds. To refute C2, we need a valid execution where event1 happens and event3 also happens.
- Such an execution is possible: start with the initial event2 (given), then have event1 occur before the mandated event3. After event1, event2 must happen again (allowed), and after that event2 event3 must happen. So event1 happens and event3 happens.
- That execution respects all constraints and violates C2.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every point in time/event occurrence).
- The context says ""Initially, event2 happened"" and also ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means once event2 has occurred, the system reaches a state with no further events.
- The next state after the initial event therefore contains no event occurrences. In that state event2 does not happen (it already happened previously).
- So C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not true in the next state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. event2 holds at all times).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — the claim that, in the immediate next state, C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred (as it did initially), no further events occur in any subsequent state.
- After event3, event1 must happen — irrelevant here because event3 never occurs (event2 happened first and blocks further events).
- After event1, no other events can happen — also irrelevant because event1 does not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- ""Event2 always happens"" requires event2 to hold at every state. We know event2 holds in the initial state but, because no events occur after event2, in the next state event2 does not occur (there are no events happening there). Therefore C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is false (event2 does not hold in the next state), C2 is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 says “Event2 always happens” — i.e., in every future state/event step event2 occurs.
- The context says “Initially, event2 happened” and “After event2, no other events can happen.” So event2 happens at the initial state and then the system is terminal: there are no further event occurrences.
- In the (immediate) next state there is either no transition at all or there are states with no events. In either case event2 does not occur in that next state, so the property “event2 always happens” does not hold there.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (interpreted as: every occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists a point after which C1 is true; if C1 is already always true, C2 is also true.)

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so every event1 is followed by some event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so every event2 is followed by some event1).
- After event3, event1 must happen (irrelevant unless event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence
- Start: event1.
- By the rules, that event1 will be followed by event2, which in turn will be followed by event1, and so on — yielding an infinite alternation ... event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
- Therefore every occurrence of event2 is indeed followed by an occurrence of event1.

Conclusion
- C1 holds (in fact from the start) because the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees it.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the run C1 is true; here C1 is actually a rule about occurrences).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur (following the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen. So whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows.
- (Also: after event3, event1 must happen — irrelevant unless event3 occurs.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From the initial event1 we get event2, then event1, then event2, … so event2 does happen and each event2 is followed by event1.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" directly entails C1 (if event2 happens then event1 happens).
- Since C1 holds from the start (indeed on every occurrence of event2), it certainly ""eventually holds.""

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted with the context, this means: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur (after it).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This asks whether at some point in the execution (and thereafter) the property C1 becomes true. If C1 is true from the start, that also satisfies ""eventually.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So every time event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 will occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So every time event2 occurs, a subsequent event1 will occur.
- (Also: after event3, event1 must happen — irrelevant if event3 never occurs.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- We start with event1 (given).
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get event2 next.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we get event1 next.
- This alternation repeats indefinitely: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- In this trace, every occurrence of event2 is followed by event1. Thus C1 holds (in fact, globally).
- If C1 holds globally, then certainly it ""eventually holds"" (it holds immediately and forever). Therefore C2 is true.

- After event2, no other events can happen. (Not relevant since event2 did not occur.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (Not triggered because event1 did not occur.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Because event3 happened initially, the statement ""Event3 happens"" is true. Therefore C1 (""Event3 happens or event2 happens"") is true (since event3 happens). C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is also true (event3 happens already makes it true).

Logical note: C2 is equivalent to (event3 or (event3 or event2)) which simplifies to event3 or event2, and with event3 true the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
We must decide whether C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 does happen.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So nothing else happens after that.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant since event2 does not occur.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (Irrelevant since event1 does not occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate the claims
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Since event3 did happen initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Event3 happens (and C1 also holds), so C2 is true.

Final answer:

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e., Event2 happens ∨ Event1 does not happen)
The question: is C2 True or False?

Step 2 — use the given conditions
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" ⇒ Event2 does happen (at least once).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" ⇒ nothing can occur after that initial Event2 (so Event1 cannot occur later).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Since Event2 happens (given), the disjunction Event2 ∨ (Event1 does not happen) is true regardless of the status of C1.
- (Also, from ""after event2 no other events can happen"" we get Event1 does not happen, so C1 is true as well; either way C2 holds.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e., Event2 happens OR Event1 does not happen)

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That prevents event1 and event3 from happening after the initial event2.
- The other rules (""after event1 → event2"", ""after event3 → event1 or event2"") are irrelevant here because no events can occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event2 happened initially, event2 happens is true.
- Because no events can occur after event2, event1 does not happen, so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""event2 happens OR C1 holds"" — both disjuncts are true, so C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1 = ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2 = ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., Event2 happens ∨ Event1 does not happen).
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — facts and rules from the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 does happen.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 is terminal.)
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reasoning about C2
- C2 is a disjunction; it is true if event2 happens (regardless of whether C1 holds).
- The context explicitly says event2 happened initially, so the disjunct ""Event2 happens"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — restate relevant conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (For completeness) After event2, event3 must happen; after event3, event2 must happen — these create a mutual requirement between 2 and 3, but they only matter if 2 or 3 can occur.

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- Because event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, neither event2 nor event3 can occur after event1.
- Therefore, if event1 happens, event3 does not happen (C1 holds).

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, events 2 and 3 cannot occur afterward.
- The rules about event2↔event3 are irrelevant because neither can occur after event1.

Step 3 — trace sequences and evaluate C1 and C2:
- Given event1 occurred and no events can happen after it, event3 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- Since event1 happens and that guarantees event3 does not happen, the implication ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 occurs as the initial/first event.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal; nothing can occur after it.)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Since event1 happened initially and nothing can happen after event1, neither event2 nor event3 can occur later.
- There are no events before the initial event1 (because event1 is initial), so event2 and event3 cannot have happened before event1 either.
- Therefore event3 does not happen at all in this scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Antecedent (""event1 happens"") is true (it happened initially).
- Consequent (C1: ""event3 does not happen"") is true given the terminal nature of event1.
- Therefore the conditional ""If event1 happens, then event3 does not happen"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the run, C1 is true).

Step 2 — use the facts
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment, event2 has occurred, hence C1 is already true at the initial state.
- The other rules (no events after event2; after event1 → event2; after event3 → event1 or event2) do not contradict or change the fact that C1 holds now.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 says that sometime in the run C1 will hold. Since C1 already holds at the initial state, there is such a time (now). Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Eventually, C1 holds"" (i.e. at some future point the property ""event2 eventually happens"" is true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So C1 is true at the initial moment.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so the future is a stuttering continuation where no new events occur.
- The other conditions (after event1 → event2, after event3 → event1 or event2) don't conflict with the fact that event2 already happened.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- Since C1 is already true now, ""eventually C1"" is true (eventually includes the current point). Also logically F F p = F p, so ""eventually (eventually event2)"" is equivalent to ""eventually event2"".

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = ""eventually (eventually Event2)"". (In temporal logic eventually(eventually p) is equivalent to eventually p.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened. So Event2 has already occurred at the start.
- Also, after Event2 no other events can happen (trace terminates after that).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- Since Event2 has already happened initially, C1 is true (Event2 eventually happens is satisfied immediately).
- Because C1 holds now, ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true (something that holds now certainly holds at some future-or-now point).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C2 says: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — the context constraints
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true at the start.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, the run is terminal.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (Not needed for this question.)

Step 3 — examine C1
C1 is ""event2 happens"" (the repetition is redundant). Given the context, because event1 already happened initially and that forbids any events afterward, event2 cannot actually occur in any allowed execution. So C1 is impossible (false) in every permitted scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2 (the implication)
An implication ""If C1 then event1"" is true whenever C1 is impossible (vacuously true). Also, independently, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" directly ensures that if event2 did occur, event1 would occur after it. Either way, the implication holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis
- C1 asserts ""event2 happens"" (the repetition is redundant).
- C2 asserts ""if C1 holds (i.e. if event2 happens) then event1 happens"" — equivalently: if event2 happens then event1 happens.

Step 2 — Examine the context rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" — this directly states exactly the implication in C2.
- (Additional context: initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, which actually prevents event2 from occurring, but that only makes C1 false; it does not invalidate the implication.)

Step 3 — Conclusion
- Because the context includes the rule ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" C2 is true (and even if event2 cannot occur, the conditional is vacuously true).

Final answer:
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context: initially event1 happened; and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore no events can occur after that initial event1.
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- Given the context, event2 cannot happen (it would have to occur after the initial event1, but no events can occur after event1). So C1 is false in every allowed scenario.
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"". An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Therefore C2 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 asserts that in the next state, C1 holds.
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or Event3 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"" means the immediate next state after the initial one must have event2 or event3.
- The other rules (after event2 → event1 or event3; after event3 → event2) do not prevent event2 or event3 occurring next.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since after the initial event1 the next state must contain either event2 or event3, C1 holds in the next state. Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" i.e. in the next state, event2 or event3 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen."" (This directly constrains the immediate next state.)
- The other rules (after event2 → either event1 or event3; after event3 → event2) govern subsequent states but do not contradict the rule after event1.

Step 3 — trace the sequence from the initial state:
- Because event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"" forces the next state to have event2 or event3.

Conclusion:
- Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens"" (i.e., event2 ∨ event3 in a state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, event2 ∨ event3 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and initial state:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- One condition states: ""After event1, either event2, or event3 must happen."" That means in the state immediately following any state where event1 holds, the next state must satisfy event2 ∨ event3.

Step 3 — apply to the initial state:
- Since event1 holds initially, the next state is required to have event2 or event3.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = not(Event2 and Event1).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened. So Event2 does happen (at least at the start).
- After Event2, Event3 must happen.
- After Event3, either Event1 or Event2 must happen.
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- One possible sequence: Event2 (initial) -> Event3 -> Event1. This sequence makes both Event2 and Event1 occur, so C1 holds in this model.
- Another possible sequence: Event2 -> Event3 -> Event2 -> Event3 -> ... (always choose Event2 after Event3). In this model Event1 never occurs, so C1 does not hold.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid sequence in which C1 holds, C1 is not ruled out by the conditions. Thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not necessarily true; it is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" So C2 claims that event1 does not happen (since event2 does happen initially).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- One possible trace: event2 (initial) → event3 (forced) → event1 (choose this after event3). In this trace both event2 and event1 occur, so C1 holds and C2 does not.
- Another possible trace: event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ... (always choose event2 after event3). In this trace event1 never occurs, so C1 does not hold and C2 would hold in that trace.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because there exist traces where C1 holds and traces where it does not, C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is not true (in the sense of being entailed).

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true given the rules.

What hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: the negation of C1 (i.e., ""C1 does not hold"").

Examine the conditions and trace possible events
- Initially event2 happens (so event2 does occur).
- After event2, event3 must happen → sequence: event2, then event3.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. Choose event1 → sequence: event2, event3, event1.
- Thus both event2 (initial) and event1 (later) occur; C1 can be satisfied.

Conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence satisfying C1, C1 does not fail in all models, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the proposition ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e. simply event2 happens).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — that is, in the state immediately following the current one.

Step 2 — examine the context conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so a state where event2 has happened has no successor states).
- After event1, no other events can happen (not used here).
- After event3, event2 must happen (not usable because event3 cannot occur after event2, since event2 is terminal).

- We start in the initial state where event2 holds.
- Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" there is no next state reachable from the initial state.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold in the next state. But there is no next state, so C1 cannot hold ""in the next state.""
- Under the standard semantics where ""next"" requires an existing successor state, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initially, event2 happened — so in the initial state event2 has occurred.

2. The context rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means that once event2 has occurred there are no further events possible afterward. In particular, there is no later state in which any event (including event2) can occur.

3. C1 is just the statement ""event2 happens"" (repeated). C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event2 must happen in the next state.

4. Because no events can occur after event2, there is no next state in which event2 can happen. Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" (which is equivalent to just ""event2 happens"").
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state).

Step 2 — understand the constraints:
- Initially, event2 happened — so C1 is true in the initial state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal: there is no successor state following a state where event2 has happened.
- The other constraints (about event1 and event3) don't affect this situation because event2 already happened initially.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires a next state in which C1 holds.
- Because event2 is terminal, there is no next state after the initial state. Under standard ""next"" semantics, if there is no successor state then ""next"" formulas are false.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context we have these rules: initially event2 happens; after event2 → event1; after event1 → event2; after event3 → event1.
- There is no rule that ever produces event3, nor any rule that links event1 (or ""event1 always"") to event3.
- The system forces an alternation of event1 and event2 after the initial event2, so event1 does occur repeatedly, but it does not ""force"" event3 to occur.
- Therefore “If event1 always happens, then event3 happens” is not entailed by the context; C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You ask whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is true or false given the context and C1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence(s)
Starting from the initial event2, the rules force the sequence:
event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … (alternating forever).
Event3 is never required by any rule and need not occur in this run. Event1 therefore does occur repeatedly (so C1 can hold), yet event3 can still never happen.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
C2 claims that whenever C1 holds, event3 happens. That is not entailed by the rules: C1 can hold while event3 never occurs. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context/rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → event1)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (event3 → event1)
There is no rule that causes event3 to occur.

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequence
- Start: event2 (given).
- By event2 → event1, event1 happens next.
- By event1 → event2, event2 happens next.
- This yields an alternating loop: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Thus event1 does indeed occur (in fact infinitely often) — so C1 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that if C1 holds then event3 happens.
- But nothing in the rules forces event3 at any point; the loop between event1 and event2 can continue forever without ever producing event3.
- Therefore C1 holding does not imply event3 happens.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point in time the property C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (whenever event2 occurs, event3 will occur afterwards)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (whenever event3 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (whenever event1 occurs, event3 will occur afterwards)

Step 3 — reason about C1
- ""After event1, event3 must happen"" is exactly the statement of C1 (whenever event1 occurs, event3 follows). So C1 is true by the given conditions.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 already holds (true from the start), it certainly ""eventually holds."" Therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens."" (equivalently: after event1, event3 must happen.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C1 will be true at some point (or from some point onward) given the context.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, a later event3 must occur.)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (Whenever event3 occurs, a later event2 must occur.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (Exactly the same statement as C1.)

Step 3 — reason about the sequences
- From the pair ""after event3 → event2"" and ""after event2 → event3"" and the fact that event3 happened initially, events 2 and 3 will occur repeatedly (they force each other), so those liveness obligations are satisfied.
- The rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" is explicitly in the context; that is exactly C1.
- Even if event1 never actually occurs, the implication ""if event1 happens then event3 happens"" is vacuously true on every trace where event1 does not occur.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 is given as a constraint in the premises, C1 already holds (either explicitly by the rule or vacuously if event1 never occurs). Therefore C1 does hold (indeed from the start), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens."" (a rule/implication)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C1 becomes true at some point (or already holds).

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- ""After event1, event3 must happen."" This is exactly the same as C1: whenever event1 occurs, event3 will follow.
- Other context facts (initially event3; event2↔event3 forcing) do not contradict the rule about event1.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- C1 is entailed immediately by the context (it already holds).
- Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is true (it holds now, so it certainly holds at some future point).

- C1 is the proposition “Event1 does not happen.”
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one).

Step 2 — apply the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule “After event3, event2 must happen” forces the next event to be event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state:
- In that next state the event that happens is event2, not event1, so “Event1 does not happen” is true in the next state.

Therefore C2 is True.

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event2 must happen"" forces the next state to be event2.
- C1 says ""Event1 does not happen."" In the next state (which is event2), event1 does not occur.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" — i.e. C2 is the implication C1 → (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
These rules produce a guaranteed infinite alternation between event2 and event3 starting from the initial state; there is no rule that ever produces event1, so in the actual run event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — truth of C2
- In the actual model C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Even if one reads both antecedent and consequent as referring to the same ""next state"", C2 is either trivially true (because C1 already asserts event1 in the next state) or vacuously true (because C1 cannot hold under the given dynamics).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.
- C1 is ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So C2 is essentially: if ""Event1 happens in the next state"" holds, then ""event1 happens.""

Step 2 — interpret the implication
- C2's antecedent is the claim that event1 occurs (in the next state). The consequent is that event1 occurs (period).
- If the antecedent holds, it already asserts that event1 happens (in some state), so the consequent is satisfied. Thus the implication is true whenever the antecedent is true.
- If the antecedent never holds, the implication is vacuously true.

Step 3 — relation to the context
- The context constraints about events (initially event2, and transition obligations) do not make the implication false; at worst they make the antecedent false, which still makes the implication true vacuously.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 occurs at the start.
2. It also states ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore no event (including event2 or event3) can occur after that initial event1. So the only actual event in any valid timeline is event1.
3. C1 (""event3 happens or event1 happens"") is true because event1 does happen.
4. C2 is the conditional ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" In the allowed timelines event2 never happens, so the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true. (Even from the rules, any hypothetical occurrence of event2 would force event1 or event3 afterwards, but that hypothetical is unnecessary here.)

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 is the statement: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., event3 happens or event1 happens)."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, the sequence ends.
- The other rules (after event2 → event1 or event3; after event3 → event2) cannot override the fact that after the initial event1 nothing else can occur.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event3 or event1 happens"") is true because event1 happened initially.
- For C2 (""if event2 happens then C1 holds""):
  - In fact event2 cannot happen at any time because event1 happens initially and that forbids any further events. So the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is false in all permitted sequences, making the implication vacuously true.
  - (Even if one tried to consider a sequence where event2 did occur, the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" would ensure C1 anyway.)

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (C1 = ""event3 happens or event1 happens"".)

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no further events. So the actual sequence is just event1 (and then stop).
- Therefore C1 (event3 or event1 happens) is true, since event1 did happen.
- Also, event2 cannot occur in any valid sequence (it would require events after the initial event1, which is forbidden).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Since C1 is already true in all allowed sequences, the implication ""if event2 happens then C1"" is true regardless.
- Equivalently, the antecedent (event2 happens) is impossible in the allowed runs, so the implication is vacuously true.

Step 1 — identify the question:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event3 happens"", where C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"".
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- Rules: after event1 → event3 must happen; after event3 → event2 must happen; after event2 → event3 must happen.
- From the initial event3 we get a required sequence: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → … so event3 occurs (at least initially, and repeatedly thereafter).

Step 3 — trace consequences relevant to C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: (Event1 does not happen) OR (event3 happens).
- The context explicitly says event3 happened initially, so the disjunct ""event3 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since event3 happened, C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- (Also: after event1, event3 must happen — but nothing forces event1 to occur.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event3 happened initially, event2 must happen next, then event3 must happen again, then event2, and so on. Thus event3 does indeed happen (at least initially and repeatedly).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is true if either event1 never happens, or event3 happens. We have event3 happening, so C2 is true regardless of whether event1 happens later.

- The formula ""if p then p"" (p → p) is a tautology: it is true regardless of whether p (here, ""event2 happens"") is true or false. If event2 happens, p→p is true; if event2 does not happen, p→p is still true (false → anything is true).
- Therefore C1 is true at every state on every trace.

Step 3 — examine event sequences (for completeness)
- Traces start with event1, then either event2 (terminates) or event3 then event1 again, etc. Whether the system eventually takes event2 or loops with event3 does not matter, because C1 is already true at all times.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C1 holds immediately (and everywhere), ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the formula ""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. event2 → event2).
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some point in the run at which C1 is true).

2) Examine C1:
- The implication A → A is a logical tautology: it is true in every state regardless of whether A (here: event2) actually holds. So C1 is true at every point in every possible execution.

3) Trace event sequences (given for completeness):
- Start with event1.
- After event1 either event2 (terminates) or event3 (forces event1 again) happens.
- Possible runs: event1 → event2 (then stop), or infinite cycles event1 → event3 → event1 → ...
  None of this affects the fact that C1 is a tautology and hence true at every moment.

4) Conclusion:
- Since C1 is true immediately (and at all times), ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Therefore C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is ""event3 happens and event3 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction and simplifies to ""event3 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds,"" i.e. ""event3 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 is true at the initial time.)
- The other rules (after event3 → event1, after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1) enforce future behavior but do not prevent the initial occurrence of event3.

Step 3 — trace/reason
- Since event3 already happened initially, C1 (which is equivalent to ""event3 happens"") holds right away.
- Therefore C2 (""event3 eventually happens"") is satisfied immediately.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" which is equivalent to ""Event3 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. ""eventually Event3 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- It is given that initially Event3 happened.
- The other rules (after Event3 → Event1, after Event1 ↔ Event2 obligations) impose obligations for future events but do not undo or negate that the initial Event3 occurred.

Step 3 — trace & conclude
- Since Event3 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the start.
- Therefore ""eventually C1"" is satisfied (it holds immediately).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""event3 happens and event3 happens"" (which is logically equivalent to just ""event3 happens"").
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e., ""event3 happens eventually"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. 
- The other rules (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1, after event3 → event1) impose obligations about future events but do not undo or forbid the already-occurring event3.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event3 has already occurred initially, C1 is already true at the initial moment.
- Therefore C1 holds now, so C1 ""eventually"" holds (it holds immediately).

C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the formula ""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 → event2).
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (it is true in every possible situation).

Step 2 — examine C1
- In propositional/standard logic, p → p is a tautology: it is true for any truth value of p.
- Even if event2 never occurs, the implication is still true (false antecedent makes implication true).

Step 3 — consider the context/constraints
- The given constraints (initial event1, mutual requirement between event1 and event3, and that event2 implies event3) do not affect the logical status of the tautology event2 → event2.
- There is no scenario under those constraints that would make p → p false.

Conclusion
- C1 is always true, so C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- Let P be ""event2 happens"".
- C1 is P → P, i.e. ""if event2 happens then event2 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen; after event3, event1 must happen (they force each other).
- After event2, event3 must happen (which then forces event1, etc.).
- None of these rules affect the logical form of C1.

Step 3 — logic of C1
- P → P is a tautology in standard logic: it is true in every possible state whether or not P actually occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Since C1 is always true (a tautology) under the given dynamics, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is the formula ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. event2 → event2).
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (is true in all situations allowed by the context).

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The implication p → p is a logical tautology: it is true whether p is true or false. So C1 is true in every possible state or trace.

Step 3 — relevance of the given context:
- The context constraints (relations among event1, event3, event2) do not affect the tautological truth of event2 → event2. Those rules may constrain event occurrences, but they cannot make a logical tautology false.

Conclusion:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every reachable state/run, C1 is true).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- From the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 next.
- After that event3, the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 next.
- These rules enforce an infinite alternation: ..., event2, event3, event2, event3, ...
- Therefore event3 does occur (indeed infinitely often) in the execution.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true (event3 eventually happens).
- Because from every point in the run there will be a future event3 (the alternation continues), C1 holds at all times in all reachable executions. Hence C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., at every point in execution, it is still true that event3 will eventually occur — G F event3.)

Step 2 — examine the given rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- From the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 next (or at least at some next step).
- After that event3, the rule forces event2, and so on. Thus the system alternates event2, event3, event2, event3, ... forever.
- At any point in that run:
  - If the current/latest event is event2, the next required event is event3 (so event3 occurs next).
  - If the current/latest event is event3, then event2 will occur next and then event3 after that — so event3 will occur again in the future.
- The rule about event1 only adds that if event1 occurs it must be followed by event2 or event3; both choices still lead to event3 eventually.

Step 4 — conclusion
- From every reachable state in the described system, event3 is guaranteed to occur at some future time. Therefore ""event3 eventually happens"" holds at all times.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what C2 means:
- C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens"" (there exists a future time with event3).
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" = from every point in time, event3 will eventually happen (i.e., always eventually event3).

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After any event2, event3 must happen.
- After any event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, at least one of event2 or event3 must happen (this cannot prevent event2/3).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event2, event3 must occur.
- After that event3, event2 must occur.
- After that event2, event3 must occur again.
- This forces an infinite alternation ... event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → ...
- Therefore, at every point in time there is a future event3.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the conditional: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""

Step 2 — interpret C1:
- C1 asserts ""Event1 always happens"" (so C1 entails that event1 does occur).

Step 3 — examine the conditional:
- If C1 is true, then by C1's content event1 happens. So the antecedent directly entails the consequent.
- If C1 were false, the implication ""If C1 then event1"" is vacuously true.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (i.e., C1 ⇒ event1)

Step 2 — logical relation
- C1 asserts that event1 holds (indeed, always).
- Therefore, if C1 is true, event1 is true by definition.

Step 3 — conclusion
- The implication C1 ⇒ event1 is trivially true (the antecedent entails the consequent).

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 says: ""Event1 always happens."" That means if C1 holds, event1 occurs (in the relevant sense).
- C2 is the conditional: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is logically entailed by the meaning of C1 — C1 already asserts event1 happens, so C1 implies event1.
- Thus C2 is true (it is a valid implication; even independent of the context it is tautologically satisfied)."

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: event1 happened initially.
2. The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" gives event2.
3. The rule ""After event2, event3 must happen"" then gives event3.
4. The rules ""After event2, event3 must happen"" and ""After event3, event2 must happen"" together mean event2 ↔ event3; in particular, event2 → event3 holds. So C1 is true (it follows from the context).
5. C2 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" But event1 already happened initially (it is given in the context), so the conditional is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. (event1 is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (so event2 happens)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (so event3 happens)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (cycle continues)

Step 3 — check each condition:
- C1 matches the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen,"" so C1 is true in the context.
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event1."" But event1 is already true in the context (it happened initially).

Step 4 — conclude:
- An implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent. Since event1 is true, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."")

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → event3)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → event2)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- The context explicitly includes ""after event2, event3 must happen,"" i.e. event2 → event3. So C1 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 says: if C1 holds then event1 happens.
- We have established C1 holds. The context also states event1 happened initially, so event1 is true.
- Therefore the implication (C1 → event1) is true (antecedent true and consequent true).

Sample responses:
We evaluate C2 at the initial state (where the context says event3 happened).

1. C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (unknown/undetermined from the context)
2. C2 = ""C1 holds OR event3 happens."" The natural reading (given how C1 was phrased) is that the disjunct ""event3 happens"" refers to the current (initial) state.
3. The context explicitly states that initially event3 happened, so the second disjunct of C2 is true at the initial state.
4. Therefore C2 is true (the disjunction is true regardless of C1).

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event3 happens"", where C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened (so ""event3 happens"" is already true in the initial state).
- The other rules constrain future transitions but do not negate the fact that event3 already occurred.

Step 3 — reason:
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Since ""event3 happens"" is true initially, the disjunction C2 is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — clarify the statements
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the state after the current one).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" (a disjunction evaluated at the current state).

Step 2 — use the context to trace states
- Initially (current state s0): event3 happened (so event3 is true at s0).
- After event3 (so at s1): event2 must happen → s1: event2.
- After event2 (at s2): either event1 or event3 must happen → s2: event1 or event3.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 at s0
- C1 (event1 in the next state s1) is false because s1 has event2, not event1.
- C2 = C1 or event3. Even though C1 is false, event3 is true at s0, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- Interpret states: let state0 be the initial state where event3 happened.
- Rules:
  - After event3, the next state must have event1.
  - After event1, the next state must have event3.
  - (After event2 → next event3 is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)
- From state0 (event3 occurred), state1 must have event1. So at state0, C1 (""event3 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., at state1, C1 should be true. At state1 we have event1, and by the rule after event1 the next state (state2) must have event3. So at state1, C1 (""event3 happens in the next state"") is true.

Therefore C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — interpret C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., one step ahead from the current state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning: in the next state, C1 is true; equivalently, event3 happens in the state two steps ahead.

Step 2 — apply the context to a timeline (state0 = initial):
- state0: event3 happened (given).
- From ""after event3, event1 must happen"" → state1 must have event1.
- From ""after event1, event3 must happen"" → state2 must have event3.
- The rule about event2 is not used here.

Step 3 — evaluate:
- C1 at state0? No — state1 has event1, not event3, so C1 is false at state0.
- C2 at state0? Yes — in the next state (state1), its next state (state2) has event3, so C1 holds in the next state. Thus C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e. from the initial state s0, event3 holds at s1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. from s0, in s1 the proposition C1 is true — equivalently, event3 holds at s2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and initial facts:
- Initially (s0) event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen → because event3 holds at s0, event1 must hold at s1.
- After event1, event3 must happen → because event1 holds at s1, event3 must hold at s2.
- After event2, event3 must happen → irrelevant here unless event2 occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event3 at s1): Not guaranteed by the rules. The rules force event1 at s1 but do not require event3 at s1, so C1 need not hold at s1.
- C2 (C1 holds at s1, i.e. event3 at s2): Because s1 must have event1, the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 at s2. Thus C1 is true in s1, so C2 is true relative to s0.

True"

Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state after the initial, event2 occurs).
- After event2, event3 must happen, and after event3, event2 must happen (so event2 and event3 alternate thereafter).
- There is no rule forcing event1 to occur again after the initial state.

Step 3 — Examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the context, the next state after the initial is event2, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication with antecedent C1. Since C1 is false, the implication is true (an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true).

- C2 is ""(Event1 happens and Event3 happens) OR Event3 happens.""

Step 2 — simplify the hypothesis:
- (E1 ∧ E3) ∨ E3 is logically equivalent to E3 (since E3 alone makes the disjunction true).

Step 3 — use the premises:
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" So E3 is true.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology: p → p is always true whenever interpreted pointwise (if p holds at a point, then p holds at that point).
2. The context only restricts what events can follow others (and says event1 already happened initially), but it does not create any counterexample to the tautology in C1.
3. Therefore C1 holds in every possible state/trace of the system, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is true.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (a conditional p → p)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is true in all situations (given the context).

Step 2 — Examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So event1 is terminal.)
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Reason about C1
- The statement ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true whenever p is true, and vacuously true when p is false.
- Given the context, event1 does happen initially, so the antecedent holds and the consequent holds as well, so C1 is true in the actual situation.
- More generally, C1 does not depend on any of the context constraints; p → p is true in every possible state.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2
- Because C1 is a tautology, it holds in all states (i.e., it ""always holds"").

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (This is of the form A → A.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is true in all situations given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions / context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, the system stops progressing.)
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about C1
- C1 is a logical tautology: any statement of the form A → A is always true (if A holds then A holds; if A does not hold the implication is vacuously true).
- In the given context, there is at least one state where event1 happened (the initial state), and in that state C1 holds. In states where event1 does not happen, the implication A → A is still true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because C1 is a tautology, it holds in every possible state reachable under the given context. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (formally: event3 → event3)
   - C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" (formally: event3 → C1)

2. Examine C1:
   - Any statement of the form p → p is a tautology (always true). So C1 is true regardless of the context or the sequence of events.

3. Examine C2:
   - C2 is the implication event3 → C1. Since C1 is true, the implication event3 → C1 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true in classical logic).
   - Also, the context even gives that event3 happens initially, so the antecedent of C2 is true; but because C1 is true, the whole implication is still true.

4. Conclusion:
   - C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: (event3) -> (event3).
- C2: (event3) -> C1.

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1 is a tautology (p -> p). It is true in every situation, independent of the given event constraints.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Since C1 is true unconditionally, C2 is equivalent to (event3) -> True, which is always true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event3 → event3).
- C2: (event3 → C1).

Step 2 — Examine C1:
- C1 is a logical tautology: any proposition implies itself. So C1 is true regardless of whether event3 actually occurs or of any context.

Step 3 — Examine C2:
- C2 says: if event3 happens, then C1 holds.
- Since C1 is always true, the implication (event3 → C1) is true regardless of the truth of event3 (an implication with a true consequent is always true).

Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- The hypothesis C2 is the conditional: ""If (C1) event2 does not happen, then event3 happens.""
- From the context, event3 happened initially. That is a fact independent of C1.
- Because event3 already happened, the consequent of the conditional (event3 happens) is true in every model of the context.
- Therefore the implication ""if event2 does not happen then event3 happens"" is true (the consequent holds regardless of the antecedent). Note also that C1 actually contradicts the requirement that after event3 event2 must happen, so C1 cannot hold in any model of the context—but even leaving that aside, event3 is true, so the conditional is true.

Thus C2 is True.
---
True.

Reasoning:
- From the context, event3 happened initially — so event3 does happen.
- C2 says: ""If event2 does not happen then event3 happens."" Whether or not event2 happens, event3 already occurred, so the implication is satisfied.
- (Even though ""event2 does not happen"" contradicts the rule that after event3 event2 must happen, that only makes the antecedent impossible; regardless, the consequent event3 is true, so the conditional is true.)
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event3 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. So event3 is true in the actual timeline.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So event2 also happens (it is required by the context).
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (irrelevant here, since event1 is not asserted).

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- C1 (event2 does not happen) contradicts the requirement that event2 must happen after the initial event3, so C1 cannot hold in any timeline consistent with the context.
- Even if we consider the hypothetical C1, the consequent (event3 happens) is already true because event3 happened initially.
- Thus the conditional “if C1 then event3” is true: its antecedent is impossible under the context and its consequent is already satisfied.

Final answer: True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (C1 = ""Event3 does not happen"".)

Step 2 — examine the given rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event3 happened initially and ""after event3 event1 must happen"", event1 will happen.
- Because ""after event1 event3 must happen"", event3 will happen again. So event3 does occur (indeed it already did), so C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false in the given situation.
- If event2 happens at any time, then by the rules: event2 -> event1 -> event3, so event3 will occur. That makes C1 false in any run where event2 happens.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts: if event2 happens then event3 does not happen. But if event2 happens, event3 does happen (by the chain event2 → event1 → event3). So the implication is false whenever event2 occurs.
- Nothing in the premises prevents event2 from occurring, so there are valid runs where event2 occurs and the implication fails. Also independently, C1 is already false because event3 happened initially.

- After event3, event1 must happen (so event1 will happen).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event3 will happen — already did).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 occurs).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event3 happened initially, C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 says: if event2 happens then event3 does not happen. For C2 to be true, whenever event2 happens the consequent must hold. But in any scenario where event2 happens, event3 has already happened (from the initial fact), so the consequent is false, making the implication false in that scenario.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: Event3 does not happen.
   - C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event2 happens then event3 does not happen).

2. Examine the given conditions:
   - Initially, event3 happened. So event3 does occur — C1 is already false.
   - After event3, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, event3 must happen.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.

3. Trace consequences:
   - Because event3 happened initially and event3 → event1 → event3, event3 occurs (and will recur).
   - If event2 happens, then event1 must happen (by the rule), and then that event1 forces event3 to happen. So any occurrence of event2 guarantees a later occurrence of event3, contradicting C1.

4. Conclusion:
   - C1 is false (event3 does happen).
   - C2 claims event2 implies event3 does not happen, but in fact event2 implies event3 will happen (and event3 already happened). Therefore C2 is false."

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpretations
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or Event3 happens"" (a proposition that holds whenever the current event is event2 or event3).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = at some time (now or in the future) event2 or event3 occurs.

2. Use the given constraints
- Initially event2 happened. So at time 0, event2 is true → C1 holds immediately.
- Even if “eventually” were interpreted as strictly future, the transition rules force that after any event1 you must get event2 or event3, and after event3 you get event1 which then leads to event2 or event3. Thus you cannot avoid event2/event3 forever after the start.

3. Conclusion
- Since C1 is already true at the initial moment (and in any interpretation is guaranteed to occur again), C2 is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point (now or in the future) event2 or event3 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So C1 is true at the initial moment already.
- Transition rules:
  - After event2: either event1 or event3 happens.
  - After event1: either event2 or event3 happens.
  - After event3: event1 happens.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Because event2 has already occurred initially, C1 holds immediately.
- Even if one demanded a strictly future occurrence after the initial moment: from event2 the next step is event1 or event3. If event3 occurs then C1 holds at that next step; if event1 occurs then the following step must be event2 or event3, so within at most two steps event2 or event3 occurs. Thus C1 is guaranteed to hold eventually.

Conclusion
C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the proposition ""Event2 happens or Event3 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some time in the execution, Event2 or Event3 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event2 happened. That means at the initial time C1 is already true.
- The transition rules only constrain what must happen after events, but they do not prevent C1 from holding now.

Step 3 — conclude
- Since C1 holds at the initial time, C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied immediately.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Short answer: True.

Reasoning (concise, non-sensitive summary):
- C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" The context explicitly states ""Initially, event2 happened,"" so C1 is false in every model of the given context.
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true in classical logic.
- Therefore, given the stated context, C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen (¬E2).
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens (¬E2 → E2).

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- The context states that initially event2 happened. So E2 is true (event2 does happen, at least initially). Hence C1 (¬E2) is false in the given context.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Alternatively, note that (¬E2 → E2) is logically equivalent to E2. Since E2 is true in the context, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Hypothesis C2 is the statement: ""If C1 holds (event2 does not happen), then event2 happens.""
2. From the given context, event2 happened initially. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false in the actual scenario described.
3. An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true: there is no situation consistent with the context where C1 is true and the consequent (event2 happens) is false.
4. Hence C2 is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there exists some future time at which event1 occurs).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. ""eventually (event1 will eventually happen)"". (In temporal-logic notation: C1 = F(event1), C2 = F(C1).)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 has happened.
- Rule A: after event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 forces a later occurrence of event1).
- Rule B: after event1, event2 must happen (forces a later event2 after any event1).
- Rule C: after event3, event2 must happen (not needed here but would force e2 after any e3).

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially, Rule A requires that event1 will occur at some later time. Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true.
- If C1 is already true now, then ""eventually C1 holds"" (C2) is also true — either because C1 already holds (so some time — now — witnesses it) or because generally F(F p) is equivalent to F p.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (in temporal logic: F event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (in temporal logic: F(F event1)). Note F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is logically the same as C1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from any point where event2 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 forces event2 later).
- After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant unless event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event2 has already happened, the rule ""after event2 → event1"" requires that event1 will occur at some future point. Thus C1 is true at the initial moment.
- Once event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1 → event2"" ensures event2 will occur again, and the pair of rules imply an alternating sequence (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...). So event1 not only eventually happens, it will happen repeatedly.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Since C1 (F event1) already holds, ""eventually C1"" (F(F event1)) also holds. Equivalently, C2 is true because C1 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. eventually it becomes true that Event1 will eventually happen)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant here unless event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event2 already happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur at some later time. Thus event1 does eventually happen — C1 is true.
- Once event1 happens, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" will force event2 again, and the two can alternate indefinitely. That does not invalidate C1.
- Since C1 is already true (it holds from the start/near future), ""eventually C1 holds"" (C2) is also true. (Note: in temporal logic, eventually(eventually P) is equivalent to eventually P; here eventually P already holds.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e., event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" You are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine C1
- The formula p → p is a logical tautology: it is true in every situation (true when p is true, and vacuously true when p is false). So C1 is universally valid by logic alone.
- The given context (event2 occurs initially and the events cycle 2 → 1 → 3 → 2) also guarantees event2 does occur, but that is unnecessary: even if event2 never happened, p → p would still be true.

Step 3 — conclusion about C2
- Since C1 is a tautology and thus always true, the statement ""C1 always holds"" is True.

Final answer: True

Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (logical form P → P)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — asking whether C1 is always true.

Examine C1:
- Any statement of the form P → P is a tautology (always true) in classical logic: it holds whether P is true or false (if P is false the implication is vacuously true; if P is true the consequent is true).

Trace the event sequence:
- The given temporal constraints (event2 → event1 → event3 → event2) do not affect the logical status of C1; they only describe dynamics, but C1 is true in every state regardless.

Conclusion:
- C1 is universally valid, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e. event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The question: is C2 True or False?

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is a logical implication of the form P → P. In standard logic this is a tautology: it is true for every possible truth value of P. So C1 is always true regardless of the event sequence.

Step 3 — consider the event sequence (context)
- The given cyclic requirements (event2 → event1 → event3 → event2, with event2 initially happening) do not affect the logical status of C1. Whether event2 occurs, repeats, or never occurs, the implication P → P remains true.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Hypothesis C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context, ""Initially, event2 happened"" and the rule ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Interpreting ""no other events can happen"" as meaning no events occur after event2, there can be no event occurrences in the next state. Thus C1 is false.
2. Hypothesis C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is false, and event1 cannot happen after event2 because the rule forbids any events after event2. Therefore event1 does not happen, so the disjunction is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event1 happens"", where C1 is ""event2 happens in the next state"".

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen; after event3 no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event2 happened initially, we are at a point after event2, and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids any further events in the next state.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in the next state (C1 is false), and event1 cannot happen after the initial event2 either.

Conclusion:
- Both disjuncts of C2 are false, so C2 is False.

False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""  
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred in the current/initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in the state following the one where event2 occurred, no events occur).
- Also: after event1, event3 must happen and after event3 no other events can happen — these are irrelevant if event1 cannot occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, the next state contains no events. Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen in the next state, and event1 cannot happen either.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- Event1 also does not happen.
- Therefore C2 = (C1 or event1) is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event1 occurs.
2. The rules say: after event1, event3 must happen; and after event3, event1 must happen. Interpreting ""after"" as the immediate next event, this forces an alternating sequence: event1, event3, event1, event3, ...
3. There is no point at which event2 can occur in that forced alternation, so event2 never happens. Thus C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true already (and forever).
4. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true as well (C1 holds immediately, so it certainly holds at some future time).
---

---
First, restate the hypotheses clearly:

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (read as: event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (read as: at some point in the future C1 is true — in particular, since C1 is a global negation, this is already satisfied if event2 never occurs at all.)

Now examine the given conditions:

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen. (This is repeated but is the same constraint.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (This is only a constraint that would apply if event2 ever occurs; it does not force event2 to occur.)

Trace the possible event sequence starting from the initial state:

- Time 0: event1 (given).
- By the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" → next is event3.
- By ""after event3, event1 must happen"" → next is event1.
- Then again event3, then event1, … so the system is forced into an infinite alternation 1,3,1,3, ...

At no point in that forced alternation is event2 allowed (no rule permits inserting event2 between the required 1↔3 transitions). The rule about ""after event2 ..."" is vacuous unless event2 ever happens; it does not create any path that produces event2.

Therefore event2 never occurs in any possible run starting from the given initial condition. So C1 is true (event2 does not happen), and hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is also true (indeed C1 holds immediately).

Final answer: True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the event rules.
- C1 is the statement ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (i.e. event3 → event3).

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The formula event3 → event3 is a tautology: it is true in any state (whether event3 occurs or not).

Step 3 — the next state:
- Initially event3 happened. By the rules, after event3 the next state must contain either event1 or event2.
- Regardless of which (event1 or event2) occurs at the next state, C1 (a tautology) is still true in that state.

Conclusion:
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is the proposition ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (i.e. event3 → event3).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine C1
- event3 → event3 is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in any state regardless of whether event3 is true or false.

Step 3 — consider the next state
- Because C1 is true in every state, it is certainly true in the next state (the transition rules and which events occur there are irrelevant).

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the formula ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a propositional implication of the form p → p.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- From event3 the system must go to either event1 or event2 next.
- From event1 the system must go to event3 next, etc.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in the next state:
- Interpreting C1 as the state formula p → p (i.e. ""event3 implies event3"" evaluated in the same state), p → p is a tautology and is true in every state. Therefore C1 holds in the next state regardless of which event (event1 or event2) actually occurs there.

(If C1 were instead intended to mean ""if event3 now then event3 in the next state"" — i.e. p → X p — that would be a different formula and would be false here because after event3 the next state is event1 or event2, not event3. But the given text reads as p → p.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. at every point in every run, C1 is true (equivalently: always eventually event1, G F event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so C1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- The other rules (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event2 → event1) are irrelevant because once event1 has happened initially, no further events can occur.

Step 3 — trace the possible execution
- Execution: event1 occurs initially, then the system reaches a terminal state with no future events.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 is true at the initial state (event1 already occurred).
- But at the subsequent terminal state (after event1), there will be no future occurrence of event1, so ""event1 eventually happens"" evaluated from that later state is false.
- Therefore C1 does not hold at every point in the run, so ""C1 always holds"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e. at some point now or later event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. at every point in time, it is true that event1 will eventually occur).

Step 2 — what the conditions say
- Initially, event1 happened (so C1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once that initial event1 has occurred, there are no further events ever).
- The other rules about event2/3 are irrelevant because no events can occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — trace-based reasoning
- At time 0 event1 has occurred, so C1 is true at time 0.
- At any later time there are no events (so event1 will not occur in the future from those later times). Thus at those later times ""event1 eventually happens"" is false.
- C2 requires C1 to hold at every time point; because C1 is false at the times after the initial event, C2 does not hold.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Interpreted as: from a given point in an execution, there is some (current or future) position where event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Interpreted as: at every point of every execution, C1 is true (i.e., from every point event1 will eventually occur).

Given the facts:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Consider the point immediately after that initial event1. There are no further events possible, so from that point there is no (current or future) occurrence of event1. Thus C1 is false at that point. Since C2 requires C1 to hold at every point, C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
C2 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 states: ""Event2 does not happen."" That is false in the initial state because the context says event2 happened initially.
- C2 states: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state.
- From the context, after event2 the next required event is event3. So in the next state event3 happens, and event2 does not happen there.
- Therefore in the next state the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is true, so C2 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state, event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So in the initial state C1 is false (event2 does happen there).
- After event2, event3 must happen — so the next state has event3 occurring.
- After event3, event1 must happen; after event1 no events can happen. Nothing indicates event2 occurs again.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Initial state: event2 occurs → C1 is false now.
- Next state: event3 occurs (not event2) → so in that next state, event2 does not happen → C1 is true in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — Understand the context and transition rules:
- Initially (current state S0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen → in the next state S1, event3 occurs.
- After event3, event1 must happen → in S2, event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen → S3 has no events.

Step 3 — Evaluate C2:
- In S1 (the next state after the initial one), event3 happens; event2 does not happen in S1.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is true in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are given a sequence constraint and two claims:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event3 must happen. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- C1: Event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state).

Step-by-step:
1. ""Initially event2 happened"" means at the current state (call it state0) event2 occurred.
2. The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces that in the next state (state1) the event must be event1.
3. Therefore event2 cannot happen in the next state (state1).
4. So C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not C1).

Step 2 — apply the context rules starting from the initial state:
- Initially event2 happened (call this state 0).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ⇒ state 1 must be event1.
- Therefore the next state after the initial state is event1, not event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event2 in the next state) is false.
- C2, being the negation of C1, is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., immediately after the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does NOT happen in the next state).
You are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (call that state 0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state, state 1, event1 must occur).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so state 2: event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so state 3: event1 or event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From state 0 (event2) the rule forces state 1 to have event1. Therefore, the next state after the initial event2 is event1, not event2.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false under the normal (single-event-per-state) reading.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""event2 does not happen"" AND ""event3 happens"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Initially event3 happened (given).
- The rule ""After event3, event2 must happen"" means that once event3 occurs, event2 must occur afterward.
- Because event3 did occur initially, event2 must occur. Therefore the statement ""event2 does not happen"" (C1) is impossible.
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event3 to happen. Although event3 does happen, C1 is false, so C2 cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C2 (""Event2 does not happen"" and ""event3 happens"") can be true given the rules.

Step-by-step:
- Hypothesis: C2 = (C1 and event3), where C1 = ""Event2 does not happen"".
- From the context: initially event3 happened.
- Rule: after event3, event2 must happen. Since event3 did occur, this rule requires that event2 happens later.
- That contradicts C1 (""Event2 does not happen""), so C1 is false.
- If C1 is false, C2 (which requires C1) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 = (C1 holds) AND (event3 happens).
- C1 = ""Event2 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen (so from any occurrence of event3, event2 will occur afterward).

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Since event3 happened initially, the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur.
- That contradicts C1 (""event2 does not happen""), so C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires C1 to hold; since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event3 did happen).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify C2:
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- So C2 claims: whenever event2 occurs, the very next state has event3.

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So from initial: event1 → event2.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (Non-deterministic choice: next can be event1 OR event3.)
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample trace:
- Start: event1 (initial).
- Next: event2 (required by the rule after event1).
- After that event2, the rules allow either event1 or event3. Choose event1. So the next state after event2 is event1, not event3.

In this trace event2 occurs but C1 (that event3 happens in the next state) is false. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — i.e., whenever event2 occurs, the next state must have event3.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially: event1 occurs.
- After event1 → event2 must happen (so event1 is always followed by event2).
- After event2 → either event1 or event3 must happen (non-deterministic choice).
- After event3 → event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: event1 (initial).
- After that: event2 (forced by after event1 → event2).
- After this event2, the rule allows either event1 or event3 next.
  - Choice A: next = event1. Then sequence is event1 → event2 → event1 → … (event3 never occurs here).
  - Choice B: next = event3. Then sequence is event1 → event2 → event3 → event2 → … (event3 does occur after that event2).

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Because after event2 the system is allowed to choose event1 instead of event3, there exists a valid execution where event2 is followed by event1 (so event3 does not happen next). C2 asserts that event3 must always happen next after event2; that is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e. whenever event2 happens, event3 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially: event1 happens.
- After event1: event2 must happen (so event1 -> next event2).
- After event2: either event1 or event3 must happen (so event2 -> next event1 OR next event3).
- After event3: event2 must happen (so event3 -> next event2).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event1, the next state must be event2 (by the rule after event1).
- From that event2, the rule allows two possibilities for the next state: event1 OR event3.
- It is therefore possible that after event2 the next state is event1 (not event3). E.g. sequence: event1 -> event2 -> event1 ... is allowed.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because after event2 it is allowed to go to event1 instead of event3, C1 (event3 next) is not guaranteed whenever event2 happens. Thus C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: (event3 → event3). This is a tautology (always true).
- C2: (C1 → event2). So C2 is ""if C1 holds then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1 holds (it is true in all models).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 given the context
- Since C1 is true, C2 reduces to checking whether event2 happens.
- The context states: ""Initially, event2 happened."" Therefore event2 does indeed happen.
- Thus the antecedent C1 is true and the consequent event2 is true, so the implication C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautology (always true).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" So C2 asserts that because C1 is true, event2 must occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 does occur in the scenario.)
- The other rules (after event2 → event3 must happen, after event3 → either event1 or event2, after event1 → no further events) do not prevent event2 from occurring — in fact they require event3 after event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C1 is true (tautology), so the antecedent of C2 holds.
- The consequent of C2 is ""event2 happens,"" and the context explicitly states event2 happened initially.
- Therefore the implication in C2 is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (a conditional of the form p → p)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (i.e. C1 → event2)
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true in the scenario (it occurred at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 would be terminal)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 is a tautology: p → p is always true. So C1 holds (no model dependence).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication (C1 → event2). Since C1 holds, C2 is true exactly when ""event2 happens"" is true.
- From the context we know event2 did happen initially. Therefore the consequent ""event2 happens"" is true, so the implication C1 → event2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"". So we must decide whether it's true that ""Event3 happens and Event2 happens"" does not hold.

Step 2 — the rules:
- Initially, Event3 happened.
- After Event3, Event2 must happen.
- After Event2, Event3 must happen.
- (After Event1 either Event2 or Event3 must happen — irrelevant here since Event1 is not mentioned.)

Step 3 — trace the implications:
- Because Event3 happened initially, the rule ""after Event3, Event2 must happen"" requires that Event2 happens.
- Because Event2 happens, the rule ""after Event2, Event3 must happen"" requires that Event3 happens (again or later).
- Thus both Event3 and Event2 do happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event3 happens and Event2 happens"") is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., not (event3 and event2)).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (So because event3 did happen, event2 must occur.)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (That will make event3 occur again, which in turn requires event2 again, etc.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 is not stated to have happened).

Step 3 — trace events:
- We know event3 has happened initially.
- That triggers the requirement that event2 must happen.
- Thus both event3 and event2 occur (and in fact they force each other to continue occurring).

Conclusion:
- C1 is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False

- C1: (event3 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2: NOT C1 (i.e., it is not the case that both event3 and event2 happen).

- Initially, event3 happened → event3 happens is true.
- After event3, event2 must happen → since event3 did happen, event2 must (and therefore does) happen.
- The other rules (after event2 → event3, after event1 → event2 or event3) are consistent but not needed further.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which simplifies to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. ""Event2 happens in the next state"".
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So from the initial state, the next state must have event2.
- Other conditions (after event2 → event3 must happen; after event3 → no other events) do not prevent event2 from occurring in the next state.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Since event1 holds initially and event2 is required after event1, event2 must hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 states: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2 states: ""C1 holds in the next state."" So C2 asserts that Event2 holds in the state immediately following the current one.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (we start in a state where event1 has occurred).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This requires that following the state where event1 occurred, event2 occurs subsequently (in the next state in the usual reading of ""after"").
- ""After event2, event3 must happen.""
- ""After event3, no other events can happen.""

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Starting from the initial state (event1): by the ""after event1"" rule, event2 must happen next.
- Therefore the immediate next state contains event2 (so C1 is true in that next state).
- Subsequent rules then force event3 after event2 and then termination, but those do not contradict the fact that event2 holds in the next state.

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.

- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. ""Event2 happens in the next state.""

- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" ⇒ event2 must occur in the next state.
- The other rules (after event2 → event3; after event3 → no further events) do not prevent event2 from happening in the next state.

3) Trace/reason:
- Since event1 occurred initially and event2 must follow event1, event2 indeed occurs in the next state. That makes C1 true in the next state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e. at some state s, the immediate successor state s+1 has event2)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. there exists some future state where C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial state event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no future state can have any events (including event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen — but event1 can never occur because event2 already happened initially and prevents any further events.
- After event3, no other events can happen — irrelevant because event3 never occurs.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Every run starts with event2 at the initial state, and then no further events occur in any future state.
- Therefore there is no state that has a successor state in which event2 occurs (no future state contains event2).

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- C1 is false at the initial state and at every state (no next state contains event2).
- Hence there is no future state where C1 holds, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F X event2).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen — event2 makes the trace terminal (no further event occurrences).
- After event1, event2 must happen — irrelevant because event1 cannot occur (terminal after event2).
- After event3, no other events can happen — irrelevant here.

Trace/reason:
- The only occurrence of event2 is at the initial state. There is no later state in which event2 occurs.
- C1 (X event2) is false at the initial state because the next state does not have event2.
- For C2 to be true, there must exist some state in the future whose next state contains event2. No such state exists because event2 never occurs except initially (and that initial occurrence has no predecessor whose ""next"" is that initial state).

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
First, identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point there is a state where event2 occurs in the next state).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So the initial state already has event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So any state where event2 has happened is terminal (no successor state with an event).
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 could occur, then the following state would have event2.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Event3-states are also terminal.)

Reasoning about event sequences:
- The initial state has event2 and is terminal, so there is no successor state in which event2 could ""happen in the next state."" Therefore C1 is false at the initial state.
- Since the initial state is terminal, no further states are reachable, so there is no later point at which C1 could become true.
- Although event1 would force event2 in the next state, event1 cannot occur after the initial event2 because ""after event2, no other events can happen.""

Conclusion:
C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event3 → event3). This is a tautology (whenever event3 holds, event3 holds).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” (i.e. X C1).

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” So from the initial state there is no successor state.
- (Other constraints about event2/event3 are irrelevant because no further events can occur after the initial state.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true in any state (it’s a tautology).
- C2 requires a next state to evaluate C1 there. Under the standard “next” semantics (X φ is true only if a successor exists and φ holds there), X C1 is false at a state with no successor.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 is the formula ""if event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (p → p). That is a propositional tautology — it is true in every state regardless of whether event3 occurs.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Whether or not there is any event in the next state (and the context actually makes event3 impossible after event1), C1 remains true there because p → p holds even when p is false.
- Therefore C2 is True.
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is the formula ""if event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (a propositional tautology).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., the next-state operator applied to C1).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the initial state is terminal (no successor).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so event3 would be followed by event2, then stop).

Reasoning about the hypothesis:
- C1 (A → A) is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C2 requires a successor state in which C1 holds. But the initial state has event1 and, by the given rule, no successor state exists after event1. In standard temporal semantics the ""next"" operator is not satisfied at a state with no successor (i.e., X φ is false if there is no next state).

Therefore C2 is not satisfied in the initial state (there is no next state to satisfy C1), so the correct answer is:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state."" So we must check whether, in the state immediately after the initial state, either Event1 or Event2 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transitions:
- Initially, Event3 happened.
- After Event3, Event2 must happen. (So in the next state Event2 occurs.)
- Also: after Event2, Event1 must happen (in the state after that), and after Event1, Event2 must happen (in the subsequent state). Those latter two only affect later states.

Step 3 — reason about the next state:
- From the initial Event3, the rule ""after Event3, Event2 must happen"" forces Event2 in the next state.
- Therefore in the next state Event2 happens, so ""Event1 or Event2"" (C1) is true there.

Conclusion:
C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially (current state S0): event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen ⇒ in the next state S1, event2 occurs.
- Other rules (after event2 → event1; after event1 → event2) only affect further states but are not needed here.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- S0: event3.
- S1 (next state): by the rule after event3, event2 occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 in S1:
- In S1, event2 happens, so ""event1 or event2"" is true in S1. Therefore C1 holds in the next state.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e. in a given state, either event1 or event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the successor state, either event1 or event2 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the state after that will have event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (they alternate thereafter).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Initial state: event3.
- Next state: by the rule after event3, event2 occurs.
- Thus in that next state event2 is true, so C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true in that next state.

Conclusion:
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asks whether ""C1 (event3 eventually happens)"" is true in the next state (i.e., from the state immediately after the initial one).

Step 2 — conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so the immediate next state contains event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace/reasoning
- From the initial state (where event2 has just happened), the next state must be one where event3 occurs (by the second condition).
- In that next state event3 has occurred now; and furthermore by the rules after that there will be another event1 or event2, both of which lead back to event3. So from the next state, event3 will occur (now and again later): hence ""event3 eventually happens"" holds in the next state.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the successor state, event3 will eventually happen.

Step 2 — understand the rules (conditions):
- Initially event2 happened (call that state 0).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so from state0, event3 will occur at some future point — in discrete-step reading, at the next step).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- From the initial state0 (event2), rule forces event3 next (or eventually) ⇒ state1: event3.
- After that, state2 is either event1 or event2. If event1, then by its rule state3 must be event3; if event2, by its rule state3 must be event3. So event3 recurs (state1, state3, ...).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asks whether, in the next state (i.e., the state right after the initial event2), C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") holds.
- In that next state event3 either has just happened or is guaranteed to happen by the rules — in either reading, there is some time j ≥ next state where event3 holds. Thus C1 is true in the next state.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the immediate next state, event3 will eventually happen.
You ask whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- From the initial state (event2), the next state must be event3 (by the second rule).
- Consider the next state (where event3 holds). From that state:
  - The system must go to either event1 or event2.
  - If it goes to event1, then by the fourth rule event3 must happen next.
  - If it goes to event2, then by the second rule event3 must happen next.
- In either case, starting from the next state (event3), event3 will occur again within at most two steps (indeed it already holds in that next state).

Step 4 — conclude
- Therefore from the next state, event3 does eventually happen (it holds immediately and recurs). So C1 is true in the next state.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., ¬(Event2 ∧ Event1)).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about whether event1 can happen:
- If event1 happened before event2, then by ""after event1, no other events can happen"" event2 could not have happened — but we are told event2 did happen initially. Contradiction.
- If event1 happened after event2, then event3 is required to happen after event2. But event1 would forbid any events after it, preventing the required event3 — contradiction.
- Simultaneous occurrence is not allowed by the given sequential ""after"" relations; any placement of event1 either prevents event2 or prevents the required event3.

Therefore event1 cannot have happened at any time, while event2 did happen. So C1 is false, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2 asserts: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not (event2 and event1)).

We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has occurred.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So once event2 occurs, event3 will occur later.
- After event3, no other events can happen. So event3 is terminal.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So event1 (if it occurs) is also terminal.

Step 3 — reason about possible timings for event1
- event1 cannot have happened before the initial moment because the initial fact is that event2 happened initially.
- If event1 were to occur after event2, then event3 must also occur after event2. For event1 to occur after event2 and not prevent event3, event1 would have to occur after event3 — but after event3 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur after event3 either.
- If event1 occurs between event2 and the required event3, that would prevent event3 (because after event1 no events can happen), contradicting ""after event2, event3 must happen.""
- Simultaneous occurrences do not avoid the contradiction: if event1 and event2 were simultaneous, event3 would still be required after event2 and thus after event1, contradicting ""after event1, no other events can happen.""

Conclusion
- There is no time at which event1 can occur without violating the given constraints. Therefore C1 (both event2 and event1 happen) is impossible, so C1 does not hold.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 occurs, it is terminal.)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event3 must occur after event2.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal.)

Step 3 — reason about possible timings of event1
- Could event1 have happened before event2? No: if event1 had happened, no other events could happen, but event2 did happen, so that is impossible.
- Could event1 happen after event2? No: after event2, event3 must happen; and after event3 no other events can happen. So there is no point after event2 at which event1 could occur without preventing the required event3.
- There is no consistent way for event1 to occur (neither before nor after event2), so event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 requires both event2 and event1. Event2 does happen but event1 does not, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Answer: True.

Brief justification (concise): C1 is the formula ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"", which is a tautology (always true). Since C1 is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs, the implication ""if event2 happens then C1 holds"" is also true.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis: C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""

2. Examine C1: The formula (event2 → event2) is a logical tautology (any proposition implies itself). It is true independently of whether event2 actually occurs.

3. Therefore C1 holds unconditionally (it is always true). C2 says ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — but since C1 is already true, the conditional is also true.

4. Formally: C1 ≡ True, so C2 ≡ (event2 → True) ≡ True.

So C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (“If event2 happens, then C1 holds”) is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1 and C2.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” This is a logical tautology (P → P). It is true in every case (whether event2 occurs or not).

Step 3 — examine C2
- C2 is “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” The consequent of C2 (C1) is already always true. A conditional with a true consequent is itself true regardless of the antecedent. Alternatively, if one reasons about possible event sequences: event2 may never occur, in which case the antecedent of C2 is false and the conditional is true by material implication. Either way, C2 is true.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point in time C1 is true)

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is the formula P → P with P = ""event2 happens"".
- In classical logic (and standard propositional/temporal semantics) P → P is a tautology: it is true in every state, regardless of whether P is true or false.

Step 3 — use that to evaluate C2
- Since C1 is true at every moment (including the initial moment), C1 certainly holds at some future time — in fact it holds always.
- Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (a self-implication)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds.""

Examine C1:
- The formula p → p is a tautology: it is true in every situation (it asserts nothing beyond p implying itself).
- Therefore C1 is true right away (at the initial state).

Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds (so it certainly holds at some future time).

Final answer: True
---
Identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (a conditional)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists a time in the future where C1 is true)

Examine conditions:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- (Rule about event1 is irrelevant because event1 never occurs here.)

Trace event sequence:
- Start: event3.
- By the rules this forces event2 next, then event3, then event2, etc. So the system alternates event3, event2, event3, ...

Evaluate C1:
- The formula ""event2 → event2"" is a tautology: it is true at any state (true when event2 holds; vacuously true when event2 does not hold). Therefore C1 holds at every time point in the run.

Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied immediately (indeed C1 always holds).

Final answer:

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2 says: if event1 happens, then C1 (event1 does not happen). Since C1 is true, the implication is true regardless of whether event1 happens (and in fact event1 does not happen, so the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true).

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
You are asked whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context. C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterward.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant because event1 never occurs in this scenario.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (Irrelevant because event3 does not occur given event2 already happened initially and blocks further events.)

Step 3 — Trace the event sequence
Because event2 happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, event1 does not happen. Therefore C1 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2
C2 is the implication: if event1 happens, then event1 does not happen. Since event1 does not happen in the actual scenario, the antecedent is false, so the implication is vacuously true. Also note A → ¬A is equivalent to ¬A, so because C1 is true, C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened, no event1 can ever happen afterward.
- Because event2 happened initially, event1 does not occur at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication (event1) → (event1 does not happen).
- Since C1 is true in the actual scenario, the implication is true (an implication with a true consequent is true). Equivalently, event1 does not happen, so the antecedent is false, making the implication vacuously true.

Sample responses:
C2 asserts that C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") holds at every state.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (so the trace stops after that occurrence).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so next is event1, not event3).
- After event1, next is either event2 or event3 (so event3 is only one possible next event).

Counterexamples show C1 is not always true:
- At the initial state event3 has just happened; because after event3 no other events can happen, the next state has no events, so event3 does not happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false at the initial state.
- After event2, the next event must be event1, so C1 is false after event2.
- After event1 the next event could be event2 instead of event3, so C1 is not guaranteed after event1.

Therefore C1 does not hold in all states, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (a statement about the immediate next state)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true at every state — i.e. in all states the next state has event3)

We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (This forbids any event after an occurrence of event3.)
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence starting from the initial state
- At the initial state event3 has occurred.
- The rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" means there are no events in any subsequent state following that initial event3. In particular the immediate next state cannot have event3 (or any event).
- Therefore C1 (""event3 happens in the next state"") is false at the initial state.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold in every state. We have found a state (the initial state) where C1 is false, so C2 is not true.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in all states / at all times).

Examine the context rules:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules: after event2 → event1 must happen; after event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen.)

Trace from the initial situation:
- Initially event3 happened. By the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"", there are no events that can occur after that initial event3. So in the very next state no event occurs, in particular event3 does not occur in the next state. Therefore C1 is false in the initial situation.

Because C1 is already false in the initial state, it cannot be true ""always."" Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked:
   - C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some point (possibly now) C1 is true.

2. Understand the conditions:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
   - After event3, no other events can happen (event3 would be terminal).

3. Trace possible event sequences:
   - Start: event2 (given).
   - Then event1 must happen (given).
   - After event1 nothing else can happen, so the only actual finite sequence is event2 → event1 and then stop.
   - Event3 never occurs in any reachable continuation.

4. Evaluate C1 in these traces:
   - C1 is the conditional ""if event3 happens then event2 happens.""
   - Because event3 never happens in the actual trace, the conditional is vacuously true (there is no counterexample where event3 occurs without event2).
   - Therefore C1 holds now (and at all future points in the actual execution).

5. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true — C1 already holds immediately.

So the correct final answer is: True.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point C1 becomes true — here C1 is actually true already).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 must occur at some future time).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is also terminal).

Reasoning about possible traces:
- Since event2 has already happened, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur at some later point.
- If event3 were to occur before event1, then because ""after event3 no other events can happen"" event1 could not occur, contradicting the obligation that event1 must follow event2. Therefore event3 cannot occur at any time before event1.
- Event3 cannot occur after event1 either, because ""after event1 no other events can happen.""
- Hence event3 cannot occur at any point in any valid execution that respects the constraints. So event3 never happens.

Conclusion about C1 and C2:
- C1 (""if event3 happens then event2 happens"") is vacuously true in all executions because event3 never happens. (Also independently, event2 did happen initially, so even if one tried to consider event3, event2 already holds.)
- Therefore C1 holds from the start, so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" (a conditional relating occurrences of events)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there will come a time when C1 is true; in particular if C1 is already true then C2 is satisfied)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so since event2 already happened, event1 will occur at some point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is also terminal).

Step 3 — trace allowed event sequences
- Because event2 already happened, any allowed execution must later have event1 (by the obligation).
- Once event1 happens, no further events may occur; therefore event3 cannot occur after event1.
- Could event3 occur before event1? No: if event3 occurred before event1, then no other events could happen after event3, which would prevent the required event1 after event2, violating the obligation. So any execution that respects the conditions cannot have event3 at any time.
- Conclusion: in all allowed executions, event3 never happens; event2 has happened (initially) and event1 will happen next and then stop.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""if event3 happens then event2 happens"") is true in all allowed executions: event3 never occurs (so the implication is vacuously true), and additionally event2 already did occur initially.
- Therefore C1 already holds, so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis C2 states: ""If event3 happens in the next state (C1), then event1 happens.""
- From the rules: after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. That is nondeterministic — event1 is one possible outcome, but event2 is also allowed.
- Therefore C1 does not guarantee event1; event2 could occur instead (and that would satisfy the rule).
- Even though in the actual scenario event1 already happened initially (so no further events can occur, making C1 impossible), that only makes the antecedent impossible — it does not make C2 a valid entailment of the system’s transition rules.
- Hence the implication ""C1 implies event1"" is not guaranteed by the given rules.

So C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (a conditional: if event3 happens next, then event1 happens)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once that initial event1 occurs, no further events are possible.)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Because the initial event1 occurred and after event1 no other events can happen, no event can occur in the next state. Therefore event3 cannot happen in the next state — C1 is impossible (false) under the given constraints.
- C2 is the implication ""if C1 then event1."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).

Final determination
- C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 then event1 happens."" C1 is ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- From the context: initially event1 happened, and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes the initial state terminal — no events (including event3) can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (the antecedent) is impossible / false in the given situation.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Hence C2 is True."

Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning
1. Context facts:
   - Initially event3 happened (so event3 is true in every allowed sequence).
   - After event3, event2 must happen → event2 happens (follows from event3).
   - After event2, no other events can happen → once event2 occurs, event1 cannot occur afterwards.
   - Also, there is no way for event1 to occur before the initial event3 (because event3 is stated to have happened initially).

2. Evaluate C1 (""If event1 happens, then event3 happens""):
   - In every valid sequence event3 already happened. Also, event1 cannot occur (it cannot be before the initial event3 and cannot occur after event2). So either way, the implication ""if event1 then event3"" is true in all models (either vacuously because event1 never occurs, or because event3 does occur).

3. Evaluate C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds""):
   - Event2 does happen (from step 1). C1 holds in all valid sequences (step 2). Therefore the conditional ""if event2 then C1"" is true.

Hence C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens."" (an implication about occurrences)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" i.e., event2 → (event1 → event3).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. So event3 is true in every allowed timeline (it already happened).
- After event3, event2 must happen → event2 will occur (following the initial event3).
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is terminal.
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must follow).

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- Because event3 happened initially in all timelines, any timeline in which event1 happens also has event3 (event3 already occurred). Thus C1 is true in every model consistent with the context.
- C2 says ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds."" But C1 already holds universally, so whenever event2 happens (and in fact event2 does happen after the initial event3), C1 is true. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context facts:
  1. Initially event3 happened (so event3 is true in every allowed sequence).
  2. After event3, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur).
  3. After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
  4. After event1, event2 must happen.

- C1 says: if event1 happens then event3 happens. Because event3 already happened initially in all allowed executions, C1 is satisfied in every execution (event3 has occurred regardless of whether event1 occurs). Thus C1 is entailed by the context.

- C2 says: if event2 happens then C1 holds. Since C1 already holds (as shown above), C2 is also true — the implication ""event2 → C1"" is satisfied.

Therefore C2 is True."

- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Also event1 and event3 are terminal if they occur, but that doesn't matter since they haven't occurred.

- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event3, no other events can happen; after event1, no other events can happen — these are additional constraints but not needed here.)

Step 3 — Trace and reasoning:
- Since event2 happened initially and the rule says ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" there cannot be any next event after that initial state.
- Therefore event3 cannot happen in the next state; C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold; since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds (Event3 always happens), then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 is true in the given scenario.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has happened initially, nothing can happen afterward — in particular event3 and event1 cannot occur after that.)
- Also: after event3, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen. (These are irrelevant to whether event2 happened, because event2 is already given as having happened initially.)

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- Event2 already holds from the context, so in every model satisfying the context event2 is true.
- Therefore ""If C1 then event2"" is true: regardless of whether C1 is possible or not, event2 holds anyway. (If C1 were impossible, the implication would be vacuously true; if C1 were possible, event2 still holds.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What’s being asked
We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur in every allowed execution.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus nothing can occur after the initial event2.
- Because event2 happens initially and blocks further events, event3 cannot occur in any valid execution.
- The rules about event3 → event1 and event1 blocking further events are irrelevant because event3 never happens.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false in this context (event3 cannot happen because event2 already occurred and prevents any further events).
- C2 is the conditional ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" But event2 already happens (initially) in every allowed execution. Therefore the conditional is true: the consequent (event2 happens) holds regardless of whether the antecedent holds. (Also: classically, the conditional would be vacuously true because C1 is false.)

Conclusion
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The context states: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 does happen (right away), and no further events can occur after that.
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is actually false given the context, because once event2 has happened initially, no other events (including event3) can ever occur.
- C2 is the conditional: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Regardless of whether C1 is true or false, event2 does happen in the given context (it happened initially). Therefore the conditional is satisfied: whenever C1 holds (even if that assumption is inconsistent with the context), the consequent (event2 happens) is true.
- Thus C2 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold"" where C1 = ""Event3 happens and event1 happens.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. => event3 occurs.
- After event3, event1 must happen. => event1 occurs.
(Other rules do not prevent these.)

Step 3 — conclude:
- Both event3 and event1 happen, so C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis: C2 asserts that ""Event3 happens and event1 happens"" (C1) does not hold.

Step 2 — apply conditions to the initial state:
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- From ""after event2, event3 must happen"" we get that event3 must occur.
- From ""after event3, event1 must happen"" we get that event1 must occur.

Thus both event3 and event1 do happen, so C1 holds.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify what’s asked
- C2 says “C1 does not hold.” So we must decide whether C1 (Event3 happens AND Event1 happens) is false. If C1 is true then C2 is false; if C1 is false then C2 is true.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (So event3 will occur after the initial event2.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (So event1 will occur after event3.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (This only ensures continued progression but doesn’t prevent event1 or event3 from happening earlier.)
- The duplicate “After event3, event1 must happen” is the same constraint twice and adds no new information.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- Start: event2 happened.
- By the rule “after event2, event3 must happen” ⇒ event3 happens.
- By the rule “after event3, event1 must happen” ⇒ event1 happens.

Thus both event3 and event1 do happen.

Step 4 — Conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (Event3 happens and Event1 happens) is true.
- Therefore C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1 asserts ""Event1 happens"" (redundant conjunction).
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., ""Event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — Examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (one of them will occur).
- If event3 happens, no further events occur.
- If event1 happens, then after it either event2 or event3 must happen (so event1 is allowed).

Step 3 — Reasoning about possible sequences:
- One possible sequence is event2 → event3 (so event1 does not occur).
- Another possible sequence is event2 → event1 → ... (so event1 does occur).
Thus event1 may happen in some allowed sequences and may not in others.

Conclusion:
- C1 is not guaranteed (it may or may not hold).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not necessarily true. The correct answer to ""C2 is True or False?"" is:

False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 says ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — effectively C1 asserts that event1 happens.
- C2 is the negation: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ""event1 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (a choice).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (a choice).
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- One possible sequence: event2 → event1 → ... (so event1 does happen, making C1 true and C2 false in that branch).
- Another possible sequence: event2 → event3 and then stop (so event1 does not happen, making C1 false and C2 true in that branch).

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid sequence where event1 does happen and another where it does not, we cannot conclude that ""event1 does not happen"" is always true.
- Therefore C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 says “Event1 happens and event1 happens” (i.e., event1 happens).
- C2 says “C1 does not hold” (i.e., event1 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no further events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- One valid sequence: event2 → event1 → ... (so event1 does happen).
- Another valid sequence: event2 → event3 (so event1 does not happen).

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because the context allows a sequence where event1 happens and also a sequence where it does not, C1 is not guaranteed true but is also not ruled out.
- C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is therefore not entailed by the context.

True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, initially event3 happened and ""after event3, event2 must happen"" — so from the initial state event2 will occur; C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state (immediately after the initial one) is the state where event2 has occurred (because event2 must happen after event3). From that next state, event2 is already true at that state, so ""event2 eventually happens"" holds there as well (event2 holds at the current/next state itself). The fact that ""after event2, no other events can happen"" does not prevent C1 from holding in that state since event2 has already occurred.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- The context says ""After event3, event2 must happen."" Interpreting ""after"" as the immediate next event, the next transition from the initial state is event2.
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true in the initial state (event2 does happen next).
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state. The next state is the one reached after event2. In that state event2 has already happened and, by ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" there will be no further occurrences of event2. So from that next state, event2 does not ""eventually happen"" (it already occurred in the past and won't occur again).
- Therefore C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide if the statement C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the context.
- C1 is: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (event2 ∧ event1).
- So C2 is the implication: event2 → (event2 ∧ event1), equivalently event2 → event1.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true in the actual history.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened (and it already has), no further events can occur later.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (irrelevant here except to note event2 would be terminal if it occurred).
- ""After event3, event1 must happen."" (irrelevant to C2).

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot actually occur after that initial event. So in the actual scenario event2 does not occur.
- Two ways to evaluate C2:
  1. Since event1 is already true, if event2 were to occur, event1 would still be true — so event2 → event1 holds.
  2. Alternatively, if event2 is impossible, the implication event2 → (event2 ∧ event1) is vacuously true when the antecedent cannot occur.

Conclusion
- In either reading, the implication C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" With C1 = (event2 happens AND event1 happens), C2 is the implication: event2 → (event2 ∧ event1). This is equivalent to event2 → event1 (because event2 → (event2 ∧ event1) iff event2 → event1).

Step 2 — what the context gives:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true in every allowed scenario (it has occurred).
- The other rules (after event1 nothing can happen; after event2 nothing can happen; after event3 event1 must happen) do not contradict that event1 has happened; they only constrain what can follow. In particular, event1's being true is not negated anywhere.

Step 3 — evaluate the implication:
- Since event1 is true in all models (it happened initially), the implication event2 → event1 is always satisfied (either event2 doesn't happen — vacuous truth — or event1 does happen because it already happened initially). Therefore C2 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — restate hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. event2 → (event2 ∧ event1), equivalently event2 → event1)

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once that initial event1 has occurred, no event2 can occur afterwards — in effect event2 cannot occur at all in any allowed sequence.
- Also, event1 is true (it happened initially).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true. Since event2 cannot occur given the facts, ""if event2 happens then …"" is true.
- Equivalently, because event1 already happened, any situation in which event2 happened would also have event1 true, so event2 → event1 holds.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does NOT always happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
(One ""after event2"" line is duplicated; it doesn't change anything.)

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Because initially event1 happened and after event1 event2 must happen, a valid execution is: event1 → event2 → end.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so nothing can occur after that.
- The rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" only applies if event3 occurs; it does not force event3 to occur.

Thus there exists a valid execution (initial event1 then event2, then end) in which event3 never happens. Therefore event3 does not always happen, so C1 is false.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event3 always happens."" So C2 is true iff event3 is NOT guaranteed to happen in every valid sequence.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).
- The rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" is only relevant if event3 occurs; it does not force event3 to occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial condition we get event1 → event2, and then the trace ends (event2 is terminal).
- This trace contains no event3, and it satisfies all constraints.

Conclusion
- There exists a valid trace with no event3, so event3 does not always happen. Therefore C1 is false and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not always happen).
You ask whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (this only constrains sequences in which event3 occurs).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- A valid sequence that satisfies all constraints is: event1 (initial) → event2 → stop. This respects ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen."" The rule about ""after event3 ..."" is irrelevant because event3 never occurs in this sequence.
- Since such a valid sequence exists in which event3 does not occur, event3 is not guaranteed to always happen.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, so C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point either event1 or event2 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So at the initial moment event2 is true.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So once event2 has occurred, event1 will occur subsequently.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (Irrelevant here unless event3 occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially, C1 (event1 or event2) is already true at the initial moment.
- ""Eventually"" includes the present moment (if a property holds now, it is also true that it holds eventually). Moreover, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees event1 will occur after the initial event2 anyway.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Hypothesis: C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 = ""event1 happens or event2 happens"".
- From the context: initially event2 happened. That means C1 already holds at the initial point (because event2 has happened).
- Therefore C1 holds immediately, so C1 indeed ""eventually"" holds.
- The other rules (after event2 → event1 must happen; after event1 → no further events; after event3 → event1 or event2) do not prevent C1 from holding; they only constrain later behavior.

So C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- Hypothesis: C2 asserts that ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 = ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- Conditions:
  - Initially, Event2 happened (so C1 already holds at the initial time).
  - After Event2, Event1 must happen (so Event1 will occur at some later point).
  - After Event1, no other events can happen.
  - The rule about Event3 is irrelevant because Event3 never occurred in the given trace.
- Trace: Event2 occurred initially, and because of the rule ""after Event2, Event1 must happen"", Event1 will occur thereafter; once Event1 occurs nothing else can happen.
- Conclusion: Since Event2 has already happened (and Event1 will happen soon), C1 holds (in fact at the initial moment and later), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Therefore C2 is True."

Sample responses:
We ask: does ""Event1 eventually happens"" hold in the next state (i.e., after the initial event2)?

Given:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

From the next state (right after the initial event2) there are two possible immediate moves:
1. Next is event1 → then event1 has occurred (so ""event1 eventually happens"" is true).
2. Next is event3 → by the rule after event3, event1 must happen afterward (so event1 will occur eventually).

In both possible cases from the next state, event1 is guaranteed to occur eventually. Therefore C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initial condition: at time 0 event2 occurred.
- Rules:
  - After event2, the next event is either event1 or event3.
  - After event3, event1 must occur (so event1 will occur eventually after a state with event3).
  - After event1, event2 must occur.

- C1 says ""event1 eventually happens"" from the initial state. From initial event2, either the next event is event1 (so event1 immediately happens) or it is event3 (and then event1 must occur afterwards). So C1 is true.

- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from every possible next state, event1 eventually happens.
  - If the next state is event1, then event1 has already occurred (so ""event1 eventually happens"" is true).
  - If the next state is event3, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" ensures event1 will occur later (so ""event1 eventually happens"" is true).

In all possible next states C1 holds, so C2 is True.
---
First, identify the question: C2 asserts that ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the state immediately after the initial state, it is guaranteed that event1 will eventually happen.

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (so in the next state we have either event1 or event3).
- If the next state is event1: from that state, after event1 comes event2, and after that either event1 or event3; in either case event1 will occur again (if event3 occurs then event1 must follow). So from a state with event1, event1 is guaranteed to occur again eventually.
- If the next state is event3: after event3 event1 must happen (so event1 occurs immediately next).

Thus in both possible next states (event1 or event3) event1 is guaranteed to happen eventually. Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens (event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: if event1 happens, then C1 holds (event1 → (event1 ∨ event2)).

Step 2 — Logical form
- The implication event1 → (event1 ∨ event2) is a logical tautology: whenever event1 is true, the disjunction event1 ∨ event2 is necessarily true (because event1 itself makes the disjunction true). If event1 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Step 3 — Check against the context
- The context actually forbids event1 (initially event3 happened and after event3 no other events can happen), so antecedent (event1 happens) is false in every allowed scenario, making the implication true as well. Either way (tautology or vacuous truth), C2 holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. event1 → (event1 ∨ event2))

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. Since event3 already happened initially, neither event1 nor event2 can ever occur.
- (The other statements — ""after event1, event3 must happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — are consistent but don't change that event1 and event2 cannot occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the implication P → (P ∨ Q) with P = ""event1 happens"". Logically, P → (P ∨ Q) is always true (if P is true then P ∨ Q is true; if P is false the implication is vacuously true).
- In this context P is in fact false (event1 cannot happen), so the implication is true by vacuity.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — clarify the statements
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" i.e. event1 → (event1 ∨ event2).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. So in the actual scenario, neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any time.
- (Also: after event1, event3 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen — these don't change the above impossibility given event3 already happened.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is false in the given scenario (neither event1 nor event2 can occur).
- C2 is the implication event1 → (event1 ∨ event2). This is logically valid: if event1 happens then certainly ""event1 or event2"" is true. Even given that event1 cannot actually occur here, the implication is true vacuously (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says “event2 eventually happens.” From the context, event2 happens initially, so C1 is true.
- C2 is the implication “if C1 holds, then event2 happens.” That is just saying “if event2 eventually happens, then event2 happens,” i.e. the consequent is the same fact asserted by the antecedent.
- An implication of the form (P → P) is always true, and here the antecedent is actually true (event2 already happened), so the implication holds.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context forces sequences starting with event2 (initially event2 happened), then event1, then either event2 or event3, etc. So event2 does occur (already at the initial point), hence C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true.
- C2 states: if C1 holds then event2 happens. Since C1 is precisely that ""event2 eventually happens,"" the implication is just ""if event2 eventually happens then event2 happens,"" which holds here (and in any trace where ""event2 eventually happens"" is true, event2 indeed happens). In the given context both antecedent and consequent are satisfied, so C2 is True.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Identify the statements:
  - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
  - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (i.e. C1 → event2 happens)

- Examine the conditions:
  - Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred at the start.
  - After event2, event1 must happen; after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen; if event3 happens, no further events occur.
  - From the initial event2, the future can either loop (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...) or go to event3 and stop. In every allowed trace event2 has already occurred (at the start).

- Evaluate C1 and C2:
  - C1 is true (event2 already happened).
  - C2 says ""if event2 eventually happens then event2 happens."" Since the antecedent is exactly that event2 happens, the implication is tautologically satisfied; and in this scenario the antecedent is true and the consequent is true as well.

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 states: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 states: ""Event3 always happens."" (i.e., in every possible execution/run, event3 occurs.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So every run must contain an occurrence of event3 (after the initial event1).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 can only occur immediately after an event3, and then the run ends).

Step 3 — trace possible runs
- Start: event1 (given).
- Because of ""after event1, event3 must happen"", event3 occurs next.
- After that event3 we have two options:
  - Choose event1 → then again event3 must follow, and the cycle can repeat (event3 occurs repeatedly).
  - Choose event2 → then the run ends (and event3 has already occurred just before event2).
- In every possible run, event3 occurs (at least once, and possibly repeatedly). So C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- If event2 happens in a run, that event2 must have been immediately after an event3 (by the rule after event3 either event1 or event2 must happen). So any run with event2 contains event3.
- Also, since C1 is true for all runs anyway, the implication ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the statements
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — meaning in every allowed sequence (run) event3 occurs.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — meaning whenever event2 occurs (in the system), then the global fact C1 is true.

Step 2 — use the conditions to enumerate possible runs
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So every run must contain event3 immediately after the initial event1.
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2.
  - If event3 → event1, the same rule forces another event3 afterwards, etc. So runs may loop event1↔event3 forever.
  - If event3 → event2, event2 is terminal (no further events).
- Therefore every allowed run contains event3 (at least once, right after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the claims
- C1 is true (every run contains event3).
- C2: since C1 is true unconditionally, the implication ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" is true. Also, any run that reaches event2 must have had event3 immediately before it, so event2-occurrence does not contradict C1.

Final answer: True.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Hypotheses: C1 = ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible execution trace). C2 = ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""

- From the context:
  - Initially event1 has happened.
  - After event1, event3 must happen — so in every trace there will be at least one event3.
  - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen — so event2 can only occur following an event3.
  - After event2 no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

- Therefore:
  - C1 is already guaranteed by the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" together with the initial event1.
  - Any trace that contains event2 must have had a preceding event3 (because event2 can only follow event3).

Thus if event2 happens, event3 has happened (and in fact event3 happens in every trace), so the implication in C2 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. event3 → (event3 does not happen))

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One valid sequence: event1 → event2 (then stop). In this trace event3 does not happen.
- Another valid sequence: event1 → event3 → event2 (then stop). In this trace event3 does happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is equivalent to ""if event3 happens then event3 does not happen,"" which is false in any trace where event3 happens.
- Since the context allows the trace event1 → event3 → event2 (where event3 does happen), there exists an allowed trace making the antecedent true and the consequent false. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event3 does not happen. (¬E3)
- C2: If event3 happens, then C1 holds. Formally C2 = (E3 → ¬E3).

Step 2 — examine the conditions from the context
- Initially E1 happened.
- After E1, either E2 or E3 must happen (so at least one of E2 or E3 occurs next).
- After E3, E2 must happen (so E3 → E2).
- After E2, no other events can happen (E2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Sequence A: E1 → E2. This is allowed and then stops. In this branch E3 does not happen (C1 true in this branch).
- Sequence B: E1 → E3 → E2. This is also allowed: after E1 you can pick E3, and after E3 you must do E2; after E2 nothing more happens. In this branch E3 does happen (C1 false in this branch).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 says: if E3 happens then ¬E3. But in Sequence B E3 happens and ¬E3 is false, so the implication (E3 → ¬E3) is false in that allowed sequence.
- Because the context permits a sequence where the antecedent is true and the consequent false, C2 is not entailed and is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds."" That is, C2 says: if event3 happens then event3 does not happen (an implication e3 → ¬e3).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (one of them must occur next).
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- From event1, one allowed sequence is: 1 → 2 (then stop).
- Another allowed sequence is: 1 → 3 → 2 (3 is allowed and then 2 must follow, then stop).

So event3 can happen in a valid sequence (the sequence 1 → 3 → 2).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 (e3 → ¬e3) is equivalent to ¬e3 (i.e., to C1). Because an implication P → ¬P is true exactly when P is false.
- Since the context allows a sequence where event3 does happen, C1 is not guaranteed/entailed, and therefore C2 is not guaranteed/entailed either.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: Event2 does not happen (¬E2).
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds, i.e. E3 ∨ ¬E2.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — given constraints
- E1 happened initially.
- After E1, either E2 or E3 must happen.
- If E2 happens, then E3 must happen afterward.
- After E3 happens, no further events can occur.

Step 3 — case analysis
- Case A: After E1, E3 happens. Then E3 is true, so E3 ∨ ¬E2 is true (C2 true). Also, once E3 occurs no further events (so E2 does not occur after E3).
- Case B: After E1, E2 happens. By the rule “after E2, event3 must happen,” E3 also happens. So E3 is true, hence E3 ∨ ¬E2 is true (C2 true), even though E2 did occur.

(If one interpreted “either … or …” as exclusive, the branch where E2 happens would force E3 as well and thus contradict exclusivity, leaving only the E3 branch — which still makes C2 true.)

Step 4 — conclusion
In every consistent scenario allowed by the constraints, C2 holds. Final answer:

True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C2 is the statement ""Event3 happens or (Event2 does not happen)"". We must decide whether C2 is true given the facts.

Step 2 — given facts:
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen.
- After Event2, Event3 must happen.
- After Event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason through possible sequences:
- From Event1, one must choose Event2 or Event3.
- If Event2 is chosen, then by the rule ""after Event2, Event3 must happen"", Event3 will also happen. So sequence Event1 → Event2 → Event3 includes Event3.
- If Event3 is chosen immediately, Event3 happens (and nothing follows).
- There is no allowed sequence where Event3 does not occur (because if you pick Event2 you are forced to Event3; if you pick Event3 you already have it).

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
Since in every allowed scenario Event3 happens, the disjunction ""Event3 happens or Event2 does not happen"" is true (the left disjunct is always true).

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step:

- Given: event1 happened.
- Premise A: After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- Premise B: After event2, event3 must happen.
- Premise C: After event3, no other events can happen.

Consider the two possibilities required by Premise A:
1. If event3 happens right after event1, then event3 happens — so C2 (""event3 happens or event2 does not happen"") is true.
2. If event2 happens after event1, then by Premise B event3 must occur afterward — so again event3 happens, making C2 true.

In all allowed sequences event3 happens. (C1 — “event2 does not happen” — may be false in the second case, but C2 is still satisfied because event3 occurs.)

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (a claim about the immediate next state from the current state)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, it is true that Event2 happens in *that next state's* next state)

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace states
- Initially (time 0): event1 happened.
- From ""After event1, event3 must happen"" → time 1: event3.
- From ""After event3, event2 must happen"" → time 2: event2.
- From ""After event2, event3 must happen"" → time 3: event3.
So the timeline is: time0: event1; time1: event3; time2: event2; time3: event3; … (oscillating 3,2,...)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial state
- C1 at time0: claims event2 happens in the next state (time1). But time1 has event3, so C1 is false at time0.
- C2 at time0: claims that in the next state (time1), C1 holds. At time1, the next state (time2) does have event2, so ""event2 happens in the next state"" is true at time1. Thus C1 is true at time1, so C2 is true at time0.

Step 2 — translate the conditions into a timeline (starting at the initial state t0)
- t0: event1 happened (given).
- ""After event1, event3 must happen"" ⇒ t1: event3.
- ""After event3, event2 must happen"" ⇒ t2: event2.
- ""After event2, event3 must happen"" ⇒ t3: event3, and so on alternating between event3 and event2 after t1.

So the timeline is: t0: event1, t1: event3, t2: event2, t3: event3, t4: event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C2 at the initial state t0
- C2 says: at t1 (the next state from t0), C1 must hold.
- At t1, C1 asserts that event2 happens in the next state (i.e., at t2).
- Indeed at t2 event2 occurs (from the timeline), so C1 is true at t1.
- Therefore C2 is true when evaluated at t0.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (X event2)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (X C1) — which is equivalent to saying event2 happens two states ahead (X X event2).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially (state0): event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen → state1: event3.
- After event3, event2 must happen → state2: event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen → state3: event3, and so on (they alternate).

Step 3 — trace the timeline
- state0: event1
- state1 (next): event3
- state2 (two steps ahead): event2

Step 4 — evaluate the claims
- C1 (event2 in the next state from state0) is false (state1 has event3).
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state, i.e., event2 two steps ahead) is true because state2 contains event2.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether the implication C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is true given the context.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" So assume at time t1 event1 occurs.

Step 2 — restate the constraints
- Initially (time t0) event3 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any state immediately following an event1 must be event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason by constructing a possible sequence consistent with the constraints
- At t0: event3 (given).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. Take event1 at t1 (this satisfies C1).
- After event1, event2 must happen at t2.
- After event2, event1 must happen at t3.
- Continue alternating event1, event2 indefinitely (t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, t4: event2, ...).

This infinite alternation satisfies all given rules. In this sequence, after t0 there is no requirement that event3 must occur again — it need not ever occur after t0.

Step 4 — conclusion
- We have a model where C1 holds (event1 at t1) but event3 does not happen again. Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is not guaranteed by the constraints.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (i.e. C2 asserts that whenever event1 happens next, event3 will happen.)

Step 2 — Restate the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — Find a concrete trace that satisfies C1 but not event3
- Start: initial state had event3 (given).
- Next state: choose event1. This satisfies C1.
- By the rules: after that event2 must happen, then event1 must happen, then event2, etc. The system can loop forever between event1 and event2.
- Nothing in the rules forces event3 to occur again after that point.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- We have a situation where C1 is true (event1 happens next) but event3 does not happen afterward. Therefore the implication in C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds (i.e., event1 happens in the next state), then event3 happens.""

Step 2 — review the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event3, there are two allowed next events:
  - If next is event1: sequence becomes event3 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... (1 and 2 alternate forever).
  - If next is event2: sequence becomes event3 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... (1 and 2 alternate forever).
- In neither branch is there any rule that allows returning to event3 after the initial occurrence; once you go to event1 (or event2) you alternate between 1 and 2 only.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that if event1 happens next, then event3 happens (again). But given the rules, if event1 happens next, the subsequent events will be 2,1,2,... and event3 does not occur again.
- Therefore the implication ""If C1 then event3 happens"" is false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That's a tautology (a reflexive implication), so C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 given the context
- C2 is the material implication (C1 ⇒ event2). Since C1 holds, C2 will be true exactly when event2 happens.
- The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does indeed happen (at least initially).

Conclusion
- Because C1 holds and event2 happens, C2 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s asked:
You ask whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1:
C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" That is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 holds.

Step 3 — examine C2:
C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to asserting that event2 happens.

Step 4 — use the context:
The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does in fact happen.

Conclusion:
Given C1 is true and event2 happens (from the context), C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 says ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A). So C1 holds (is true) in the given scenario (and in any scenario).

Step 3 — examine the context for event2
- The context explicitly states that initially event2 happened. Thus event2 is true (it has occurred).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is an implication whose antecedent (C1) is true and whose consequent (event2) is also true. Therefore the implication C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what is being asked
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (relative to the current/initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state it is true that event3 happens in that state's next state (so C2 asserts event3 happens two steps from now).

Step 2 — apply the context sequence rules
- Initially (state s0): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → in s1: event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen → in s2: event3.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen → in s3: event1 or event2, etc.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event3 in the next state s1): false, because s1 contains event2, not event3.
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state s1 → i.e., event3 happens in s2): true, because from s1 (event2) the next state s2 must have event3.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (i.e., one step from now.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in one step from now, C1 is true — equivalently, event3 happens two steps from now.

Step 2 — apply the given rules starting from the initial state
- Initially (time 0): event1 happened.
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"" → at time 1: event2.
- By ""after event2, event3 must happen"" → at time 2: event3.
- (After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen at time 3, but we don't need that for this question.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2 at the initial state
- C2 claims that at time 1, C1 is true; C1 at time 1 claims that at time 2 event3 happens.
- From the timeline above, event3 does happen at time 2, so C1 is true at time 1, so C2 is true at time 0.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Let S0 be the initial state where event1 happened.
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get S1: event2.
- From ""after event2, event3 must happen"" we get S2: event3.
- C1 (at S0) asserts ""event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in S1) — this is false (S1 has event2).
- C2 (at S0) asserts ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in S1, event3 happens in S1's next state (S2). That is true (S2 has event3).

Therefore C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (E2 ∧ E1).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (C1 → E2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions (context)
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Since event1 happens initially, event3 must happen after it.
- Once event3 happens, no further events can occur. Therefore there is no time after the initial event1→event3 sequence to perform event2.
- Event2 cannot occur before the initial event1 (the problem states event1 happened initially), so event2 cannot occur at any point in any allowed sequence. Thus C1 (E2 ∧ E1) cannot actually be satisfied under the given constraints.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Logically, C1 → E2 is true whenever C1 entails E2. Here C1 explicitly includes E2 (C1 is E2 ∧ E1), so C1 → E2 is trivially true.
- Also, since C1 is impossible under the context, the implication C1 → E2 is vacuously true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (event2 ∧ event1).
- C2 is ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (C1 → event2).

Step 2 — examine C1:
- C1 explicitly asserts event2. So in any situation where C1 is true, event2 is true by conjunction elimination.

Step 3 — consider the context (optional check):
- The context may actually prevent C1 from ever holding (after event1 comes event3 and then nothing, so event2 cannot occur), but that only means the antecedent C1 is impossible — an implication with an impossible antecedent is still true (vacuously).

Conclusion:
- C2 is logically true (whether because C1 entails event2 directly, or vacuously if C1 cannot occur).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine C1
C1 is the statement ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""

Step 3 — logical consequence
From the conjunction in C1, event2 is directly entailed (conjunction elimination). Therefore whenever C1 holds, event2 holds.

(As a side note: even if C1 were impossible given the scenario, the implication ""if C1 then event2"" would still be true vacuously; but here it is also true by direct entailment.)

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., event1 holds at all times)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., it is not the case that event1 always happens)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s)
- Start: event2 (initial).
- Then must be event3.
- Then must be event1.
- After event1 we go to either event2 or event3, and the rules force continuing cycles: …→1→2→3→1→… or …→1→3→1→3→….
- So event1 does occur repeatedly, but it does not occur at every time point (the initial steps include event2 and event3 before the first event1).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Interpreting ""always happens"" in the natural, standard way (holds at every time point), C1 is false because initially event2 (and later event3) occur without event1.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Hypothesis C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — means event1 holds at every point in the execution.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially. So at that initial point event1 did not hold.
- The rules force the following transitions: after event2 → event3; after event3 → event1; after event1 → either event2 or event3. So a possible trace is: event2 (initial) → event3 → event1 → …
- Although event1 will occur repeatedly later, it does not hold at the initial point (and also not at the times when event2 or event3 occur). Therefore ""event1 always happens"" is false.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False. So we need to check whether C1 (""Event1 always happens"") holds; if C1 holds then C2 is False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially: event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- From the initial event2 we get: 2 → (must) 3 → (must) 1. So event1 occurs (at least once).
- After event1 there are two choices:
  - If 1 → 2, then 2 → 3 → 1, so event1 returns.
  - If 1 → 3, then 3 → 1, so event1 returns.
- In either choice, after any occurrence of event1 we are guaranteed to reach event1 again in a finite number of steps. Thus event1 occurs repeatedly in every possible continuation.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 holds (event1 inevitably occurs and recurs in all continuations). Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens."" (i.e., both events occur at some point)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This logically reduces to: whenever event2 occurs, event3 also occurs (since event2→(event2∧event3) is equivalent to event2→event3).

Step 2 — examine the rules (context)
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 occurs.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So any occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event3.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So any occurrence of event3 is followed by event2.
These rules create a guaranteed sequence: event1 → event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → …, so both event2 and event3 occur (possibly repeatedly).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- Because the rules require that every time event2 happens it is followed by event3, whenever event2 occurs, event3 also occurs. That makes the consequent of C2 true whenever the antecedent holds. Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (equivalently: event2 → (event2 ∧ event3), which reduces to event2 → event3.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 occurs.)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (So event3 occurs after event2.)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (Consistent with event2 already occurring; may repeat.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From initial event1, event2 must happen.
- From event2, event3 must happen.
- Therefore both event2 and event3 do happen, so C1 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires that whenever event2 happens, event3 also happens. The conditions explicitly state that after event2, event3 must happen, so event2 → event3 is guaranteed.
- Thus C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — restate premises
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 → event3)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → event2)

Step 2 — understand the hypothesis
- C1: event2 happens AND event3 happens.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. Symbolically, C2 is event2 → (event2 ∧ event3).
  That simplifies to event2 → event3 (because event2 → event2 is trivial).

Step 3 — derive consequences
- From the premise ""after event2, event3 must happen"" we have event2 → event3 directly.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since event2 → event3 holds from the premises, event2 → (event2 ∧ event3) also holds. Therefore C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- You are asked whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event3 happened.
- From ""after event3, event1 must happen"" we know Event1 will (indeed must) occur after the initial Event3.
- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Since Event3 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" C1 already holds, and Event1 also must happen from the rules.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Because C1 is true (Event3 happened) and Event1 is also forced to happen, C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The context states that initially event3 happened. So the proposition ""event3 happens"" is already true.
2. C1 is ""event3 happens or event2 happens."" Since event3 has already happened, C1 is true (the disjunction is satisfied by event3).
3. C2 is ""event1 happens or C1 holds."" Because C1 holds (from step 2), the disjunction in C2 is true regardless of whether event1 happens.
4. Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 is the claim ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" We must determine whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 has occurred.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (So event1 will happen sometime after the initial event3.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (They force each other to occur repeatedly.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant unless event2 occurs; nothing forces event2 to occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens."" Since event3 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" C1 holds (true), so C2 is true. (Independently, event1 must also happen because event3 occurred, so the first disjunct is also true.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — deduce from the rules:
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 event3 must happen, event3 does indeed happen (at least once).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is true if either C1 is true or event3 happens.
- We already know event3 happens, so the disjunction is true regardless of C1.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is true given the context.
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So event3 will (at least) occur after the initial event2.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (non-deterministic choice).
- After event1, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about C1
- C1 says every time event3 happens, event2 happens. But the rules allow a branch: event3 → event1 (because after event3 either event1 or event2 may happen). In that branch event3 is followed by event1, so event3 does not necessarily imply event2. Thus C1 is not entailed by the context (C1 can be false).

Step 4 — reason about C2 = (C1) OR (event3 happens)
- Independently of C1, the context guarantees event3 happens (initial event2 → event3 must happen). Therefore the disjunction C1 ∨ event3 is true because ""event3 happens"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event3 -> event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" (i.e., (event3 -> event2) OR event3).
Question: Is C2 true or false?

Step 2 — examine the context rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So event3 does indeed occur (at least once).
- The other rules allow branches (event3 can be followed by event1 or event2; event1 forces event3).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is not guaranteed: from event3 the rules allow event1 as an alternative, and event1 leads back to event3, so a sequence event3 -> event1 -> event3 -> ... can occur without any event2 happening. Thus C1 need not hold (C1 is false in general).
- C2 is a disjunction. Because event3 does happen (derived immediately from the initial event2), the second disjunct ""event3 happens"" is true. Therefore C2 is true (a disjunction is true if any disjunct is true), regardless of C1.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds.

Examine conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (so once event3 has happened, no event1 or event2 can occur afterward).
- The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" only matter if event1 or event2 ever occur, but they cannot occur after event3.

Trace the timeline:
- Since event3 happened initially, and after event3 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any time.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

Evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""Event2 happens OR C1 holds."" Because C1 is true, the disjunction is true (and in fact the disjunction is a logical tautology anyway).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the claim ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So once event3 has occurred, events 1 and 2 cannot occur thereafter.)
- The other rules (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1) only matter if events 1 or 2 occur at all.

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequences:
- Because event3 happened initially and after it no other events can happen, neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any time.
- Therefore event2 does not happen. That makes C1 true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of whether event2 happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: determine whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide the truth value of C2 given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. Thus once event3 has happened, neither event1 nor event2 can occur afterwards (and since event3 is initial, there is no earlier time where event1/event2 could have happened).
- Additional rules: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. These create mutual requirements but are irrelevant if neither can occur at all.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given that event3 happened initially and no other events can happen afterward, event2 indeed does not happen. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true. Since C1 is True, C2 is True.

- C1: Event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event2 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — apply the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- The rule “After event2, event1 must happen” requires that the immediate next event after the initial event2 is event1.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Therefore the next state must be event1, so event2 does not happen in the next state.
- C1 is false, hence C2 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event2 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (call that state S0).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — so in the state immediately after S0 (call it S1), event1 must occur.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" applies later (after S1).
- The rule about event3 is irrelevant because event3 did not occur.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- S0: event2 occurred.
- S1 (next state): by the rule, event1 must happen. Therefore event2 does not happen in S1.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — so in the state immediately following the initial state, event1 must occur.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — so event2 will occur after that, i.e. in the second state after the initial one.
- The rule about event3 is irrelevant because event3 did not occur initially.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- State0 (initial): event2.
- State1 (next state): must be event1 (so event2 does not occur in State1).
- State2: event2 happens.

Since event2 does not happen in the next state, C1 is false, therefore C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event3 → event2).
- C2: (C1 → event3).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, event3 must happen — not used here.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 in this context:
- C1 requires that because event3 happens, event2 also happens.
- But event3 already happened initially and after event3 no other events can occur, so event2 cannot occur (there is no opportunity for event2 to happen before or after).
- Therefore C1 is false in the given context.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens.""
- In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth).
- Since C1 is false in every model consistent with the context, the antecedent of C2 is false, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether the statement C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event3 happened. (So in every allowed history/event sequence, event3 occurs at the start.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event3 must follow.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is also terminal.)

Step 3 — Examine C1
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""
- In the actual (and required) history, event3 did happen initially. There is no preceding event2 (since event3 is initial and terminal), so event2 did not happen. Therefore C1 is false in this context.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens.""
- But the context already requires that event3 happens (it happened initially in every allowed history). That means the consequent ""event3 happens"" is true in all models satisfying the context.
- Therefore the conditional ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is true (the consequent holds regardless of whether C1 holds).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate conditions
- Initially, event3 happened (so event3 is true).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" Given the context, event3 did happen but no events can happen after event3, so event2 does not happen. Thus C1 is false in the given situation.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" This is an implication. The consequent (event3 happens) is already true (it happened initially). An implication with a true consequent is true regardless of the antecedent; equivalently, an implication with a false antecedent is also true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e., if event2 occurs then event3 does not occur.)

Examine conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. So C1 is already false in the scenario (event3 does happen).
- Rules allow transitions:
  - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Find a counterexample to C2
- Start: event3 (given).
- Then choose event2 (allowed after event3).
- So event2 happens while event3 has already happened, making the antecedent of C2 true and the consequent (C1: event3 does not happen) false.

Conclusion
- Because there is an allowed sequence where event2 occurs but event3 also occurs, the implication in C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The context explicitly states that initially event3 happened. That makes C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") false immediately.
2. C2 is the conditional ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" i.e. event2 → (event3 does not happen).
3. For C2 to be true in this setting either:
   - event2 is impossible (making the implication vacuously true), or
   - whenever event2 happens, event3 indeed never happens.
4. But from the rules: after the initial event3, either event1 or event2 must happen — so event2 is possible (not impossible).
5. Since C1 is already false (event3 did happen initially), if event2 does occur the consequent C1 would still be false, making the implication false.
6. Therefore C2 is not true under the given context.

Final verdict: False.
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event2 happens then event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — restate the rules
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → event1.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2.

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence
Start with initial event3. From event3 we may choose event2. From event2 we must go to event1. From event1 we may choose event3. So one possible sequence is:
event3 → event2 → event1 → event3
In this sequence event2 happens and event3 also happens (indeed event3 already happened initially).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false (contradicted by the initial event3 and by the sequence above).
- C2 (""if event2 happens then event3 does not happen"") is false because we have a valid sequence where event2 happens and event3 does happen, so the implication fails.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False given the scenario.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a tautological implication: it is true whenever read classically (an implication of the form P → P is always true). Even if event3 never occurs, the implication is still true (false antecedent makes the implication true). So C1 holds.

Step 3 — examine the scenario conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once the initial event1 has occurred, no further events (including event3) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event1 does indeed happen (at the initial moment).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" We established C1 holds. The scenario also guarantees event1 happens (initially). So the conditional in C2 is satisfied.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- We are asked whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" That is a tautology (p → p), so C1 always holds (is true).
- From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is a fact in the scenario (event1 happens).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Since C1 is true, the antecedent of C2 holds.
- The consequent of C2 is ""event1 happens,"" which is true because event1 happened initially.
- An implication with a true antecedent and a true consequent is true.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: (event3 → event3).
- C2: (C1 → event1). We must decide if C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1:
- The formula ""event3 → event3"" is a tautology (any proposition implies itself). So C1 holds (is true) regardless of whether event3 actually occurs.

Step 3 — use the context for event1:
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does indeed happen (it already occurred).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 says: if C1 holds, then event1 happens.
- C1 does hold (tautology), and event1 does happen (initially). So the implication C1 → event1 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True."

True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

2. Understand C1
- C1 states: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" This is a logical tautology: any statement of the form P → P is always true (whenever P is true, P is true).

3. Consequence for C2
- C2 says: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" But since C1 is always true in every possible scenario, the implication in C2 has a consequent that is always true. An implication whose consequent is always true is itself always true (regardless of whether the antecedent, event2, actually happens).

4. Context
- The given constraints about event sequences do not change the fact that C1 is a tautology; therefore they do not affect the truth of C2.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the statement ""if event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (i.e. event3 → event3).
- C2 is the statement ""if event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e. event2 → (event3 → event3)).

Step 2 — examine C1
- The implication event3 → event3 is a logical tautology (always true): any proposition implies itself.

Step 3 — examine C2
- C2 asserts that whenever event2 happens, the tautology C1 holds. But C1 is true in all cases regardless of whether event2 happens or not, so the implication event2 → C1 is also true.

Step 4 — sequences / context do not change this
- The given event-sequence rules (initial event2, after event2 either event1 or event3, after event1 nothing, after event3 then event2) do not affect the logical status of C1 being a tautology, so they do not make C2 false.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (i.e. event3 → event3)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. event2 → (event3 → event3))

Step 2 — examine C1
- The statement event3 → event3 is a tautology (an instance of A → A). It is always true regardless of which events actually occur.

Step 3 — examine C2
- C2 says: if event2 happens, then the tautology C1 holds. But C1 holds unconditionally, so C2 is true whether or not event2 actually happens.
- (Also, the scenario states event2 does happen initially, so the antecedent of C2 is satisfied; the consequent C1 is still true.)

Conclusion
- C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Context rules as transition constraints:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event3, event2 must happen.
- So from any occurrence of event1, the next event must be event2. Therefore whenever event1 occurs, event2 follows immediately (hence happens).
- Also, event2 already happened initially, so event2 occurs regardless.

Therefore the implication ""If event1 eventually happens, then event2 happens"" is true (event2 follows any event1, and also already occurred).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 says: ""If C1 holds (event1 eventually happens), then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So whenever event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 is required.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- If event1 ever happens, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees that event2 will happen afterward. So whenever C1 is true, event2 follows.
- (As a side note, even if event1 never happens the implication is vacuously true; additionally event2 already holds initially.)

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify what’s asked
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds (i.e. event1 eventually happens), then event2 happens (at some point).""
We must decide whether that implication is guaranteed by the given rules.

Step 2 — Restate the rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — Reason about executions
- The rules force a cycle: from event2 you get either event1 or event3; from event3 you must get event2; from event1 you must get event2. So whenever event1 occurs, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces a (subsequent) occurrence of event2.
- Thus in any execution where event1 ever occurs (C1 holds), there is necessarily at least one event2 occurrence after that event1. (Note also that event2 has already happened initially, so event2 occurs regardless of when event1 happens.)

Step 4 — Conclusion
- Therefore the implication ""if event1 eventually happens, then event2 happens"" is guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning:
1. Initially event1 has happened.
2. The statement ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means that once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.
3. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true after event1.
4. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Because no events can happen after event1, event2 still does not happen in the next state.
5. Hence C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (this is a statement about event2 never happening in the relevant state)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In temporal terms, this says: in the immediate successor state, event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred (which is the initial state), there are no outgoing transitions to any further state — no next state where any event (including event2) can happen.
- The other “after event2/after event3” statements just say those events are terminal if they occur; they don’t create a successor either.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event2 does not happen) is true in the initial state: since after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. But there is no next state (no successor) after the initial state because no events can occur after event1. Under the standard semantics for a ""next"" operator, ""X φ"" (φ holds in the next state) is true only if a next state exists and φ holds there; if there is no next state, ""X φ"" is false.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The context states ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means no further events (including event2) can occur after the initial state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true in the initial state.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. that in the immediate successor state, event2 does not happen.
- But there is no successor state (no next state exists) because after event1 no other events can happen. A claim about the next state therefore cannot be satisfied.
- Under the usual interpretation where “holds in the next state” requires an actual successor state, C2 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event3 always happens."" We must decide whether C2 is True (i.e., C1 is false) or False (i.e., C1 is true).

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event3 has happened.
- Transition rules: after event1 → event2 must happen next; after event2 → event3 must happen next; after event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the initial event3 the next event can be event1 or event2.
  - If next = event2, the following must be event3 (…3,2,3,…).
  - If next = event1, then next must be event2, then event3 (…3,1,2,3,…).
- In both cases event3 recurs, but it is not forced to occur at every step: immediately after some occurrences of event3 the next event can be event1 (which is not event3).

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"" at every step) does not hold because there exist valid sequences where an event other than event3 (e.g., event1) occurs after event3.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
First interpret C1 as the claim ""at every step/event, event3 occurs"" (i.e. event3 always holds). We test whether that must be true given the rules.

Rules and a counterexample:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. Choose event1 next.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So next is event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So next is event3.
Thus the sequence 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, ... obeys all rules. But at the second position the event is 1 (not 3), so event3 does not occur at every step.

Therefore C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""It is not true that event3 always happens.""

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event1 → event2 must happen next.
- After event2 → event3 must happen next.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace sequences / check ""always"":
- From the initial event3, a next event could be event2. Then the sequence is event3 → event2 → event3 → ...
  - Notice the step immediately after the initial event3 is event2 (not event3).
- Alternatively, from event3 one could go event1 → event2 → event3, so again there are steps (event1, event2) where event3 is not happening.
- Thus event3 recurs (indeed it must happen infinitely often), but it does not occur at every step/time point.

Conclusion:
- Because there are reachable steps where event3 does not hold, the claim ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Step 1 — what’s asked
- Determine whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" That is a tautological implication (P → P), so C1 is always true.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context states that initially event2 happened, so ""Event2 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since ""Event2 happens"" is true (and C1 is also true), the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether the statement C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true (there is at least one occurrence).
- C1 is the formula ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (event1 → event1).

Step 3 — analyze C1
- event1 → event1 is a tautology (a formula true in all cases). So C1 holds regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is the disjunction ""event2 happens OR C1 holds"".
- Since C1 holds (tautologically), the disjunction is true. (Also, independently, event2 in fact happened initially, so the left disjunct is true as well.)

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
The question asks whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true.
- Rules about what must follow events are irrelevant to whether C2 is true now, except that they also do not contradict the initial fact.
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"", which is a logical tautology (always true).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C1 holds (tautology).
- Event2 also holds (given).
- A disjunction is true if either disjunct is true; here both are true, so C2 is true. (Even if event2 were absent, C1 alone would make C2 true.)

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 occurs in all possible executions from the start.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- There is also a rule ""After event3, event1 must happen,"" but that cannot be triggered because no events can occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — consequences for C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false in this scenario because event2 happens initially and prevents any subsequent events, so event1 cannot occur.
- C2 is the implication ""If event1 eventually happens, then event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 already happens initially in every possible execution. Thus either (a) the antecedent C1 never holds (making the implication vacuously true under standard logic) or (b) even if C1 were to hold, event2 still happened (it happened initially). In both readings, the implication is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 states: ""If C1 holds (i.e. event1 eventually happens), then event2 happens.""
- We must determine whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So every possible execution/trace begins with event2 having occurred.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has happened (which is initially), no further events can occur.
- ""After event3, event1 must happen."" Irrelevant because event3 can never occur after event2.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Irrelevant because event1 cannot occur after event2.

Step 3 — trace the possible executions
- Because event2 occurs initially and no events can occur after it, event1 can never actually occur in any trace. So C1 is false in all traces.
- However, event2 does occur in every trace (it is initial).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- The implication ""if C1 then event2"" is true whenever, in every trace where C1 holds, event2 holds.
- There are no traces where C1 holds (event1 never happens), and event2 holds in all traces anyway (it happened initially). Thus there is no counterexample trace with C1 true and event2 false.
- Therefore the implication is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true in every allowed run.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred (and it has, initially), no further events (including event1) can occur.
- The rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event3 can never occur after the initial event2 (no further events allowed).

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- There are no runs in which C1 holds (event1 cannot happen after the initial event2), so the antecedent of C2 never holds. Moreover, event2 is true in every run anyway (it happened initially).
- Therefore, in every model consistent with the context, ""If C1 then event2"" is true (vacuously or because event2 already holds).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., at some point in the timeline, event1 or event3 occurs).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So at the initial moment, event1 is true.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen. (This creates a cycle between event1 and event3, possibly with event2 in between.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- At time 0 event1 has happened, so C1 is already true at the initial moment.
- Therefore C1 holds immediately, so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied right away.
- Moreover, the rules enforce a repeating cycle (event1 → (event2 →) event3 → event1 ...), so event1 or event3 will recur indefinitely.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happens, so the proposition C1 (""event1 happens or event3 happens"") is already true at the initial moment.
- ""Eventually"" includes the present moment, so C1 holds at time 0, hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied immediately.
- (If one interprets ""eventually"" as some future time strictly after the start, the transition rules still force a cycle: from 1 you go to 2 or 3; from 2 you must go to 3; from 3 you must go to 1. Any allowed run thus contains infinitely many occurrences of event1 and event3, so C1 holds at many future times as well.)

Therefore C2 is True.
---
You ask whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 = ""event1 happens or event3 happens"") is true or false.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially, event1 has happened. So C1 is already true at the initial point (event1 holds).
- Even if ""eventually"" were interpreted to mean ""at some strictly later time"" (excluding the current moment), the rules force that after event1 either event2 or event3 must occur. If event3 occurs next, C1 holds later; if event2 occurs next, then event3 must occur after event2, so C1 (via event3) still holds later. Also after any event3, event1 must occur, so event1 will recur as well.
- Therefore under either interpretation (including the current moment or strictly later), C1 will occur (indeed it already does), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""Event1 happens"" is true.
- Therefore C1 is true (true OR anything is true).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens AND C1 holds.""
- We have Event1 true and C1 true, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C2 is the statement ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""

Step 2 — facts from the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 did not (and cannot) happen.
- The rules about event2 → event3 and event3 → no others are irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true because event1 happened.
- C2 (""event1 and C1"") is true because event1 is true and C1 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens."" We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- The context states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So Event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so Event2 does not happen after Event1.
- The other rules about event2 → event3 and event3 → no other events are irrelevant because Event2 did not occur.

Step 3 — logical simplification
C1 = (Event1 OR Event2). Since Event1 is true, C1 is true regardless of Event2.
C2 = (Event1) AND (C1). With Event1 true and C1 true, C2 is true. (Also note C2 simplifies to just Event1, which is given.)

- Other constraints (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event1 → event2; after event2 → no other events) do not contradict the initial occurrence of event2.

- C2 asserts that at some time in the future (including now) C1 holds. Since C1 holds now, C2 is also true.

Final answer
True

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked:
   - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. eventually (event2 eventually happens)).

2. Use the conditions:
   - Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment there is an occurrence of event2.
   - The other conditions (after event2 no other events can happen, etc.) do not prevent the initial occurrence.

3. Evaluate C1:
   - Since event2 already happened initially, ""event2 eventually happens"" is true at the initial moment (eventually includes the present).

4. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 is ""eventually C1"". But C1 is true now, so there exists a time (the present) at which C1 holds. Therefore C2 is true.
   - (Also formally F F p ≡ F p, so nested ""eventually"" collapses to a single ""eventually"".)

Thus C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (♦event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (♦(♦event2)), i.e. ♦♦event2.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial moment event2 has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the system halts after that).
- The other rules (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event1 → event2) do not invalidate the initial occurrence of event2.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2
- Because event2 has already happened at the initial moment, C1 (♦event2) is already true at the initial state.
- If C1 is true now, then there exists a time (the current time) at which C1 holds, so ♦(C1) is also true. Also, in linear temporal logic ♦♦φ is equivalent to ♦φ, so C2 is equivalent to C1.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, Event1 happened. (So ""Event1 happens"" is true in the history.)
- Other rules (after event3 → event1 must happen; after event1 → event2 must happen; after event2 → no other events) do not negate the initial occurrence of event1.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 = (Event1 happens) or (Event3 happens). Since Event1 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2 = (Event1 happens) or (C1 holds). Again, Event1 happened, so that disjunction is true (and C1 is also true).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event3 happens.""

Step 2 — Simplify the statements
- C2 = Event1 OR (Event1 OR event3) which is equivalent to Event1 OR event3 (so C2 ≡ C1).

Step 3 — Use the context
- The context explicitly states: ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means Event1 happens (it already occurred).

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- Since Event1 happens, C1 (""Event1 or event3"") is true.
- Therefore C2 (equivalent to C1) is also true.

Final answer: True

- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". Since Event1 is true (and C1 is also true), C2 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:

- After event3, no other events can happen (so no further events occur).
- The rules ""after event1, event3 must happen"" and ""after event2, event3 must happen"" are irrelevant here because event1 and event2 cannot occur after event3.

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- Because event3 already happened initially, the statement ""event3 eventually happens"" (C1) is satisfied.
- The conjunct ""event3 happens"" is also satisfied.
- Therefore C2 (C1 and event3 happens) is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked
C2 is the conjunction: (C1) ""Event3 eventually happens"" AND ""event3 happens"". The question: is C2 true or false given the context?

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.  
- After event3 no other events can happen.  
- After event1 or event2, event3 must happen (irrelevant here because event1/2 cannot occur once event3 has happened).

Step 3 — reason about the sequence
Since event3 has already occurred initially, the statement ""event3 happens"" is true. That also makes ""event3 eventually happens"" true (the occurrence already satisfies the eventuality). The other constraints do not contradict this.

Conclusion
True

Identify the claim
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens.""

Examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 has already happened.
- After event3 no other events can occur (so no events can occur later).
- The rules ""after event1/event2, event3 must happen"" are irrelevant because event1 and event2 cannot occur after the initial event3, and they did not occur before it.

Reasoning
- Because event3 happened initially, the statement ""event3 eventually happens"" (C1) is true.
- C2 is simply the conjunction of C1 and ""event3 happens""; both parts are true.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and after it no other events can happen, event3 cannot happen. Thus C1 is true.
- Event1 does happen (given), and C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds (i.e., Event1 happens AND Event3 does not happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 definitely occurs (and occurs first).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore once event1 has occurred, no subsequent events (including event2 or event3) can occur.
- ""After event2, either event1, or event3 must happen."" This only constrains what must follow if event2 occurs.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Irrelevant if event3 never occurs.

Step 3 — Reason about possible event sequences:
- event1 has already happened initially.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, neither event2 nor event3 can occur after event1.
- event2 cannot occur before event1 because event1 is initial (first). So event2 never occurs.
- Consequently event3 does not occur at any time.

Step 4 — Evaluate the hypothesis:
- Event1 happens: True (given).
- Event3 does not happen (C1): True (deduced).
- Therefore C2 (Event1 happens and C1 holds) is True.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds (i.e., Event1 happens AND Event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions

- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → once event1 has happened, the sequence ends; no further events (including event3) can occur.
- Other rules (about event2) are irrelevant because event2 does not occur in the timeline given the first two conditions.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- The sequence begins with event1 and, by the rule, no further events can occur afterward. Therefore event3 cannot occur at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Event1 happens: true.
- Event3 does not happen (C1): true.

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""

Step 2 — inspect the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 does occur at the current/initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing can happen in the next state).
- The other rules (1→3 and 3→1) are irrelevant once event2 has occurred because no events can follow event2.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At the initial state event2 happens.
- By ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the next state has no events, so event2 does not happen in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false in this scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that whenever event2 happens, C1 holds.
- We have an actual occurrence of event2 (initially) but C1 is false for that occurrence, so the implication is false (true antecedent, false consequent).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (i.e. if event2 happens, then event2 happens in the next state.)

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so ""event2 happens"" is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen — so there is no event in the subsequent state (in particular, event2 does not happen in the next state).

Step 3 — evaluate the implication C2:
- The antecedent of C2 (""event2 happens"") is true (it did happen initially).
- The consequent C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false (no events occur after event2).
- An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Therefore C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so the antecedent of C2 is true at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen. That forbids any event from occurring in the next state after an event2.

Step 3 — examine C1
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no events (including event2) can happen in the next state. So C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2 (implication)
- The antecedent ""event2 happens"" is true (it did initially), but the consequent C1 is false. A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.

- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

The first three rules force an alternating sequence 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... starting from the initial event1. This infinite alternation satisfies all rules and never requires event3 to occur. The rule about what must follow event3 is conditional and does not force event3 to ever happen.

Because there is a valid sequence (the alternating 1/2 sequence) in which event3 does not occur, C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 is not guaranteed to always happen).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the initial event1 and the two mutual obligations, one valid (and simple) infinite sequence is 1,2,1,2,1,2,... — this satisfies all constraints and never involves event3.
- Nothing in the given conditions forces event3 to occur at any point.
- Because there is at least one allowed execution where event3 never happens, the claim ""Event3 always happens"" is not guaranteed.

Final answer
True
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 always happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event3 does not always happen).

Examine the given conditions:
1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. After event1, event2 must happen.
3. After event2, event1 must happen. (repeated, same constraint)
4. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Trace possible sequences consistent with these rules:
- From the initial event1, rule (2) forces event2 next.
- From event2, rule (3) forces event1 next.
- Thus the system can (and is allowed to) keep alternating event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 ... forever.
- There is no rule that requires event3 to occur at any point. The only constraint involving event3 is what must follow if event3 happens, not that it must happen.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is not guaranteed by the rules and can be false (for example, the infinite alternating sequence 1,2,1,2,... never includes event3).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens or Event3 happens (i.e., at least one of them occurs).
- C2: C1 eventually holds (i.e., eventually Event1 or Event3 will occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, either Event1 or Event3 must happen (so from the initial Event2, at least one of Event1/Event3 must occur sometime after).
- After Event1, Event3 must happen (so if Event1 occurs, Event3 will later occur).
- After Event3, Event1 must happen (so if Event3 occurs, Event1 will later occur).

Step 3 — trace the required sequence:
- Because Event2 occurred initially and the rule “after Event2, either Event1 or Event3 must happen” applies, it is guaranteed that at some point after the initial Event2 either Event1 or Event3 will occur. That directly establishes C1 at some future time.
- The additional rules (Event1→Event3 and Event3→Event1) only ensure further occurrences (possibly an infinite alternation), but they do not prevent the first occurrence required by the “after Event2” rule.

Conclusion:
- C2 (that eventually Event1 or Event3 occurs) is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""event1 happens or event3 happens"".
- The initial fact is that event2 happened.
- One of the given rules is: after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- Since event2 has already happened, the rule forces that either event1 or event3 will happen (at the next step, or at least eventually).
- Therefore C1 holds (in fact immediately after the initial state), so C2 (""eventually (event1 or event3)"") is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 says: ""Eventually (event1 or event3) holds"" — i.e., after some point, event1 or event3 will occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (This is a mandatory requirement following the occurrence of event2.)
- Additional rules (event1 ↔ event3) only reinforce that once one of them occurs the other will follow, so at least one of them does occur.

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- Since event2 has already happened, the rule ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" ensures that at least one of event1 or event3 will occur subsequently.
- Therefore the disjunction (event1 or event3) will eventually hold.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e. event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is true in every state/path given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions / event model
- Initially event3 occurred.
- From event3 you must go to event2.
- From event2 you go to either event1 or event3.
- From event1 no further events occur.

Step 3 — reason about C1
- The formula event2 → event2 is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in every state regardless of the dynamics of the system.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since C1 is true in every state/path (a tautology), ""C1 always holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" (i.e. event2 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 always holds.""

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1 is a logical tautology: any statement of the form P → P is always true (true when P is true, and true when P is false).
- Even if event2 can never occur in the system, the implication is vacuously true.

Step 3 — relevance of the given event conditions
- The provided constraints on event1/2/3 do not affect the truth of the tautology event2 → event2. Whether or not event2 actually occurs or is reachable, C1 remains true.

Conclusion
- C1 is always true, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the formula ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 → event2).
- C2 states ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in all situations).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Trace possible event sequences (for context):
- Starting from the initial event3, rule forces event2 next.
- From event2, either event1 (then stop) or event3 (which forces event2 again) can follow.
- So possible continuations: event3 → event2 → event1 (halt) or an infinite loop event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ...

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is a logical tautology: p → p is always true whenever p is a proposition about the same state/event occurrence.
- Thus at any point (whether event2 occurs or not), the implication ""if event2 happens then event2 happens"" is true (true when antecedent true because consequent is the same; vacuously true when antecedent false).
- Therefore C1 holds in every reachable situation, so C2 is true.

- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which simplifies to ""Event3 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Event3 eventually holds"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The context states ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 is true at the initial moment.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- Since event3 already happened initially, ""event3 eventually holds"" is satisfied (it holds now).

Therefore: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 simplifies to ""Event3 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. ""Event3 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. (So Event3 is already true at the start.)
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event3 has already happened initially, C1 (""Event3 happens"") is already true now.
- The rules force a cycle: event3 → event1 → event3 → …, so event3 will occur again (indeed infinitely often).
- The ""after event2"" rule doesn't change this since event2 need not occur.

Step 4 — conclude
- Since event3 has already occurred (and will occur again), ""event3 eventually happens"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is ""Event3 happens or event3 happens"", which is just the same as ""Event3 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""event3 eventually holds"" (at some time).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened (so event3 already holds at the initial moment).
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Because event3 happened initially, C1 already holds now (so ""event3"" is true at the initial time).
- The obligations imply a repeating pattern: event3 → event1 → event3 → …, so event3 will occur again in the future as well.
- Even if “eventually” requires a future occurrence, the chain ensures event3 recurs after event1, so that requirement is satisfied.

Conclusion
- C2 (""event3 eventually holds"") is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., in a run starting now, event1 occurs at some future step).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — interpreted as: in all possible executions from the initial situation, event1 eventually happens (equivalently, from every reachable state, event1 is guaranteed to occur at some future point).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3: next is either event1 or event2.
- After event2: next must be event1.
- After event1: next is either event2 or event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial state (event3)
- If after event3 we choose event1, then event1 has occurred (C1 true on that run).
- If after event3 we choose event2, then by the rule after event2 the very next event must be event1, so event1 occurs there too.

Thus from the initial event3, every possible path contains event1 (within at most two steps). Moreover, from any reachable state (event1, event2, or event3) the rules guarantee event1 will occur in the future (from event2 it is immediate; from event3 it is at most two steps; from event1 it will reoccur after at most two steps).

Conclusion
- C1 holds for all executions, and the stronger ""always"" property C2 also holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e. F event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — interpreted as C1 holds at every point in time (i.e. G F event1: from any reachable state, event1 will eventually occur).

Step 2 — transitions from the context
- Initially: event3.
- Transitions:
  - 3 -> {1, 2}
  - 1 -> {2, 3}
  - 2 -> {1}

Step 3 — reason about possible runs
- From 3: either 3 -> 1 (event1 occurs immediately) or 3 -> 2 -> 1 (event1 occurs on the next step). So from the initial state, event1 occurs within at most two steps — C1 is true initially.
- From any state:
  - From 1: next is 2 or 3. If 1 -> 2 then 2 -> 1 next, so event1 returns in one step; if 1 -> 3 then from 3 we get 1 within at most two steps (3 -> 1 or 3 -> 2 -> 1).
  - From 2: 2 -> 1 immediately.
  - From 3: as above, 1 occurs within at most two steps.
- Therefore from every reachable state, event1 will occur eventually (indeed infinitely often).

Conclusion
C2 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypotheses:
  - C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
  - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G F event1: at every point in time, event1 will happen sometime in the future).

- Conditions / transitions:
  - Initially event3 occurred.
  - From event3: next is either event1 or event2.
  - From event1: next is either event2 or event3.
  - From event2: next must be event1.

- Trace / analysis:
  - From the initial event3, if the choice is event1 then event1 has occurred immediately.
  - If from event3 the choice is event2, then from event2 event1 must occur next. So starting from the initial state, event1 is guaranteed within at most two steps.
  - More generally, from any reachable state:
    - If you are in event2, the next event is event1 (so event1 occurs immediately).
    - If you are in event3, the next is either event1 or event2; if it is event2 then event1 follows immediately, so again within at most two steps.
    - If you are in event1, you might move to event2 or event3, but from either of those states event1 is guaranteed within at most two steps (2 -> 1 immediately; 3 -> 1 or 2 -> 1).

Thus from every reachable state there is a guaranteed future occurrence of event1 (indeed within at most two transitions). Therefore G F event1 holds and C2 is True."

- There are rules forcing alternation: after event2 must happen event3, and after event3 must happen event2. Also after event1 must happen event3. Those rules only reinforce that event2 does occur (it already did initially and recurs after event3).

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- C2 = (¬event2) ∨ event2, which is a logical tautology (always true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event1 has happened.
- From event1, either event2 or event3 must occur next.
- Case A: event2 occurs after event1. Then no further events can happen, so event3 never occurs — C1 holds immediately, so ""eventually C1"" holds.
- Case B: event3 occurs after event1. The rules require event2 to occur after event3, and after event2 no further events can happen. Thus once event2 has happened, event3 cannot happen anymore; at that point C1 (no future occurrence of event3) holds, so ""eventually C1"" holds.
- In every possible scenario there is a time after which event3 does not happen, so C2 is true.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., event3 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is (at least) a point in the execution from which C1 is true (equivalently, eventually we reach a run in which event3 does not occur from that point onward).

Examine the conditions and possible traces:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
  - If event2 happens next: after event2 no other events can happen, and event3 never happened in that run. So C1 holds (immediately), hence C2 holds in that run.
  - If event3 happens next: then event2 must happen (by ""after event3, event2 must happen""), and after that no other events can happen. But event3 already occurred, so C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false in that run and will never become true later.

Since there is a possible execution (the branch where event3 occurs) in which C1 never holds, C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e. no occurrence of event3 in the execution).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some point the property C1 becomes true (equivalently, there is an execution in which from some point onward event3 does not occur).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (one of them occurs next).
- If event2 happens, no further events can happen (execution ends).
- If event3 happens, then event2 must happen afterward, and after that no further events can happen.

Trace possible sequences from the initial event1:
1. event1 → event2 and stop. In this run event3 never happens, so C1 holds (indeed it holds immediately).
2. event1 → event3 → event2 and stop. In this run event3 does occur, so C1 is false in that run (it never becomes true).

Because the specification allows both sequences, there exists a valid execution where event3 does occur, making C1 false in that execution. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"" in all executions) is not guaranteed by the context.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (a logical implication about event1)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" i.e., at some time in the run, C1 is true.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial moment event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (as it has initially), the system has no further events.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (irrelevant here because event3 cannot occur after event1)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1)

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- C1 is the implication ""event1 → event1"", which is a tautology (true whenever evaluated). Concretely, at the initial moment event1 is true, so the implication holds there; at any other moment the antecedent is false so the implication also holds. Thus C1 is true now (and in every state).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires that C1 be true at some time. Since C1 is already true immediately (and at all times), C2 is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" (a tautological implication)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" i.e. at some point in the execution C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial point event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So the execution is event1 and then termination.
- The facts about event2 and event3 are irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (event1 already happened and stops execution).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is true at the initial point: antecedent and consequent are both true (and in general the implication is tautologically true whenever considered).
- Therefore C1 holds right away, so ""eventually C1 holds"" is also true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — examine C1 and C2
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A) and is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 is already true immediately (it holds at the initial state), the ""eventually"" is satisfied.

Step 4 — trace sequences / apply conditions
- The initial event1 occurs and, by the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" the trace contains event1 and then nothing. C1 is true at that initial point, so it is true eventually (indeed immediately).

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (a disjunction at a time point).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point either event1 or event2 will happen.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (So event2 will occur following the initial event3.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (Not needed here, but noted.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: event3 (initial).
- By the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"", event2 occurs next.
- Once event2 has happened, no further events occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- At the time event2 occurs, C1 (""event1 or event2"") is satisfied (because event2 occurs).
- Therefore C1 does eventually hold. So C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts that ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" will eventually be true (i.e., at some point in the future C1 holds).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace events:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- The rule ""After event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur after the initial event3.
- Once event2 happens, ""no other events can happen"" — but that doesn't prevent event2 itself from occurring; it only stops further events afterward.
- The rule about event1 (""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"") is irrelevant here because event1 did not occur before the initial state and cannot occur after event2 (no further events).

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Since event2 is guaranteed to occur after the initial event3, C1 (event1 or event2) becomes true when event2 occurs.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually either event1 or event2 occurs).
You must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Since event3 already happened initially and the rule says after event3 event2 must happen, event2 will occur.
- Once event2 occurs, no further events occur. Whether event1 could ever happen is irrelevant because event2 is guaranteed.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis

Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1 = ""Event3 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""If Event1 happens, then C1 holds."" i.e. Event1 → (Event3 ∨ Event1).

Step 2 — examine logically:
- For any proposition P and Q, P → (P ∨ Q) is always true (if P is true then P ∨ Q is true).
- Here, if Event1 happens, Event1 ∨ Event3 is certainly true, so the implication holds.

Step 3 — check context (redundant):
- The context even states Event3 happens initially, so C1 is already true regardless of Event1. That also makes C2 true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is asked:
- C2 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" We must decide if this is true given the context.

Step 2 — Unpack C1 and C2:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens."" (a disjunction: event3 ∨ event1)
- C2: event1 → (event3 ∨ event1)

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- A conditional P → (P ∨ Q) is always true whenever P is true, because P makes the disjunction P ∨ Q true.
- Concretely, if event1 happens, then ""event1"" is true, so ""event3 or event1"" is true. Thus the implication holds.
- (Additionally, from the context event3 happens initially, so C1 is actually already true regardless; but that is not needed — the implication is true in any case.)

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" That is, C2 is the implication: event1 → (event3 ∨ event1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Event3 happens initially (given).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
(One line is repeated but adds no new info.)

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because event3 happens (so ""event3 or event1"" is satisfied).
- C2 asks whether whenever event1 happens, C1 holds. Since C1 is already true (because event3 happened), C1 holds regardless of whether event1 occurs. Also, logically P → (P ∨ Q) is always true, so event1 → (event3 ∨ event1) is valid.

Sample responses:
You ask whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — identify what is asked
- We must decide whether ""C1 implies event2"" is forced by the given rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- event2 → event1 (after event2, event1 must happen).
- event1 → event3 (after event1, event3 must happen).
- event3 → (event1 or event2) (after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen).

Step 3 — trace sequences and test implication
- From the initial event1 we get event3 (by event1 → event3).
- After that event3 we are allowed to choose event1 (because event3 → event1 or event2). If we choose event1, that forces another event3 (event1 → event3), and after that again we may choose event1, etc.
- This yields a valid infinite behavior: event1, event3, event1, event3, ... In this behavior event3 indeed ""always happens"" (it recurs forever), but event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid behavior where C1 holds (event3 always happens) but event2 never happens, C1 does not imply event2. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the question: C2 asserts the implication ""If C1 holds (Event3 always happens), then Event2 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the rules.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, event3 must happen (so 1 → 3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so 3 → 1 or 2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so 2 → 1).

Trace possible sequences starting from the initial event1:
- From the initial event1 we must go to event3 (1 → 3).
- After that 3, we are allowed to choose event1. If we always choose event1 after every event3, the infinite trace is 1,3,1,3,1,3,... In this trace:
  - Event3 indeed always occurs (every second step), so C1 holds.
  - Event2 never occurs.

This is a valid behavior consistent with all rules, and it satisfies C1 while falsifying ""event2 happens."" Therefore C1 does not imply event2.

Final answer:
False
---
You are asking whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the constraints.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 is the implication: if C1 (Event3 always happens) holds, then event2 happens.

Step 2 — the given rules
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — construct a counterexample trace
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1, event3 must happen → do event3.
- After event3, choose event1 (the rules allow either event1 or event2) → do event1.
- After event1, event3 must happen → do event3.
- Repeat: e1 → e3 → e1 → e3 → ...

This infinite trace satisfies all rules, makes event3 always happen (C1 true), and never includes event2. Thus C1 can hold while event2 does not occur.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event3 happens"". Since C1 is ""event3 does not happen"", C2 is logically (not event3) OR event3.

- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (After event1, no other events can happen is irrelevant because event1 never occurs here.)

Step 3 — trace
From the first condition, event3 does happen (and then event2 happens, and the sequence ends). Therefore C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false, but ""event3 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
C2 = (C1) OR (event3) = false OR true = true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens"" i.e. (not Event3) OR (Event3).

Step 2 — examine the given facts:
- Initially, event3 happened. (So Event3 is true.)
- Other rules (after event3, event2 must happen; after event2 no other events can happen; after event1 no other events can happen) do not change whether event3 happened.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Since Event3 is true, C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 = C1 OR Event3 = False OR True = True.
- (Also note logically C2 is a tautology: (not p) OR p is always true.)

Final answer:

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:

- C2: ""Event3 does not happen OR event3 happens."" (i.e., C1 ∨ event3)

Step 3 — use the context:
- The context says ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 does happen.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false, but ""event3 happens"" is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:

First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event3 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: Eventually, C1 holds.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 forces a later event1).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event3 forces a later event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Reasoning through sequences:
- If event3 happens, then by the third rule event2 must happen afterward, and by the second rule that event2 forces a later event1. So any occurrence of event3 forces a later event1. Thus C1 (event3 ⇒ event1) is logically entailed by the rules.
- Because C1 is true from the outset (it holds in every possible execution), it certainly holds at some time (indeed immediately), so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the scenario.

Step 2 — examine C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true in any state regardless of whether event1 actually happens there.

Step 3 — consider C2
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is true in every state (tautology), it is certainly true in the next state(s) reachable from the initial state.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. Hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens.""
2. C1 is a logical tautology (P → P) — it is true in any state regardless of which events occur.
3. From the context: initially event3 happened, so in the next state (immediately after) either event1 or event2 must occur (by the ""after event3"" rule).
4. In the next state:
   - If event1 occurs, C1 (event1 → event1) is true.
   - If event2 occurs, C1 is still true (tautology) even though event1 does not occur.
5. Therefore C1 holds in the next state in all possible branches, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the formula ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 → event1).
- C2 says that C1 holds in the next state (i.e. in the state immediately following the current one).

Step 2 — examine the formulas
- C1 is a propositional tautology: p → p is always true in any state where truth values are standard. So C1 holds in every possible state, independently of which events occur there.

Step 3 — check the model constraints
- The context guarantees a next state from the initial state (initially event3, and after event3 either event1 or event2 must happen), so ""the next state"" exists.
- Since C1 is true in every state, it is true in that next state as well.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: (event3 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2: (event1 happens) AND C1.

Step 2 — use the conditions
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has occurred — the statement ""event1 happens"" is true.
- Whether later events are event2 or event3, that doesn't negate the fact that event1 has happened.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event1 has happened, C1 (event3 or event1) is true (true because of event1).
- Because event1 happens is true and C1 is true, C2 (event1 happens AND C1) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (So C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" because C1 is implied by event1.)

Step 2 — use the context:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen (at least once).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Since event1 happened, C1 (event3 or event1) is true.
- Since event1 happened and C1 is true, C2 is true.

No other context condition contradicts this (e.g., even if event2 then stops further events, that doesn't undo the initial occurrence of event1).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify given facts
- Initially, event1 happened. (So ""event1 happens"" is already true.)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens""
- Since event1 already happened initially, the disjunction (event3 or event1) is true. So C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds""
- Event1 happens (given) and C1 holds (just shown true). Therefore C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypotheses
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e., event3 ∨ event2).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., event2 → (event3 ∨ event2)).

Step 2 — logical examination
- The implication p → (p ∨ q) is a logical tautology: if p is true then ""p or q"" is true. Here p = ""event2 happens"", q = ""event3 happens"". So event2 → (event2 ∨ event3) is always true.

Step 3 — using the event rules (optional check)
- From the initial conditions, event1 occurs, which forces event3 to occur next, so C1 is already satisfied in the given scenario. That only reinforces that C2 holds.

Conclusion
- C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or Event2 happens"" (event3 ∨ event2).
- C2: ""If Event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (Event2 → (Event3 ∨ Event2)).

Step 2 — examine C2 logically:
- The consequent (Event3 ∨ Event2) already contains Event2 as a disjunct.
- So if Event2 happens, the disjunction Event3 ∨ Event2 is true (because Event2 is true).
- Therefore Event2 → (Event3 ∨ Event2) is always true whenever Event2 occurs; and it is vacuously true if Event2 does not occur.

Step 3 — relate to the context (optional):
- The context actually ensures Event3 happens after the initial Event1, so C1 is already true in the given scenario; that only reinforces that C2 holds.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — reasoning:
- C2 is the implication: event2 → (event3 ∨ event2).
- Any time event2 occurs, the disjunction (event3 ∨ event2) is immediately true because the second disjunct (event2) is true. (Logically, P → (P ∨ Q) is a tautology.)
- Even under the temporal rules given, if event2 happens then either event1 or event3 will follow; but that extra detail is unnecessary because the occurrence of event2 already makes C1 true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e. at some moment, event1 ∨ event2 is true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some time in the future, event1 ∨ event2 will occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened → C1 is true right now.
- Transition rules:
  - After event1 → either event2 or event3.
  - After event2 → either event1 or event3.
  - After event3 → event1 (must happen next).

Step 3 — reason about eventual truth of C1
- Because event2 already happened initially, C1 is already true at the initial moment, so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied immediately.
- For completeness, check all possible future cases from any state:
  - If event1 occurs → C1 holds immediately.
  - If event2 occurs → C1 holds immediately.
  - If event3 occurs → the next event must be event1, so within one step C1 holds.
Thus in every possible future path C1 holds now or within at most one step.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time now or in the future, Event2 or Event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine given conditions
- ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the initial moment Event2 has already occurred, making C1 true immediately.
- The other rules (what must follow after event1, event2, event3) do not prevent Event2 having happened initially, and are irrelevant once C1 already holds.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since C1 holds at the initial moment, C1 does eventually hold.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens"".
- C2 = ""eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., at some time now or in the future, event1 or event2 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So C1 is already true at the initial moment.
- Even if ""eventually"" is interpreted to mean strictly in the future, after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen; if event1 happens next, C1 holds then; if event3 happens next, after event3 event1 must happen, so C1 holds within two steps.

Conclusion:
- In all interpretations, C1 holds now or will hold in the future, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event3 happens, then event2 happens. (i.e., event3 → event2)
- C2: C1 holds or event3 happens. (i.e., C1 ∨ event3)

Step 2 — translate the context into facts/rules:
- Initially, event3 happened. (event3 is true)
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → event2)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal; no contradiction)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (not relevant because event1 did not occur)

Step 3 — reason:
- From ""after event3, event2 must happen"" we have C1 true (the implication event3 → event2 holds).
- Also, the context states event3 actually happened (event3 is true).
- Therefore C2 = (C1 ∨ event3) is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event3 happens.""
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. So event3 is true.
- ""After event3, event2 must happen."" This directly states the implication event3 → event2, i.e. C1 holds.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, event3 must happen"" are consistent with the above and don’t negate C1 or event3.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Since event3 happened initially and rule 4 requires event2 after event3, event2 will happen.
- C1 (event3 → event2) is explicitly satisfied by the rules.
- And event3 is true (initially).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is a disjunction: (C1) OR (event3). Both disjuncts are true here, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event3 happens"".
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions in the context:
- ""Initially, event3 happened."" => event3 is true.
- ""After event3, event2 must happen."" => the conditional ""if event3 happens then event2 happens"" holds (this is exactly C1).
- Other rules (about event1 and event2 being terminal) don’t contradict these.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because the context explicitly says ""After event3, event2 must happen.""
- event3 is also true (it happened initially).
- Therefore the disjunction C1 holds OR event3 happens is true (both disjuncts are true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate next state, event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace states:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → in the next state event1 occurs.
- Rule: after event1, event3 must happen → in the state after that, event3 occurs.
- Rule: after event3, event1 must happen → this yields an alternating cycle event1, event3, event1, ...

Thus the immediate next state (right after the initial state where event2 happened) contains event1, not event3. Event3 does occur later, but not in that next state.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that ""event3 does not happen"" holds in the next state. Since the next state has event1 (and not event3), C1 is true in that next state.

Final answer: True
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state has event1.
- By ""after event1, event3 must happen"", there is a subsequent state where event3 occurs.
- Therefore event3 does happen (it cannot be permanently absent), so the proposition C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
- Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So from the initial event1, event3 will happen next.
- (For completeness: after event3, either event1 or event2 happens; after event2, either event1 or event3 happens.)

Step 3 — trace events:
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 event3 must happen, event3 does indeed happen (at least once).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: ""event3 happens OR C1 holds."" We have established event3 happens, so the disjunction is true regardless of whether C1 holds.
- (Note: C1 itself is not guaranteed, since after event2 it might be event1 instead of event3, but that doesn't matter for the truth of C2.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" (a conditional about what must follow event2)
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" So C2 is true if either event3 occurs (at least once in the execution) or the conditional C1 is true for the system.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So from the start, event3 will occur next.
- After event3, the system must do either event1 or event2 (both are possible continuations).
- After event2, the system must do either event1 or event3.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- From the initial event1, event3 is required to happen. Therefore event3 does happen (at least once).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Since event3 happens, the disjunction in C2 (""event3 happens or C1 holds"") is satisfied regardless of whether C1 is true or false.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds.""
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transitions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So event3 indeed occurs immediately after the initial event1.
- Other transitions (after event3 -> event1 or event2; after event2 -> event1 or event3) are irrelevant once we already know event3 occurs.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- C2 is a disjunction: (event3 happens) OR (C1 holds).
- Since the context guarantees that event3 happens (because event1 is initial and is followed by event3), the left disjunct is true.
- A disjunction with a true disjunct is true regardless of whether C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. Since event1 did happen, event3 must (eventually) happen.
- Therefore event3 happens in any model of the context.

Step 3 — conclude:
- Because event3 happens, the disjunction in C2 is satisfied regardless of C1. (As a note, C1 also follows from the rules: event2 → event1 → event3, so C1 holds as well.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — restate rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 2 — propagate from the initial fact
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1, event3 must happen"", event3 happens.
- Because event3 happens and ""after event3, event2 must happen"", event2 happens.
- Because event2 happens and ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 happens (and the cycle continues).

Step 3 — evaluate the hypothesis parts
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" From the rules: event2 → event1 (after event2), and event1 → event3 (after event1). So event2 implies event3. Thus C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" We have shown event3 does happen (and C1 also holds), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

Identify hypothesis:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: Event3 happens or C1 holds.
We must decide whether C2 is true.

Examine conditions and trace events:
1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. After event1, event3 must happen → therefore event3 does happen (next).
3. After event3, event2 must happen → therefore event2 does happen (after event3).
4. After event2, event1 must happen → the cycle continues.

Check C1:
- If event2 happens, then by the rules event1 must happen next, and after that event3 must happen. So event2 ⇒ event1 ⇒ event3, hence C1 is true.

Check C2:
- C2 is ""event3 happens or C1 holds."" From step 2, event3 does happen; and from the previous line, C1 holds as well. Therefore the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means in every possible execution (trace) event1 never happens.

Step 2 — use the given conditions to trace possible executions:
- Initially event2 happened (so the trace starts with event2 having occurred).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event3 must occur next).
- After event3, no other events can happen (trace terminates after event3).
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 ever occurred it would terminate the trace, but nothing allows event1 to occur here).

Step 3 — can event1 occur in any trace?
- It did not occur initially (initial event was event2).
- After event2 the only allowed next event is event3 (it must happen), so event1 cannot occur after event2.
- After event3 nothing can happen, so event1 cannot occur later.
- There is no place in any allowed execution where event1 can happen.

Conclusion:
C1 holds in every possible execution, so C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every allowed execution/trace, Event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so the timeline starts with event2 already having occurred).
- After event2, event3 must happen (event3 is required at some later point).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially, there is no earlier point at which event1 could have happened.
- Could event1 occur after event2? If event1 occurred after event2, then because after event1 no other events can happen, that would prevent event3 from occurring. But event3 is required after event2, so that would violate the requirement. Therefore event1 cannot occur between event2 and event3.
- Could event1 occur after event3? No — after event3 no events can happen.
- Could event1 occur simultaneously with event2? If so, then after event1 no other events can happen, so event3 (which must occur after event2) would be blocked — contradiction.
- Thus there is no allowed trace in which event1 occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") holds in every allowed execution, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible evolution, event1 never happens).

Step 2 — Restate the given conditions
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
- Start: event2 has already occurred.
- Because after event2, event3 must happen, event3 will occur next (eventually).
- Once event3 has occurred, no further events can occur.
- Could event1 happen before event2? No — event2 is given as having happened initially, so there is no prior chance for event1.
- Could event1 happen between event2 and event3? No — if event1 occurred then no further events could happen, which would prevent the required event3, contradicting ""after event2, event3 must happen.""
- Could event1 happen after event3? No — after event3 no other events can happen.

Therefore there is no legal execution in which event1 occurs. C1 holds in the actual and in all possible evolutions.

Final answer:
True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning, step by step:
- Initially event2 happens.
- By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state is one where event1 happens.
- C1 is the proposition ""if event3 happens, then event1 happens."" At the next state event1 is true and event3 is not happening.
- A material implication (if P then Q) is true whenever P is false; here P = ""event3 happens"" is false in the next state, so C1 is true there.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 occurred. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" means in the next state event1 occurs.
- C1 says: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" In the next state event1 does happen (and event3 does not), so the implication C1 is satisfied in that state (either because the consequent is true or because the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true).
- Also, from the rules, event3 can only occur immediately after an event1, so whenever event3 occurs it is preceded by event1 — C1 thus holds generally and in the next state.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened (call that state s0).
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" forces state s1 to be event1.
- The rule ""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen"" means at s2 you either get event2 or event3.
- If event3 happens at some step, by the given rules it can only occur immediately following an event1 (because event3 only appears as an option ""after event1""). Thus whenever event3 occurs, an event1 has just occurred before it.

C1 says ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" Given the rules above, that implication is always true (event1 must precede any event3). Therefore C1 is true in every reachable state, in particular it holds in the next state s1. Hence C2 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Short answer: True.

Because initially event3 happened and the rules state that after event3 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur. Therefore ""Event1 always happens"" is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis:
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is ""Event1 always happens."" So C2 asserts that Event1 does not always happen (i.e., C1 is false).

Step 2 — Examine conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Since initially event3 happened and after event3 no other events can happen, event1 does not occur in this run.
- Therefore Event1 does not always happen (C1 is false).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., Event1 does not always happen)

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So once event3 has occurred, nothing else can occur.)
- Also stated: after event1, no other events can happen; after event2, no other events can happen — but these don't matter once event3 has already happened.

Step 3 — Trace events:
- Because event3 happened initially and after event3 no other events can happen, no subsequent event (including event1) can ever occur in this scenario.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false, because there is at least this initial run (the given one) where event1 does not happen.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens"" (i.e., event1 ∨ event2).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually (event1 ∨ event2)).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at time 0, event2 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → F event2). Irrelevant unless event1 occurs.
- After event2, event3 must happen (event2 → F event3).
- After event3, event2 must happen (event3 → F event2).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0 event2 already holds, so C1 (event1 ∨ event2) is true immediately.
- From the rules, event2 will force event3 later, and event3 will force event2 later, producing an ongoing alternation event2 → event3 → event2 → …, so event2 continues to hold at some times in the future as well.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C1 holds at the initial time (and continues to hold repeatedly), ""eventually C1"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the timeline, Event1 or Event2 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event2 has happened (so at time 0 Event2 is true).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (irrelevant unless Event1 occurs).
- After Event2, Event3 must happen.
- After Event3, Event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence
- Because Event2 holds initially, C1 is true at the initial moment.
- The rules force an ongoing alternation: Event2 → Event3 → Event2 → Event3 … so Event2 will occur repeatedly (infinitely often) after the start.
- Thus C1 holds not only initially but also at many future times.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C1 holds (at the initial time and repeatedly thereafter), ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the future, event1 or event2 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2 must happen event3.
- After event3 must happen event2.
- (After event1 must happen event2, but event1 is not required to ever occur.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event2 has already happened initially, C1 is already true at the initial moment.
- Moreover, the obligations force an infinite alternation event2 → event3 → event2 → …, so event2 continues to occur repeatedly.

Conclusion
- Since C1 holds immediately (and repeatedly thereafter), ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 says: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2 is the negation: ""Event3 does not always happen."" We must decide if C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (this is a conditional obligation that only applies if event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event2 happens initially, event1 must follow, and after event1 no further events are allowed. So the sequence is: event2 → event1, and then termination.
- There is no rule forcing event3 to occur at any point. The rule ""after event3 ..."" only applies if event3 occurs; it does not require event3 to happen.
- Given the mandatory event2 → event1 → end sequence, event3 need not (and in fact cannot) occur in that run.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event3 is not guaranteed to always happen, so C1 is false and C2 (that C1 does not hold) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 is true exactly when Event3 does not always happen (i.e., there is a valid execution where Event3 does not occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (this only applies if event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s):
- Starting state: event2 has happened.
- By rule, after event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no further events can happen. So the execution is: event2 → event1 and then stops.
- In that execution, event3 does not occur. Nothing in the rules forces event3 to occur in every execution.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (Event3 does not always happen), therefore C2 is True.

Final answer: True

We are asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true. C1 says ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every possible execution, event3 occurs).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (this only constrains what follows event3, it does not force event3 to occur).

Trace from the initial condition: event2 occurs, then by rule event1 must happen, and after event1 no further events can occur. That execution contains no event3. Therefore there is at least one valid execution in which event3 does not happen, so ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false. Thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- C1 = ""event3 happens and event2 happens."" C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not(C1)).
- From the context: event3 did happen initially.
- The rules require that after event3, event1 must happen, and after event1 no other events can happen. They do not forbid other events occurring between event3 and the mandatory event1.
- So a valid sequence is: event3 → event2 → event1. This satisfies all rules: event3 happens, event2 happens, after event2 event1 happens, and after event1 nothing else happens.
- Therefore C1 can be true in a sequence consistent with the context. C2 (the negation of C1) is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., not(C1)).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened. So e3 is true at the start.
- After event3, event1 must happen (event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if e2 occurs, e1 must later occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (e1 is terminal).

Step 3 — check if C1 can be true under these constraints:
- A sequence e3 → e2 → e1 satisfies all constraints:
  - e3 initially happened (given).
  - e2 can occur after e3.
  - Both ""after e3, e1 must happen"" and ""after e2, e1 must happen"" are satisfied by the later occurrence of e1.
  - After e1 no events occur, so nothing contradicts that sequence.

Thus C1 is consistent with the context (it can hold).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: event3 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., NOT (event3 and event2)).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened (so event3 does happen).
- After event3, event1 must happen (event1 must occur sometime after event3).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must follow).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs, nothing else can occur afterwards).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Since event3 already happened initially, event1 must occur later, but nothing says event1 must occur immediately; other events may occur between event3 and event1 as long as their own constraints are respected.
- If event2 occurs after event3 but before event1, then after event2 event1 must occur — that is compatible. The sequence event3 -> event2 -> event1 satisfies all given rules.
- Therefore it is possible for both event3 and event2 to occur (C1 can be true).

Conclusion:
- Because C1 can be true, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not true.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 1 — what is C2 asking:
- C2 asserts: event1 → (event3 ∨ event1).

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So event3 is also true.
- (Other context facts are irrelevant to this conditional.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- Given event1 is true and event3 is true, the consequent (event3 ∨ event1) is true. So the conditional holds in the actual scenario.
- More generally, (event1 → (event3 ∨ event1)) is logically valid anyway: if event1 is true then (event1 ∨ anything) is true; if event1 is false the implication is vacuously true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step-by-step:

1. The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true or false.
2. C1 is ""event3 happens or event1 happens"".
3. From the context, event1 happened initially — so ""event1 happens"" is true.
4. If the antecedent of an implication is true, we must check the consequent. Here the consequent C1 is a disjunction that includes ""event1 happens"", which is already true.
5. Therefore C1 is true, so the implication ""if event1 happens then C1"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Second: C1 is ""Event3 happens or event1 happens"" (i.e. event3 ∨ event1). C2 is ""event1 → (event3 ∨ event1)"".

Third: logically, if event1 happens then the disjunction (event3 ∨ event1) is automatically true (because event1 makes the ""or"" true). The given context (after event1, event3 must happen) only strengthens this (event3 will also occur), but that extra detail isn't needed.

Therefore C2 is always true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2 = ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., Event3 happens OR Event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur at all.
- The other two rules (""After event2, event1 must happen"" and ""After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"") are irrelevant if event2 and event3 never occur.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- Because event1 happens initially and no events can occur after it, neither event2 nor event3 can ever occur.
- Therefore ""Event2 does not happen"" is true (C1 is true).
- If C1 is true, then C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is true regardless of whether Event3 happens.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
The hypothesis C2 is the statement: ""Event3 happens or Event2 does not happen."" We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus no event can occur at any time after that initial event.
- Therefore neither event2 nor event3 can occur after the initial event.
- There is no indication any events occurred before the initial event; ""initially"" indicates the start, so event2 and event3 cannot have happened earlier either.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" From the above, event2 cannot happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction is true regardless of event3.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
C2 is the statement ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event2 does not happen"". The question asks whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no later events can occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (Irrelevant if event3 never occurs.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no time after the initial event when event2 or event3 could occur. There is no earlier time (initial means the beginning), so event2 and event3 cannot occur at any time.

Therefore event2 does not happen — C1 is true. If C1 is true, the disjunction ""event3 happens or C1 holds"" is true regardless of whether event3 happens.

Final answer:
True"

Step 1 — what's being asked:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" means no event can occur in the next state, so event1 cannot happen next. Thus C1 is false.
- The conditional ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is a material implication. A material implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" (i.e. C1 → event3)

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules: after event1 → either event2 or event3; after event2 → event1. These matter only if event1 or event2 can occur.)

Step 3 — reason about possible next states
- Because initially event3 happened and after event3 no other events can happen, there is no possible next state in which any event (including event1) occurs. Thus C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is impossible given the context.

Step 4 — truth of the implication
- An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true. Since C1 cannot hold in any model consistent with the context, C1 → event3 is true in all such models.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 is the conditional ""If C1 (event1 happens next) holds, then event3 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the given rules:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- Because initially event3 happened and after event3 no other events can happen, there is no possible model in which event1 happens in the next state. So C1 is impossible under the context.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditional:
- In classical logic, a conditional with an antecedent that is never true (C1 impossible) is vacuously true in all models. (Separately: if one ignored the initial event3 and merely assumed event1 happened, the rules after event1 allow either event2 or event3, so event3 would not be guaranteed; but that hypothetical is inconsistent with the context.)

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not always happen).
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the rules.

Step 2 — restate the rules as transitions:
- Initially: event2 has happened.
- After event1 → event3 must happen (event1 → event3).
- After event3 → event2 must happen (event3 → event2).
- After event2 → either event1 or event3 must happen (event2 → {event1, event3}).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences from the initial event2:
- From the initial event2 the next event is either event1 or event3.
  - If event2 → event3, then event3 has occurred immediately.
  - If event2 → event1, then by the rule event1 → event3, so event3 occurs the step after that.
So within 1 or 2 steps from the start, event3 must occur.

Step 4 — show event3 recurs and cannot be avoided:
- Whenever event3 occurs it is followed by event2 (event3 → event2).
- That event2 again must be followed by either event1 or event3.
  - If event2 → event3, event3 occurs immediately.
  - If event2 → event1, then event1 → event3, so event3 occurs next.
Thus every time the system reaches event2, event3 will occur within at most two steps. Since the system keeps moving according to these rules, event3 will keep occurring repeatedly — there is no way to avoid event3 forever.

Conclusion:
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") holds given the rules.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First identify the hypotheses:
- C1: Event3 always happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event3 does not always happen).

Examine the conditions and trace possibilities:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- From event2, the rule says: either event1 or event3 must happen next.
  - If event3 happens directly, then event3 has occurred.
  - If event1 happens, the rule “after event1, event3 must happen” forces event3 to happen immediately afterward.

Thus, from the initial event2, no matter which allowed choice is taken, event3 will occur (at most one step later). Therefore event3 is inevitable — C1 holds.

Since C1 is true, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens."" (i.e., event3 occurs inevitably in every possible continuation — in particular, it will occur and reoccur given the rules).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 occurred.
- From event2 the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- From event1 the next event must be event3.
- From event3 the next event must be event2.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Starting at event2: if the next event is event3, then event3 has occurred immediately; after that event3→event2, and the choice repeats.
- Starting at event2: if the next event is event1, then event1→event3, so event3 occurs one step later; after that event3→event2, and the choice repeats.
- In every case, after any event2 you either get event3 immediately or get event1 and then event3 immediately after. After each event3 you return to event2 and the same reasoning applies.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event3 is unavoidable and will reoccur (infinitely often) in every valid execution. Therefore C1 holds.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not the case that both event3 and event2 happen).
The question: Is C2 true given the context?

Step 2 — understand the constraints
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So event3 will occur (forced by initial event1).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. That choice could be event1 or event2.
- After event2, event3 must happen (but event3 already must happen from earlier).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- One possible sequence that includes event2: event1 (initial) → event3 → event2 → event3 … (here C1 holds because both event3 and event2 occur).
- One possible sequence that never includes event2: event1 (initial) → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 … (here event2 never occurs; C1 does not hold).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exist valid sequences consistent with the constraints where C1 holds and also valid sequences where C1 does not hold, C1 is possible but not entailed.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not guaranteed/necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened. The rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" therefore makes event3 happen.
- After event3, the rule requires either event1 or event2 to happen. That allows event1 (again) or event2 — event2 is not forced.
- C1 asserts both event3 and event2 happen. While event3 is guaranteed, event2 is optional (it may or may not occur).
- Therefore we cannot conclude ""C1 does not hold"" (C2); C1 might hold in some valid sequence. Hence C2 is not entailed, so the correct answer is False.
---
Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happens.
   - After event1, event3 must happen. So event3 does happen (follows event1).
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. This is a nondeterministic choice: sometimes event1, sometimes event2.
   - After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, it forces event3 afterward).

2. Evaluate C1 (""event3 happens and event2 happens""):
   - event3 is guaranteed (because it follows the initial event1).
   - event2 is not guaranteed: after event3 you may choose event1 repeatedly, yielding the infinite cycle event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 … with event2 never occurring. So C1 is possible (choose event2 after some event3) but not necessary.

3. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does not occur or C1 is false).
   - Because there exist models where C1 holds (choose event2 after an occurrence of event3), C2 is not entailed as universally true.
   - Because there also exist models where C1 does not hold (always choose event1 after event3), C2 is not entailed as universally false either.

The question asks whether C2 is True or False (given the rules). Since C2 is not guaranteed (there is a valid model where C1 holds, making C2 false), C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the meanings:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (X event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F X event3) — i.e., at some future point the immediate next state will have event3.

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- If event1 happens, no further events can happen (system halts).

Consider the two possible immediate successors of the initial state:
- If the next event is event3, then C1 holds immediately and hence C2 holds on that execution.
- If the next event is event1, the system halts and no further events (in particular no event3) can ever occur, so C1 never holds and C2 fails on that execution.

Because there is a possible execution (event2 → event1) where C2 does not hold, C2 is not guaranteed true. Therefore the correct answer is:

False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e. at some state s, the immediate successor s' has event3).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — meaning at some future state along the execution there is a state whose next state has event3 (equivalently, at some point event3 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initial state: event2 holds.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (choice).
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (execution terminates / no further events).

Step 3 — trace possible executions
- One possible execution: 2 → 1, then stop. In this run event3 never occurs, so C1 never holds and therefore C2 never holds.
- Another possible execution: 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → …, in which event3 does occur (so C2 holds on that run).

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists a valid execution (2 → 1 → stop) in which event3 never occurs, C2 is not guaranteed by the conditions. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the immediate next step).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some time in the future there is a state whose next state has event3).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, event2 must happen next.
- After event1, no further events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Sequence A (choosing event3 after the initial event2): event2 → event3 → event2 → ... . In this trace C1 is true at the initial state (next is event3), so C2 holds.
- Sequence B (choosing event1 after the initial event2): event2 → event1 and then stop. In this trace C1 is false at the initial state and there are no further states, so C1 never holds and C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because the system allows a trace (Sequence B) where C1 never becomes true, C2 is not guaranteed to hold in all executions. Therefore the statement ""C2 is True"" is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is logically equivalent to Event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" simplifies to ""Event2 or Event2"", i.e. Event2.
So C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context/rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- From initial event1 we must have event3 next.
- After event3 we may choose event1 (allowed) or event2.
- If we choose event1, the same obligations repeat: event1 → event3 → choose event1 again → ...
- Thus there is a valid infinite trace event1, event3, event1, event3, ... in which event2 never occurs and all rules are satisfied.

Conclusion
- Because a valid sequence exists where event2 does not happen, C2 (which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"") is not guaranteed by the context.

So the question is: given the context, must event2 happen?

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, no further events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Start: event1 → (must) event3.
- After that event3 → either event2 or event1.
  - If we choose event2, then event2 occurs and no further events happen.
  - If we choose event1, we go back to event1 → event3 and face the same choice again.

There is a valid run that always chooses event1 after each event3, producing an infinite loop (event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ...), never producing event2. Since such a run is allowed by the rules, event2 is not guaranteed to occur.

Conclusion:
- C2 (which asserts ""event2 happens"") is not necessarily true.

False

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which simplifies to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"", so C2 also simplifies to ""Event2 happens"".
- From the context: start with event1; after event1 event3 must occur; after event3 either event1 or event2 must occur; and if event2 occurs nothing else can happen.
- There are two possible choices after event3:
  - Choose event2 → then event2 happens (C2 true in that trace).
  - Choose event1 → then by the rule after event1, event3 must happen again, and the same choice repeats. You can loop forever with event1 and event3 and never perform event2.
- Because there is a valid sequence (an infinite loop of event1→event3→event1→…) in which event2 never happens, event2 is not guaranteed by the context. Thus C2 is not necessarily true (though it is satisfiable in some traces).

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:
- The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true.
- C1 is ""Event2 always happens."" That is false: at the initial moment event3 happened (not event2), and there are steps where event3 or event1 occur instead of event2, so event2 does not occur at every time point.
- From the constraints: after every event3 either event1 or event2 occurs; if event1 occurs, then event2 must occur next; after event2, event3 occurs and the pattern repeats. Thus from the initial event3, event2 will occur within at most one step, and it will recur repeatedly thereafter.
- Therefore the disjunction C2 (""C1 or event2 happens"") is true because the second disjunct (""event2 happens"") is true (event2 does occur). Hence C2 is True.
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 is the statement ""C1 holds or event2 happens"", where C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (Repeated but equivalent.)

Trace the possible sequences:
- From the initial event3, if event2 happens next then event2 has occurred.
- If event1 happens next, the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” forces event2 to occur anyway.
Thus in every possible continuation from the initial state, event2 occurs (in fact repeatedly, because event2 → event3 → (event1 or event2) → …).

Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") holds, so C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., in every possible future from the given start, Event2 will occur)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (a disjunction: either C1 is true, or Event2 happens)

Examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (listed twice but redundant)

Trace the possible sequences starting from the initial event3
- From the initial event3, either:
  - Case A: event2 happens next. Then event2 has happened.
  - Case B: event1 happens next. But after event1, event2 must happen — so event2 happens (after event1).
- In both cases event2 inevitably occurs. After any event2 we get event3 and the same branching repeats, so event2 will keep occurring in every continuation.

Conclusion
- C1 is true: in every possible future from the given start, Event2 does occur.
- Therefore the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (relative to the initial state).
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" (i.e., event3 holds now and event3 holds in the next state).

Step 2 — interpret the context as next-state obligations:
- Initially (state S0): event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ⇒ in S1: event1.
- ""After event1, event3 must happen"" ⇒ in S2: event3.
- ""After event3, event1 must happen"" ⇒ in S3: event1.
So the sequence from S0 is S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event3, S3: event1, … (alternating event1 and event3).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 asks whether event3 happens in the next state (S1). In S1 we have event1, not event3, so C1 is false.
- C2 requires event3 now and C1 to hold. Since C1 is false (and event3 does not hold in S0), C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is True or False given the initial facts and rules.
- C1 is the statement ""Event3 happens in the next state."" So C2 is effectively ""Event3 happens and (Event3 happens in the next state).""

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rules (taken as obligations for the immediately following state):
  1. After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., the next state must have event1).
  2. After event1, event3 must happen (next state after event1 must be event3).
  3. After event3, event1 must happen (next state after event3 must be event1).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At the initial state: event2 happened.
- By rule 1, the next state must have event1.
- By rule 2, the state after that must have event3.
- By rule 3, the following state must have event1, and so on — the system alternates event1, event3 after the initial event1.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 asserts ""Event3 happens in the next state"" relative to the initial state. The next state actually has event1, not event3 → C1 is False.
- C2 requires C1 to hold (and event3 to happen). Since C1 is False, C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Start: at the initial state S0, event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → so in the next state S1 we must have event1.
- Rule: after event1, event3 must happen → so in S2 we must have event3.
- Rule: after event3, event1 must happen → so S3 is event1, S4 is event3, and so on (alternating 1 and 3 from S1 onward).

Thus from the initial state:
- C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false because the next state S1 contains event1, not event3.
- C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") therefore is also false (C1 is false, so the conjunction fails).

So C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point there is a state from which Event2 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
There is no rule that forces event2 to ever occur.

Step 3 — trace a valid sequence
- From the initial event3, the rules force: ... → event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ...
- This infinite alternating sequence (3,1,3,1,...) satisfies all constraints and contains no occurrence of event2.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- In this valid sequence C1 is never true (event2 never occurs in the next state), so C2 (""eventually C1"") is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the next step).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point there is a state whose next state has event2).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event3 occurs (call that state s0).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so s1 must be event1).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so s2 must be event3).
- After event2, event3 must happen (this only constrains what follows event2; it does not force event2 to ever occur).

Step 3 — trace the forced sequence
- s0: event3 (given).
- By ""after event3, event1 must happen"" → s1: event1.
- By ""after event1, event3 must happen"" → s2: event3.
- Repeat: s3: event1, s4: event3, … so the system is forced into an infinite alternation 3,1,3,1,...

Step 4 — can event2 ever occur?
- No rule allows or forces event2 to replace the required next-event after a 3 or a 1.
- Since every state after s0 is determined (alternating 1 and 3), event2 never appears in any next state.
- Therefore C1 is never true at any point, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Interpreted as: at some time t, the next state t+1 contains event2.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreted as: there exists some time t such that at t+1 event2 occurs (i.e., event2 occurs at the successor of some state sometime in the future).

(Assume ""After X, Y must happen"" means Y must hold in the immediate next state.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially (state 0): event3 holds.
- Rule A: If event3 holds at a state, then event1 holds in the next state.
- Rule B: If event1 holds at a state, then event3 holds in the next state.
- Rule C: If event2 holds at a state, then event3 holds in the next state.

Step 3 — trace the forced sequence
- From initial event3 at state 0, by A: state 1 must be event1.
- From state 1 event1, by B: state 2 must be event3.
- From state 2 event3, by A: state 3 must be event1.
- And so on: the system is forced to alternate ... , event3, event1, event3, event1, ...

Step 4 — can event2 ever occur?
- The alternating sequence contains only event1 and event3 in every state. There is no state in which event2 occurs, so there is no time t with event2 at t+1.
- Rule C is irrelevant because it constrains what happens after event2, but event2 never appears to trigger it.

Conclusion
- C1 never becomes true at any time, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide if C1 is necessarily true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions

- Other rules (after event2 → either event1 or event3; after event3 → either event1 or event2) are irrelevant because no events follow event1.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event1 happened initially and no events can occur afterward, event2 does not occur at any time in this execution.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 claims event2 must happen whenever event1 happens. Here event1 did happen but event2 did not, so C1 is false in this scenario.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (So C1 asserts: whenever event1 occurs, event2 also occurs.)
- C2: C1 always holds. We must decide whether C1 is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The initial condition gives a concrete sequence start: event1 occurs first.
- The rule “After event1, no other events can happen” means the sequence stops after that initial event1 — no event2 can occur afterward in that run.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 claims event1 implies event2. The observed run (initial event1 and then nothing) is a counterexample: event1 occurs but event2 does not.
- Therefore C1 is not guaranteed.
- Since C1 does not always hold, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., C1 is true in this system).

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Other rules (after event2 → event1 or event3; after event3 → event1 or event2) are irrelevant unless event2 or event3 occurs, but they cannot occur after the initial event1 because event1 prevents any subsequent events.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences:
- The only possible sequence consistent with the rules is: event1 occurs and then nothing else.
- In that sequence, event1 occurs but event2 does not occur.

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2:

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Because Event3 has already happened initially and after Event3 no other events can happen, no further events (including Event1 or Event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore Event2 does not eventually happen (C1 is false).
- Event1 does not happen either.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., event1 happens OR event2 eventually happens).
The question: is C2 true or false given the context?

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- Also: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen.
Key point: event3 has already happened initially, and once it has happened nothing else can happen afterwards.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Since event3 happened initially, there is no time after that when other events can occur.
- That rules out event1 and event2 occurring after event3.
- Could event1 or event2 have occurred before event3? The statement says event3 happened initially (at the start), so there is no prior time in which event1 or event2 could have happened. Therefore neither event1 nor event2 occurs at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens""): false.
- Event1 happens: false.
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1""): false OR false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what hypothesis asks
- C2 is the claim ""Event1 happens OR Event2 eventually happens."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So once event3 has occurred, no events occur later.)
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event3 already happened initially, the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" blocks any further events from occurring at any later time.
- That prevents both event1 and event2 from occurring after the initial moment.
- There is no information that event1 or event2 occurred before the initial event3; the statement ""initially, event3 happened"" means the system starts with event3 already occurred, so no prior events are given.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is false, since no events can happen after the initial event3.
- Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens OR Event2 eventually happens"") is also false (neither disjunct holds).

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis: C2 asserts that C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") holds always — i.e., event3 never occurs at any time.

Examine the given conditions: they state that initially event3 happened. That single fact already contradicts C1, because C1 asserts that event3 does not happen (even at the initial moment).

Therefore C1 is false at the outset, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in all cases, Event3 never happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 has already occurred.)
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- The initial occurrence of event3 already contradicts C1 (which asserts event3 does not happen).
- Regardless of choices later: after the initial event3 → event1 → either event2 or event3.
  - If event1 → event3, event3 occurs again.
  - If event1 → event2, then after event2 → event3 must happen. So event3 occurs again.
- Thus event3 occurs at least initially and in all continuations; C1 cannot hold, and certainly cannot hold always.

- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., Event3 never happens at any time).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 already occurred.)
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about feasibility of C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is contradicted immediately by the initial condition that event3 happened. So C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") cannot be true.
- (Additionally, the transition rules ensure event3 will recur: initial event3 → event1 → either event3 or event2 → if event2 then event3 follows. So event3 occurs repeatedly.)

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" (where C1 is ""Event2 always happens"").

Step 2 — understand the rules:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — examine possibilities / trace sequences:
- One possible trace: 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → ... (here event2 does occur repeatedly).
- Another possible trace: 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (here event2 never occurs).

Because after each event1 there is a choice between event2 and event3, the system can repeatedly choose event3 and never produce event2. Thus C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not guaranteed. Although event1 does happen (initially), C1 can be false, so their conjunction C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (so C2 is true exactly if Event1 happens and Event2 always happens)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Start: event1 (given).
- After that event1 we may choose event3 (allowed by ""either event2 or event3"").
- After that event3 we must have event1.
- After that event1 again we may choose event3, and so on.

So the infinite repetition 1,3,1,3,... satisfies all constraints and never includes event2. Thus Event2 does not have to (always) happen.

Step 4 — conclude about the hypotheses
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not entailed by the constraints (false).
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false (although Event1 does happen, C1 does not).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true or false, given the context rules.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (we can choose one).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — examine C1 (""Event2 always happens"")
- From an event1, we may choose event3 (because after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen).
- If we choose event3, the rules force event1 next, and again after that we may choose event3, etc.
- Thus there is a valid infinite sequence: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ... in which event2 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 asserts ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen initially, but C1 is false, so the conjunction C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C2 is (C1 and event3). C1 is (event1 or event3). So C2 simplifies to event3 (because (event1 ∨ event3) ∧ event3 ⇔ event3).
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur at some later time.
- Therefore event3 does indeed happen, so C2 is true. (Note: event1 cannot occur without violating the mandatory occurrence of event3 after the initial event2.)
---
Step 1 — Understand the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" (So C2 is equivalent to ""event3 happens"", since event3 implies C1.)

Step 2 — Use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. Therefore event3 must occur at some later time.
- After event3, event2 must happen, so the events must alternate (event2 → event3 → event2 → ...).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Because event2 already occurred initially and forces a later event3, event1 cannot occur at any time without preventing the required event3; thus event1 cannot occur in any valid execution.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- Since event3 must occur, C1 (""event1 or event3"") is true (because event3 is true).
- C2 is (C1 AND event3), which reduces to event3. Event3 does occur, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" therefore forces event3 to happen.
- Given event3 happens, C1 (""event1 or event3"") is satisfied (via event3).
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens""; since event3 happens, both parts hold, so C2 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event3 does not happen in the next state).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so next state is either event2 or event3).
- After event2, event1 must happen (but that applies only if event2 occurs).
- After event3, no other events can happen (but that does not forbid event3 from occurring next).

Step 3 — reason about possibilities:
- From the rules, event3 might happen next, but it is not forced (event2 is also a permitted alternative).
- Therefore C1 is possible but not guaranteed.
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event3 definitely does not happen next). That is not supported by the information (we cannot rule out event3).

Conclusion:
- C2 is not entailed (not necessarily true), so the correct answer is: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1 asserts that event3 happens in the next state.
- From the context: after the initial event1, the next state must be either event2 or event3. Both are allowed; event3 is possible but not forced.
- C2 asserts the negation of C1 (""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., event3 does not happen next).
- Since the context does not determine which of event2 or event3 occurs, C1 is not ruled out. Therefore C2 (the claim that C1 does not hold) is not guaranteed and so is false.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 occurred. The rules say the next state must be either event2 or event3 (non-deterministically).
- C1 asserts event3 happens next; that is possible but not guaranteed.
- C2 asserts C1 does not hold (i.e., event3 does not happen next). That also is not guaranteed.
- Because the context does not force event3 to be false, we cannot accept C2 as true. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 OR event2).
- C2 = (C1 OR event1) = (event1 OR event2 OR event1) = (event1 OR event2).
- So C2 is equivalent to C1; both assert that event1 or event2 occurs.

Step 3 — examine the context and possible event sequences:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. Since event3 happened initially, no event1 or event2 can occur at any time.
- The other rules (""after event1, event3 must happen"" and ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"") are irrelevant because event1 and event2 never occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- event1 is false and event2 is false, so C1 is false and thus C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what C2 says
- C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event2 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens).
- Logically C2 = (event1 OR event2) OR event1 = event1 OR event2. So C2 is equivalent to C1.

Step 2 — what the background implies
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. Since event3 is initial and terminal, neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any time thereafter.
- The other rules (""after event1 → event3"" and ""after event2 → event1 or event3"") only apply if event1 or event2 happen; they do not force event1 or event2 to happen now.

Step 3 — evaluate C1/C2
- Because neither event1 nor event2 happens, C1 is false. Since C2 is equivalent to C1, C2 is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning:
- Let E1, E2, E3 denote ""event1 happens"", ""event2 happens"", ""event3 happens"".
- Context says initially E3 happened, and after E3 no other events can happen. So E3 is true and E1 and E2 cannot happen (neither before nor after — E3 is the initial event).
- C1 is ""E1 or E2"". Given the context, C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 or E1"", which simplifies to ""E1 or E2"" (same as C1). Since E1 and E2 do not happen, C2 is also false.

False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is true in the given scenario (so whether C2 is true).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does occur in the scenario.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 occurs, the sequence stops; no event3 can occur after event2.
- The other rules (event1 -> event2, event3 -> (event1 or event2)) don't force event3 to occur before event2, and they don't create any way for event3 to occur after the initial event2 because event2 is terminal.

Step 3 — Reasoning about C1
- C1 requires that whenever event2 happens, event3 happens. In our scenario event2 does happen (initially), but no events can occur after it, so event3 does not occur.
- Since event2 occurs but event3 does not, the implication ""if event2 then event3"" is false in this scenario.

Conclusion
- C1 does not hold in the given scenario, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event2 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every allowed execution, whenever event2 happens, event3 also happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So the initial state already includes event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event2 is terminal: no events can occur after it.
- The other rules (after event1 → event2, after event3 → event1 or event2) do not force any events to have happened before the initial event2.

Step 3 — produce a counterexample / trace
- The allowed execution consisting of just [event2] is consistent with the rules: event2 happens initially, and then nothing else happens (allowed because after event2 no further events can occur).
- In this execution, event2 happens but event3 does not happen. That violates C1.

Conclusion
- C1 is not true in all allowed executions, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event2 happens, then event3 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., C1 is true in the given situation).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened, no further events (including event3) can occur.
- Other rules (after event1 → event2, after event3 → event1 or event2) are irrelevant once event2 has already happened and nothing can follow.

Step 3 — Reason about C1
- C1 (event2 → event3) is an implication. An implication is false exactly when its antecedent is true and its consequent is false.
- Here the antecedent is true (event2 did happen initially). The consequent (event3 happens) is false, because no events can occur after event2, so event3 cannot happen.
- Therefore C1 is false in this scenario.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2
- C2 claims C1 always holds. But we have a concrete case (the given scenario) where C1 is false.
- Hence C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds (i.e., Event2 happens OR Event3 eventually happens).

Step 2 — relevant conditions from the context:
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen (eventually).
- (Other rules about what happens after Event2 or Event3 are irrelevant for this question.)

Step 3 — trace from the initial condition:
- Because Event1 has happened initially, the rule ""after Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen"" forces that at some later point either Event2 occurs or Event3 occurs.
- If Event2 occurs, then ""Event2 happens"" is true, so C2 is true.
- If Event3 occurs, then C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is true, so C2 is true.

There is no allowed trace starting from the given initial Event1 where neither Event2 nor Event3 ever happens. Therefore C2 must hold.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the claim ""Event2 happens OR Event3 eventually happens"" (i.e., Event2 ∨ C1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so the very next event after the initial event1 is either event2 or event3).
- Other rules (after event2 → event1 or event3; after event3 → event1) are consistent but not needed for the immediate conclusion.

Step 3 — trace the possible immediate sequences
- From the initial event1, the next event must be event2 or event3.
  - If the next event is event2, then ""Event2 happens"" is true, so C2 holds.
  - If the next event is event3, then ""Event3 eventually happens"" (indeed it happens immediately), so C1 holds and thus C2 holds.

Conclusion
- In every allowed case starting from the given initial condition, C2 is satisfied. Therefore:

True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" (i.e., event2 occurs at some point, or event3 eventually occurs).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, the next event must be event2 or event3.
- After event2, the next event must be event1 or event3.
- After event3, the next event must be event1.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event1, the next event must be either 2 or 3.
  - If the next event is 3, then C1 holds (event3 did occur), so C2 holds.
  - If the next event is 2, then event2 has occurred, so C2 holds (regardless of whether 3 ever occurs later).
- There is no allowed sequence starting from the initial event1 that avoids both event2 and event3, because after event1 one of them must happen.

Step 4 — conclusion
C2 is necessarily true given the constraints.

- Because after an occurrence of event2 the next event cannot be event2 (it must be 1 or 3), it is impossible for event2 to occur at every time step. Thus C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C2 requires C1 to hold. Since C1 is false (even though event2 does occur initially), C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (interpreted as: at every step in the future, event2 occurs)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true only if event2 occurs and event2 always occurs thereafter (i.e., C1 is true).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice allowed).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (choice allowed).

Step 3 — construct a counterexample sequence
Starting from the initial event2, choose transitions that avoid event2 after the start:
- event2 (initial) -> event1 (allowed after event2)
- event1 -> event3 (allowed after event1)
- event3 -> event1 (forced after event3)
- event1 -> event3 -> event1 -> ... (repeat)

This infinite sequence is consistent with all given rules but contains no further event2 after the initial one. So event2 does not always happen.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 is false (there exists a valid future where event2 does not always occur).
- Therefore C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — What the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This reads as a universal/ global claim that event2 holds at all times (i.e., it is not avoidable).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires both that event2 occurs (true initially) and that event2 always happens (C1).

Step 2 — Conditions (rules)
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event3 → event1 must happen.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2 → either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Construct a counterexample sequence
Start with the required initial event2, then choose transitions that avoid further event2:
- 2 (initial) → choose 3 (allowed after 2) → after 3 must be 1 → after 1 choose 3 → after 3 → 1 → …
Sequence: 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, …
This sequence obeys all rules but contains no event2 after the initial one. Thus event2 is not guaranteed to always occur at every step or infinitely often.

Step 4 — Conclusion
C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false (counterexample above). Therefore C2 (which requires C1) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 holds AND (event2 happens).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and trace consequences:
- Initially, event3 has happened.
- Rule: after event3, event2 must happen. Since event3 has happened, event2 must happen.
- Rule: after event2, event3 must happen. That only reinforces that event3 happens again, but it does not prevent event2 from happening.
- The rule about event1 (after event1, event3 must happen) is irrelevant because event1 need not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Because event3 has happened (initially), C1 (event2 or event3) is true (in fact both happen: event3 already happened and event2 must happen).
- Because event2 must happen (deduced above), the second conjunct of C2 is true.
- Therefore C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: (event2 happens) OR (event3 happens).
- C2: C1 AND (event2 happens). So C2 is logically equivalent to (event2 happens) — because (event2 ∨ event3) ∧ event2 simplifies to event2.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- Rule: after event3, event2 must happen. Thus the initial event3 forces that an event2 occurs afterward.
- Other rules (after event2, event3 must happen; after event1, event3 must happen) only add further events but do not prevent event2.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Start: event3 (given).
- By the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"", an event2 occurs.
- Therefore event2 happens.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since event2 happens, C2 (which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"") is True.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: C1 holds AND (event2 happens).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (So event2 will occur following the initial event3.)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (This creates a repeating obligation but does not prevent event2 from occurring.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 is not asserted to occur.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event3 happened initially, the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to happen.
- Therefore at least event3 (initial) and event2 (forced) happen.
- C1 (event2 or event3) is satisfied (both actually hold).
- C2 requires C1 and event2; since event2 does happen and C1 holds, C2 is satisfied.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2 occurred.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → so the next event is event1 (so event1 does occur at least sometimes).
- But after event1, the rule allows either event2 or event3. If the choice is event3, then at that next moment event1 does not hold (we have event3).
- Therefore it is not guaranteed that event1 holds at every point in time — C1 (""Event1 always happens"") can be false in some futures.
- Since C1 is not guaranteed, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: True
---
Goal: determine whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does not happen in the next state).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means once event2 has occurred, no events occur subsequently (so the next state cannot contain any events).
- The other rules (after event3→event1 and after event1→event3) are irrelevant because no events can follow event2.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after it, event2 cannot occur in the next state.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., Event2 does not happen in the next state.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 has occurred in the current/initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This forbids any events in subsequent states.)
- The rules about event1 and event3 requiring each other only come into play if those events occur; they don't override the ""no events after event2"" rule.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially and ""after event2 no other events can happen,"" no event (including event2 again) can occur in the next state.

Conclusion:
- C1 is false, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False, where C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""

Given rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step-by-step:
1. Initially event2 occurred.
2. From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we get event1 will occur next.
3. From ""after event1, event3 must happen"" we get event3 will occur after that.
4. Therefore event3 does happen. So C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
5. C2 says C1 always holds; since C1 is false (event3 does occur), C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., event3 never happens at any time).
So C2 claims that event3 never occurs.

Step 2 — given conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace:
- From the initial event2, event1 must occur afterwards.
- From that event1, event3 must occur afterwards.
- Therefore event3 does occur (indeed the rules produce the cycle 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → ...).

Conclusion:
- C1 is false (event3 does happen), so C2 (that C1 always holds) is false.

Final answer:
False

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Trace the sequence:
- Since event2 has happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur.
- Once event1 occurs, ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""

Step 2 — apply the context: initially event1 happens (in the current state). After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. After event2 no other events can happen, so the next state contains event2 and not event1.

Step 3 — evaluate C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" asks whether event1 holds in the next state. It does not.

Conclusion: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 asserts: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is ""event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is just equivalent to ""event1 happens"". So C2 says: ""event1 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 holds in the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing else occurs after that).
- The rule about event3 is irrelevant because event3 never occurs.

Step 3 — trace
From the initial state (event1), the next state must have event2. The next state therefore has event2, not event1. No further states can have events.

Step 4 — conclusion
C1 (i.e. ""event1"") does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is equivalent to simply ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. ""Event1 holds in the next state"".

Step 2 — apply the context rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces the next state after the initial one to have event2.
- Therefore in that next state event1 does not happen (it is event2 that must happen).
- The other rules (after event2 no events, after event3 event2) do not allow event1 to occur in the immediate next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the statement: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" So C2 is the conjunction: (event1 happens) AND (event1 → event2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. So a next step of event3 directly after event1 is allowed.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event3 follows.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One allowed sequence is: event1 then event3 (event1 → event3). That satisfies ""after event1 either event2 or event3 must happen"" by choosing event3, and it respects the terminal nature of event3.
- In that sequence event2 does not occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event1 → event2"") is false because there is an allowed sequence (event1 then event3) where event1 happens but event2 does not.
- C2 requires both ""event1 happens"" (true) and C1 (false). A conjunction with a false conjunct is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- From the context, event1 did happen (given).
- But the rule ""After event1, either event2, or event3 must happen"" does not force event2; event3 may occur instead.
- If event3 occurs after event1, then no further events (including event2) can happen.
- Therefore the implication C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is not guaranteed by the premises.
- C2 requires both event1 and C1; although event1 holds, C1 does not, so C2 is false.
---
You ask whether C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") follows from the context.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 requires two things: (a) event1 happens, and (b) C1 holds (whenever event1 happens, event2 happens).

Step 2 — the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So (a) is true in the context.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence consistent with the conditions:
- Start: event1 (given).
- After event1, choose event3 (this satisfies ""either event2 or event3 must happen"").
- After event3 no events can happen (consistent with ""after event3 no other events"").

In this trace, event1 occurred but event2 did not. That makes C1 (""if event1 then event2"") false here (because event1 is true and event2 is false). Since C2 asserts both event1 and C1, C2 is false in this possible, allowed trace.

Conclusion:
- C2 is not guaranteed by the context; there is a valid scenario that falsifies C1 and thus C2.

- After event3, event2 must happen (so the state after that has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).

Trace the sequence from the initial state:
- Initial state: event1 occurred.
- Next state (by ""after event1, event3 must happen""): event3 occurs.
- Following that: event2 occurs, then nothing else.

Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is false — the next state contains event3, not event1.
- Event3 does happen in the next state, so the disjunction in C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Brief justification (concise):
- C2 is ""event3 happens OR event1 happens in the next state (C1)"".
- The context states event1 happened initially and that after event1, event3 must happen. So event3 does occur (in the next state).
- Therefore the disjunction in C2 is satisfied (even though C1 itself is false)."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
C2 states: ""If C1 holds (i.e. event1 eventually happens), then event3 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So C1 is true in the given scenario.)
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- (Also after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen — not needed here but consistent.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event1 occurs (initially), the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces event2.
- Given event2, ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3.
- Therefore any occurrence of event1 leads (via event2) to event3.

Conclusion:
The implication in C2 is guaranteed by the rules, so C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
C2 asserts the implication ""If C1 (event1 eventually happens) holds, then event3 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is guaranteed by the given conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So C1 is true (event1 does happen).
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 -> event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (event2 -> event3)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (event3 -> (event1 or event2))
(The repeated “after event2, event3 must happen” doesn’t change anything.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence from the facts:
Since event1 has happened, by the rule event1 -> event2, event2 must happen afterwards. From event2, by event2 -> event3, event3 must happen afterwards. Therefore, once event1 occurs (and it does initially), event3 will occur.

Conclusion:
The implication in C2 holds, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event3 happens (i.e., C1 → event3).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened (so C1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., whenever event1 occurs, a later event2 occurs).
- After event2, event3 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, a later event3 occurs).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (not needed for this implication).
(One rule is duplicated but that doesn't change the reasoning.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event1 occurs (initially), the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” forces a later event2.
- That event2 in turn forces a later event3 by “after event2, event3 must happen.”
- Therefore, whenever event1 occurs, a (later) event3 will occur.

Conclusion:
- The implication C1 → event3 holds given the rules, so C2 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., from a given point onward, at every step event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there is some future point after which event3 holds always).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, the system stays with no further events.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 does not occur in the given trace.)
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
- The initial event1 has already occurred.
- Because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" there can be no occurrence of event3 at any later time.
- Therefore event3 never occurs in this run.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false (event3 does not happen at all).
- C2 asks whether C1 will become true at some future point. Since event3 can never occur (no future events after event1), C1 cannot become true later.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point it becomes true that event3 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once the initial event1 has occurred, the system reaches a terminal state with no further events.
- The rule ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened and blocks any further events).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- The only actual sequence given the constraints is: event1 (initial), then nothing else.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false in this sequence because event3 does not occur now or at any future time.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") would require that at some later point C1 becomes true (i.e., from that point onward event3 always happens). There is no later point (no further events) at which C1 could become true. Therefore C2 is false.

Answer: False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point it becomes true that Event3 always happens).

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 would also be terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 can occur).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no further events (including event2 or event3) can occur in any future.
- Therefore event3 never occurs in any future.

Step 4 — conclude about the hypotheses:

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., in every allowed sequence, event2 occurs).
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" — so C2 requires event3 occurs and that event2 occurs in every sequence.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened (so event3 does occur at least once).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the initial event3, one valid continuation is: 3 → 2 (then stop). That run contains event2.
- But another valid continuation is: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → ... (always choose event1 after each 3). This infinite run never contains event2, and it respects all rules (after each 1 comes 3, after each 3 we chose 1).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid sequence where event2 never occurs, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- Event3 does happen (true), but C2 requires both event3 and C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 always happens.""
So C2 is true only if (a) event3 happens and (b) event2 always happens.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event3 happened. So (a) is already satisfied (event3 does happen).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (choice).
- After event1, event3 must happen (forced).
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial 3, one option is 3 → 2, which ends and includes event2.
- The other option is 3 → 1 → 3. After that 3 again we again must choose 1 or 2, so we can repeat 1 → 3 indefinitely: 3,1,3,1,3,... (never reaching event2), or eventually choose 2 and terminate.

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2
- Because there exists a valid sequence (3,1,3,1,3,...) in which event2 never occurs, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is also false (even though event3 does happen).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e., in every valid event sequence, Event2 occurs.)

Step 2 — understand the constraints
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine whether C1 must hold
- From the initial event3, we may choose event2 next (sequence 3,2) which ends — here event2 occurs.
- But we can also choose event1 after the initial 3. That forces another 3, and after that 3 we can again choose 1, producing 3,1,3,1,3,... indefinitely. This infinite sequence never includes event2 and satisfies all constraints.
- Because there exists a valid sequence in which event2 never occurs, event2 is not guaranteed to occur in all sequences. Thus C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires both that event3 happens (true, it happened initially) and that C1 holds (false).
- A conjunction with a false conjunct is false.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after some state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point there is a state after which Event3 occurs — equivalently, Event3 occurs at some time).

Step 2 — restate the constraints
- Initially Event1 has happened.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen.
- After Event2, no other events can happen (Event2 is terminal).
- After Event3, Event1 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the initial Event1, Event2 must occur next (or at least must occur before termination). Once Event2 occurs, no further events can happen. Thus one valid run is: Event1 → Event2 → stop.
- In that run no Event3 ever occurs, so C1 is false in the initial step and C2 (that someday C1 holds) is false for that run.
- Because there is a valid behavior with no Event3, C2 is not guaranteed by the constraints. (Even if one interprets ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"" as eventual rather than immediate, Event3 could still be omitted entirely by going straight to Event2 when required; the constraints do not force Event3 to ever occur.)

Conclusion

- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (event2 is required at some later point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- One allowed sequence: initial event1, then immediately event2, and then no further events (since after event2 nothing can happen). This satisfies ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and the ""after event2, no other events"" rule.
- In that sequence, C1 is false at the initial state (the next state has event2, not event3), and there are no later states in which C1 could become true. So C2 is false in this model.
- Because the context permits such a sequence, C2 is not guaranteed to hold in all models (it is not entailed).

- We must decide whether C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context. C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the next event must be event1 or event2.
- After event1, the next event must be event2 or event3.
- After event2, the next event must be event1 or event3.

Step 3 — look for a counterexample to C1
- Starting from the initial event3, choose event1 next (allowed).
- From event1 choose event3 next (allowed).
- Repeat: event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ...
- This infinite trace obeys all rules and never includes event2.

Since there is a valid sequence in which event2 never happens, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (requires C1) is also false, even though event3 does happen initially.

Final answer:
False
---
We must check whether ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) and therefore whether ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" (C2) follows from the context.

1. From the context: initially event3 occurred. The rules say after any occurrence of event3, either event1 or event2 must happen; after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen; after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. (One of the ""after event3"" lines is repeated but gives the same choice.)

2. These are nondeterministic obligations (""either ... or ... must happen""), so at each step there may be a choice between the two listed events.

3. Produce a valid sequence that avoids event2 entirely: start with event3 (given), then choose event1 (allowed after event3), then choose event3 (allowed after event1), then choose event1 again, and so on: event3, event1, event3, event1, ... This sequence satisfies all rules but never has event2.

4. Therefore C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not guaranteed by the context (it can be false in a valid run). Since C1 can be false, C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is not entailed.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" (i.e., event3 happens AND event2 always happens).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the conditions.

- Initially event3 occurred.
- After event3, the next event must be event1 or event2.
- After event1, the next event must be event2 or event3.
- After event2, the next event must be event1 or event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: event3 (given).
- Choose next = event1 (allowed). From event1 choose next = event3 (allowed). From event3 choose next = event1 (allowed). This yields the infinite sequence 3,1,3,1,... which never includes event2 but respects all rules.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence in which event2 never occurs, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (which requires C1) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts that C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") is always true.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" — this is exactly the implication event2 → event1 (whenever event2 happens, event1 follows).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" and ""After event3, event2 must happen."" are additional rules but do not contradict the previous rule.

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is unconditional, so in every situation where event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.
- Therefore the conditional C1 holds in all cases allowed by the context.

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (i.e. event2 → event1)
- C2: C1 always holds.

Step 2 — restate the given conditions as implications:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (event3 → event2)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → event1)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (event1 → event2)

Step 3 — compare hypothesis to the conditions:
- The condition ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is exactly C1 (event2 → event1). That rule is explicitly given, so C1 is entailed by the context.

Step 4 — determine whether C1 always holds:
- There is no statement in the context that contradicts or limits the rule event2 → event1. Therefore C1 holds in all situations allowed by the context.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens.  
- C2: C1 always holds.

Step 2 — examine the context rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.  (This is exactly C1.)
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is stated explicitly and unqualified, so whenever event2 happens, event1 must follow.
- The other rules do not contradict or restrict that rule (they in fact create a mutual obligation between event1 and event2), so the rule holds in all cases allowed by the context.

Conclusion
- C1 is entailed by the context and therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is ""event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some point in the future both event1 and event2 will have occurred).
We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- Initially, event3 has happened (so the timeline starts with event3 having occurred).
- After event3, no other events can happen (explicit rule).
- The other rules (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event3) only apply if event1 or event2 occur.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- Because event3 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event3, no other events can happen"" prevents any further occurrences of event1 or event2 at any later time.
- Therefore event1 and event2 cannot occur after the initial state, so C1 cannot become true in the future.
- (If event1 and event2 had already happened before the initial state, that would have been stated; given ""Initially, event3 happened"" we take only event3 as holding initially.)

Conclusion:
- C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true or false, where C1 is ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- Also: after event1 → event2 must happen, and after event2 → event3 must happen (these impose constraints if event1 or event2 were to occur).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event3 has already happened initially and after event3 no further events can occur, no event (including event1 or event2) can ever happen afterward.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen, and event2 cannot happen at any future time.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C1 requires event1 and event2 to happen, and neither can occur, C1 never holds, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — restate goal
- C2 says that eventually C1 holds, where C1 = ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the context rules
- Initially, Event3 has happened.
- After Event3, no other events can happen. (So once Event3 has occurred, the system is terminal.)
- Also: after Event1 → Event2 must happen, and after Event2 → Event3 must happen. (These imply sequences if Event1 or Event2 ever occur.)

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- Because Event3 has already happened initially, we are already in the state ""after Event3.""
- The rule ""after Event3, no other events can happen"" prevents Event1 (and therefore Event2) from occurring at any later time.
- Thus Event1 cannot happen, so C1 (""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"") can never become true.

Conclusion
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" gives two possible continuations.
  - If event1 happens next, then ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" so the sequence is event3 → event1 → event2. In this case both event1 and event2 occur, so C1 holds.
  - If event2 happens next, then ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" so the sequence is event3 → event2 and event1 cannot occur afterwards. In this case C1 does not hold.
- Because there is a valid continuation (event3 → event2) in which C1 never holds, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold.

Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens and event1 happens (i.e., both events occur).
- C2: Eventually C1 holds (i.e., at some future point both event1 and event2 have happened).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (one of them).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- If event2 happens, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Trace possible sequences starting from the initial event3:
- Case A: After event3, event2 happens. Because event2 is terminal, event1 cannot happen afterward. So C1 does not hold in this run.
- Case B: After event3, event1 happens. Then event2 must happen (by the rule after event1), so both event1 and event2 occur in this run, and C1 holds.

Since there exists a possible future (Case A) where C1 never holds, C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., eventually both event1 and event2 have occurred.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (a choice).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen later.
- If event2 happens, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Sequence A: event3 → event2. This is allowed by ""after event3, either event1 or event2""; after event2 nothing can happen, so event1 never happens. C1 is false in this sequence.
- Sequence B: event3 → event1 → event2. This is also allowed (after event3 choose event1, then after event1 event2 must happen). C1 is true in this sequence.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds. Because there is at least one allowed sequence (Sequence A) where event1 never happens, C1 does not necessarily eventually hold in all executions.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed/necessarily true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" (i.e., both that event3 will eventually happen and that event3 does happen)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So from the initial event1, event3 will occur (at some later time).
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
These last three rules form a cycle: event1 → event3 → event2 → event1 → ...

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: event1 has happened.
- Therefore, event3 must happen (by the rule after event1).
- After that event3, event2 must happen, then event1, and the cycle repeats. So event3 does indeed occur (and recurs).

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 is true (event3 eventually happens).
- The second part of C2, ""event3 happens"", is also satisfied (we have derived that event3 does occur).
- Therefore C2, which requires both C1 and that event3 happens, is satisfied.

Final answer: True

---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 asserts: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" (C1 itself is ""Event3 eventually happens"".)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened.
- Rules: after event1 → event3 must happen; after event3 → event2 must happen; after event2 → event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event1 has happened and ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" event3 will (eventually) occur.
- That makes C1 true.
- Moreover, since event3 does indeed occur (follows from the initial event1 and the rule), the conjunct ""event3 happens"" is also true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Both parts of C2 are satisfied, so C2 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds. C1 says ""Event2 happens and event3 happens."" So C2 claims: in every allowed sequence (given the context), both event2 and event3 occur.

Step 2 — conditions:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event2 → either event1 or event3. (This is repeated but same rule.)

Step 3 — trace / counterexample:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Choose after event2 → event1 (allowed).
- After event1 → choose event2 (allowed).
- After event2 → choose event1 (allowed).
- Repeat indefinitely: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
  In this sequence event3 never occurs, while event2 does occur (initially and repeatedly).

Since there is an allowed sequence where event3 does not happen, C1 does not hold in all possible sequences. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 happens and event3 happens (i.e., both events occur).
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible allowed sequence, both event2 and event3 occur).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- Transition rules (after any event X, the next event must be one of the other two): after 1 → {2 or 3}, after 2 → {1 or 3}, after 3 → {1 or 2}.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- From the initial event2, one allowed continuation is 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → … repeatedly. This satisfies all transition rules but never includes event3.
- In that allowed sequence, event3 never happens, so C1 (both event2 and event3 happen) does not hold in every possible run.

Conclusion:
- C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 is the proposition ""Event2 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible execution both event2 and event3 occur).
- From the context: initially event2 happens. The rules are transition constraints:
  - After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
  - After event1, the next must be event2 or event3.
  - After event3, the next must be event1 or event2.
- Starting from the initial event2, it is allowed to choose event1 next. From event1 one may choose event2 again, and so on. Thus there is an execution that alternates event2, event1, event2, event1, ... and never produces event3.
- In that execution C1 is false (event3 never happens), so C1 is not guaranteed in all executions.

Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds.
We must decide whether C2 is true (i.e., guaranteed by the given conditions).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened → C1 is already satisfied.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (choice).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event1 leads back to event3).
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Start: event3 (given).
- From that event3 the system must choose either event1 or event2.
  - If it chooses event2, then event2 happens and the run ends; C2 would be true in that run.
  - If it chooses event1, then event3 must happen next, returning to the same choice point (event3 → either event1 or event2). The system can repeatedly choose event1 every time, producing an infinite loop event3→event1→event3→event1→... and never produce event2.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Event2 is possible but not inevitable. C1 is guaranteed (event3 already occurred), but C2 requires event2 to happen as well. Because there exists a valid execution that never produces event2, C2 is not guaranteed by the conditions.

Final answer:
False
---
The hypothesis C2 says: ""Event2 happens and Event3 eventually happens.""

Step-by-step:

- From the context, initially event3 happened, so C1 (event3 eventually happens) is satisfied.
- After any occurrence of event3, the system must do either event1 or event2.
- If the system always chooses event1 after event3, then after event1 event3 must happen again, and this can repeat indefinitely: event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ...
  This infinite trace never includes event2.
- Thus event2 is possible but not guaranteed by the rules (there exist valid executions without event2).

Because event2 does not necessarily happen, C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is not guaranteed. Final answer:

False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C2 requires (a) Event2 happens and (b) C1 holds (C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens"").
- From the context, Event3 initially happened, so C1 is satisfied.
- But after any Event3, the next event can be either Event1 or Event2. If Event1 is chosen, then Event3 must happen again, and this can repeat indefinitely (Event3 → Event1 → Event3 → ...). That infinite loop never forces Event2 to occur.
- Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules in which Event2 never happens, we cannot conclude Event2 must happen. Therefore C2 (which requires Event2 to happen) is not guaranteed."

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is being asked: whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context.

2. Examine C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (always true). So C1 holds in every model consistent with the context.

3. Therefore C2 simplifies to just ""event1 happens"" (since the antecedent C1 is always true, C1 -> event1 is equivalent to event1).

4. Use the context to check whether event1 must happen:
   - Initially, event3 happened.
   - After event3, no other events can happen. That makes the initial event3 a terminal event; no event1 can occur either before or after (given the phrasing ""initially"" and the terminality).
   - Thus event1 does not happen in any model consistent with the context.

5. Since C2 requires event1 to hold but event1 does not hold, C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 is the claim: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
- C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the context rules
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So once event3 has occurred, the timeline stops; no event1 or event2 can occur after that.)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (Not needed further because event2 cannot occur after the initial event3.)
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event3 happened initially and no events can happen after event3, neither event1 nor event2 can ever occur in any allowed sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""if event2 happens then event2 happens"") is true (it is a tautology and/or vacuously true in our models because event2 never occurs).
- C2 (""if C1 holds then event1 happens""): the antecedent C1 does hold, but event1 does not happen in any allowed sequence. So the implication C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine C1
C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (always true), so C1 holds in every situation.

Step 3 — use the context to see if event1 must happen
The context says initially event3 happened, and ""after event3, no other events can happen."" That means no events (including event1) can occur after the initial event3. There is therefore no way for event1 to occur in any permitted sequence.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
C1 does hold, but event1 does not (and cannot) happen given the context. So the implication ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 asserts two things: (a) event3 happens, and (b) C1 holds (C1: if event3 happens then event1 happens). We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (and if event2 happens then event1 must follow).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event2 initially happened, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur next.
- Once event1 has occurred, ""no other events can happen"" prevents any further events, so event3 cannot occur after the initial event2→event1 sequence.
- The alternative that event3 happened before the initial state is not allowed because the context states event2 happened initially (the timeline begins with event2).

Step 4 — conclusion about C1 and C2:
- C1 (if event3 then event1) is entailed by the rules: after event3 either event1 occurs directly or event2 occurs and then event1 must follow, so C1 is true.
- C2 requires that event3 happens; but given the initial event2 and the forced event1 that follows, event3 cannot happen. Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (event3 → (event1 ∨ event2))
- After event2, event1 must happen. (event2 → event1)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal)

Step 3 — reason about C1:
- From event3 → (event1 ∨ event2) and event2 → event1, if event3 occurs then either event1 occurs directly or event2 occurs and then (by event2 → event1) event1 occurs. So event3 → event1 is entailed. Therefore C1 holds.

Step 4 — reason about whether event3 happens:
- Initially event2 happened. From event2 → event1, event1 then must happen.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so no further events (including event3) can occur after the initial event2 → event1 sequence.
- The context does not state that event3 happened initially or before event2; it states event2 happened initially. Therefore event3 does not occur in the given scenario.

Step 5 — conclusion about C2:
- C2 requires event3 to happen and C1 to hold. While C1 does hold, event3 does not happen under the given facts. So C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypotheses
- C1: If event3 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: Event3 happens and C1 holds (i.e., C2 is the conjunction: ""event3 happens"" ∧ C1).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the initial event2, event1 must occur, and once event1 occurs nothing else can happen. Therefore no event3 can occur after the initial event2.
- Could event3 have happened before the initial event2? The statement ""Initially, event2 happened"" fixes the starting point as event2, so there is no prior event3. Hence, in the scenario described, event3 does not happen.
- Independently, if event3 did happen, the rules force either event1 or event2 afterward; and if event2 occurs then, event1 must follow, so in every case event1 would happen. Thus C1 is entailed by the rules.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C1 is true (entailed), but ""event3 happens"" is false in the given scenario.
- Therefore the conjunction C2 (""event3 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: Event2 happens or event3 happens.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So whenever event1 happens, event2 will happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event2 is terminal.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Event3 is also terminal if it ever occurs.)

Step 3 — Reason about sequences
- Because event1 happens and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does happen.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 or event3"") is true (specifically because event2 happens).

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2
- C2 states: if event1 happens, then C1 holds. Given event1 does happen and that entails event2 (making C1 true), the conditional is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds.
- C1: event2 happens or event3 happens.

So we must check whether whenever event1 happens, at least one of event2 or event3 will happen.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 does happen.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Event2 is required following event1.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Sequence ends after event2.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Sequence would also end after event3, but this doesn't apply here because event3 is not forced after event1.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence when event1 happens:
- Because event1 happened (and ""after event1, event2 must happen""), event2 will occur.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 or event3"") is satisfied (specifically, event2 happens).

Conclusion:
- Whenever event1 happens, C1 holds. Thus C2 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the statement: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"", where C1 is ""event2 happens or event3 happens"".
- So we must decide whether, given the context, whenever event1 happens it follows that (event2 or event3) happens.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen in the scenario.
- After event1, event2 must happen. That is a requirement: if event1 happens then event2 follows.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Because event1 happens and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 indeed happens.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 or event3"") is true (event2 holds).
- The fact that after event2 no further events can happen or that event3 would block others is irrelevant to the implication: once event1 occurs, event2 necessarily occurs, so C1 is satisfied.

Conclusion
- The implication ""If event1 happens, then (event2 or event3)"" is guaranteed by the premises.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis parts:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e., Event3 happens OR Event1 does not happen)

Step 2 — examine context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen (C1 is false).
- After event1, event3 must happen. Since event1 occurred, event3 therefore happens.
- After event3, no other events can happen (this only restricts anything after event3; it does not prevent event3 itself).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is true if either event3 happens or C1 holds.
- We already have event3 happens, so C2 is true (C1 is false but not needed).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true, therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- After event1, event3 must happen. Since event1 happened, event3 happens (event3 is true).
- After event3, no other events can happen (this doesn't prevent event3 itself).

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 = (event3 happens) OR (C1). We have event3 = true, C1 = false, so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" (so C2 is true iff Event3 happens or Event1 does not happen)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So Event1 does happen.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (So Event3 will occur following that initial Event1.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Event3 is terminal.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant unless event2 occurs; nothing says it does.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because Event1 happened initially, C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- From the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" Event3 does happen.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Since Event3 does happen, C2 is true (regardless of C1).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens."" Interpreted as a conjunction holding at a single moment (both events true at the same state/time).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That asks whether there will be some future moment when both event3 and event2 hold simultaneously.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened (so at time t0, event3 occurs).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so some t1 > t0 with event2).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so some t2 > t1 with event3).
- After event1, event2 must happen — irrelevant because event1 never appears in the trace.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- t0: event3 occurs.
- By the rule, at some later time t1 we must have event2.
- By the rule again, at some later time t2 > t1 we must have event3.
- This enforces an alternating sequence ... event3, event2, event3, event2, ... where each required event happens strictly after the previous one.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Because each event must occur after the other, there is no moment where both event3 and event2 occur simultaneously. Therefore the conjunction C1 never holds at a single time, so C1 does not eventually hold.

(If “happens” were interpreted as “has happened at some time in the past or present,” then after t1 both have occurred and one could claim C1 has held — but under the usual reading that the conjunction must hold at one instant, it does not.)

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens."" (i.e., both events occur at some points in the timeline)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., eventually both event3 and event2 have happened)

Step 2 — restate the constraints:
- Initially, event3 has happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen (so from any occurrence of event3, an event2 will occur later).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 leads to a later event3).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant unless event1 occurs; nothing forces event1 here).

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- Since event3 already happened initially, the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces an event2 to occur later.
- Thus both event3 (already occurred) and event2 (will occur) happen in the timeline, so C1 is satisfied.
- Therefore C1 will hold (indeed, as soon as that forced event2 occurs), so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., both events occur at least once).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., eventually both event3 and event2 will have happened.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened (so event3 has already occurred).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so an occurrence of event3 forces a subsequent occurrence of event2).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so an occurrence of event2 forces a subsequent occurrence of event3).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant unless event1 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0: event3 occurred (given).
- By ""after event3, event2 must happen"" → event2 will occur next.
- Once event2 occurs, by ""after event2, event3 must happen"" → event3 will occur next.
- This produces an alternating sequence event3, event2, event3, event2, ... so both events occur (and continue to occur).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since event3 already occurred and event2 must occur immediately after, both events do occur; therefore C1 holds (indeed it holds immediately/soon), so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the formulas:
- C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (relative to the current state)
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: in the next state, C1 is true; equivalently, event3 happens in two steps from now.

Step 2 — follow the context rules from the initial state (call it state0):
- Initially (state0) event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, event3 must happen → so state1: event3. Thus C1 is true at state0 (event3 occurs in the next state).
- Rule: after event3, event2 must happen → so state2: event2.
- Therefore, at state1, the next state (state2) has event2, not event3; C1 is false at state1.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 at the initial state:
- C2 says C1 holds in the next state (i.e., C1 is true at state1).
- But we found C1 is false at state1 (because state2 has event2).
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, it is true that ""Event3 happens in that state's next state"" (so C2 asserts event3 happens two steps ahead).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially (time t0) event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen (so at t1).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so at t2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at t3).
Thus the sequence starting at t0 is: t0: event1, t1: event3, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial state (t0)
- C1 at t0: ""event3 happens in the next state"" → true, because event3 occurs at t1.
- C2 at t0: requires that C1 is true at t1 — i.e., that event3 occurs at t2. But at t2 we have event2, not event3. So C1 is false at t1, and therefore C2 is false at t0.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (evaluated at the current state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., at the next state, it should be true that event3 happens in that state's next state.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False at the initial state.

Step 2 — apply the conditions / rules
- Initially (state 0): event1 happened.
- After event1 → event3 in the next state.
- After event3 → event2 in the next state.
- After event2 → event1 in the next state.

Step 3 — trace the sequence of events
- State 0: event1 (given).
- State 1 (next): event3 (from event1 at state 0).
- State 2: event2 (from event3 at state 1).
- State 3: event1 (from event2 at state 2).
- State 4: event3 (from event1 at state 3), and so on.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that at state 1, C1 is true. C1 at state 1 says: ""event3 happens in state 2.""
- But at state 2 the event is event2, not event3.
- Therefore C1 is false at state 1, so C2 is false at the initial state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis: C2 says that at some point C1 holds, i.e. both event2 and event3 happen (event2 happens and event3 happens).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 must occur next/after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Trace possible sequences:
- Because event1 is initial and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 will occur and (by the “after event2” rule) nothing can occur afterwards.
- That leaves no opportunity for event3 to occur either before the initial event1 (impossible because event1 is initial) or after event2 (forbidden).
- The only way to have both event3 and event2 would be to have event3 before event2, but event1 is initial and forces event2 next, so event3 cannot come in between.

Therefore it is impossible for both event2 and event3 to occur. C1 cannot ever hold, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C1 is ""event2 happens and event3 happens."" C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some point both event2 and event3 have occurred.

- From the context:
  1. Initially event1 happened (so event1 is the first/initial event).
  2. After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur following the initial event1).
  3. After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
  4. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

- Because event2 is terminal, no events can occur after event2. Since event1 already occurs initially, the only way to have event3 and event2 both occur in a trace would be for event3 to occur before event2. But any event occurring after the initial event1 must still allow event2 to occur, and nothing can occur after event2 — there is no place for event3 to occur after the initial event1 without violating the obligations. Event3 cannot occur before the initial event1 (the initial state is the earliest point).

- Therefore there is no valid execution in which both event2 and event3 happen. Hence C1 cannot become true in any future, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event3 happens"".
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = ""eventually both event2 and event3 happen"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs, the run ends).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (this only constrains what must follow an event3; it does not force event3 to occur).

Step 3 — possible traces and a counterexample:
- One valid trace consistent with the constraints is: event1 → event2 → end. This meets ""after event1 event2 must happen"" and ""after event2 no other events"", and it never contains event3.
- In that trace C1 (both event2 and event3 happen) does not hold, so C1 does not inevitably occur.

Conclusion:
- C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions. Therefore: False."

So we're asked whether at some point in the future either event1 or event3 will occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the occurrence of event2 prevents any further events).
- The other rules (after event1 → event3 must happen; after event3 → event1 or event2 must happen) only matter if event1 or event3 ever occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since event2 has happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, the only possible execution is: event2 (initial) and then no more events.
- In that execution, neither event1 nor event3 ever occurs.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event3 or event1 happens"") never becomes true in that execution.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point, event3 or event1 will occur).
The question: is C2 true?

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, the system has no further events.)
- The other rules (""after event1 → event3"" and ""after event3 → event1 or event2"") only matter if event1 or event3 actually occur.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- We start with event2 and, by the second condition, no further events can ever occur after that.
- Therefore event1 and event3 never occur at any time.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- C1 (""event3 or event1 happens"") never becomes true.
- Hence C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" (which is logically equivalent to ""Event3 happens"").
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"", i.e. ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens"".
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Examine the conditions in the context:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event3 must happen.
- After Event3, Event1 must happen.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen.
These rules form a cycle: Event2 → Event3 → Event1 → Event2 → ...

Trace the sequence:
- Since Event2 happened initially, the rule ""after Event2, Event3 must happen"" implies Event3 happens.
- Given Event3 happens and ""after Event3, Event1 must happen"", Event1 happens as well.
- So both Event3 and Event1 occur (and the cycle can continue).

Conclusion:
- C1 (Event3 happens) is true.
- Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens or Event3 happens"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 happens and event3 happens (equivalent to ""Event3 happens"").
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds (equivalent to ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens"").

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event3 must happen → from the initial Event2 we get Event3.
- After Event3, Event1 must happen → once Event3 occurs, Event1 occurs.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen → this loops back to Event2, which then forces Event3 again, etc.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: Event2 (given).
- Then Event3 (from Event2).
- Then Event1 (from Event3).
- Then Event2 again (from Event1), and the cycle repeats.
So Event3 and Event1 both happen (indeed repeatedly).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because Event3 happens.
- C2 is true because Event1 happens (and also because C1 holds).

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 = ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" (equivalent to ""Event3 happens"").
- C2 = ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" i.e. ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the context/rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
These rules create a cycle: 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → ...

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Starting from the initial event2, event3 must occur next.
- After that event1 must occur.
- The cycle repeats, so event3 and event1 both do occur (in fact repeatedly).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- Since event3 occurs, C1 is true.
- Therefore ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Short answer: True.

Reasoning (concise): Initially event2 happens, so event3 must happen next. After that, we may choose event1 (the rule allows either event1 or event2). Choosing event1 yields the sequence: event2 -> event3 -> event1. That sequence makes event3 happen and event1 happen (so C1 holds), and thus C2 holds. Note C2 is satisfiable (though not forced in every possible sequence).
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1 = (event1 happens) AND (event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (event3 happens) — which is equivalent to (event1 happens) AND (event3 happens) (event3 is just repeated).

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event3 must happen → so event3 does occur (at least once).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One allowed sequence is: event2 → event3 → event1. This satisfies C2 (both event3 and event1 occur).
- But another allowed sequence is: event2 → event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ... (repeating). In this case event1 never happens.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists an allowed execution where event1 does not occur, C2 (which requires event1) is not guaranteed by the rules.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: Event1 happens and Event3 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and Event3 happens — i.e. equivalently Event1 happens and Event3 happens (Event3 is repeated).

Step 2 — examine the constraints
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event3 must happen. So Event3 does happen (at least once).
- After Event3, either Event1 or Event2 must happen (choice).
- After Event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One possible sequence: Event2 → Event3 → Event1. This satisfies C1 (and thus C2).
- Another possible sequence: Event2 → Event3 → Event2 → Event3 → ... (repeating). This never produces Event1, so C1 and C2 are false in that run.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because the constraints allow runs where Event1 never happens, C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is not entailed (not necessarily true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Hypothesis: C1 = “Event3 happens and event1 happens.” C2 = “C1 always holds” (i.e., on every possible future trace, both event3 and event1 occur).

2. From the rules:
   - Initially event1 has happened (so event1 does occur in the initial state).
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, there is a nondeterministic choice: either event1 or event3.
   - After event3, there is a choice: either event1 or event2.

3. There are multiple possible traces. One valid trace is:
   1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... (always choose event1 after event2).
   In this trace event3 never occurs, although event1 does (initially and repeatedly).

4. Because there exists a valid trace in which event3 does not happen, C1 is not true on all traces. Therefore C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every allowed sequence of events, both event3 and event1 occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event1 has happened (so ""event1 happens"" is already true).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 happens.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 happens.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: event1 → (must) event2.
- From event2 we may choose event1. That gives event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... indefinitely.
- This infinite alternating sequence contains event1 and event2 only; event3 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence in which event3 never happens, C1 is not guaranteed in every sequence (event1 is guaranteed initially, but event3 is not).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every possible continuation, both event3 and event1 occur)

Examine the rules:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (choice).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (choice).

Construct a valid continuation that violates C1:
- Start: event1 (given).
- Then event2 (must).
- After that, always choose event1 (allowed by the rule after event2).
- Then event2, then event1, then event2, … — this infinite loop event1 ↔ event2 never produces event3.

In that continuation event1 does occur (indeed repeatedly) but event3 never occurs, so C1 (""event3 happens and event1 happens"") does not hold in that possible sequence. Therefore C1 does not always hold.

Identify the question
- C2 says ""C1 does not hold"", i.e. ""It is not the case that Event2 does not happen"" — equivalently, ""Event2 does happen.""
Examine the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen → since event1 happened, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen → since event3 must happen, event2 must happen.
- (After event2, event1 must happen is consistent with the cycle but not needed to derive event2.)
Trace the sequence
- event1 (initial) → event3 (must) → event2 (must).
Conclusion
- Event2 must happen, so C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false, therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is True.

True

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:

- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- (Also: after event2, event1 must happen, completing a cycle.)

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Since event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to happen.
- Once event3 happens, the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to happen.

Conclusion:
- Event2 does happen, so C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false, and C2 (its negation) is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at all times, event1 does not happen).
You are asked whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So at the initial moment, event1 did occur.
- The other statements about ""after eventX, no other events can happen"" are irrelevant to whether event1 occurred initially.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 asserts event1 does not happen. That is false because the context explicitly says event1 happened initially.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Since C1 is already false at the initial moment, C2 cannot be true (it fails at least at that time).

Conclusion:
False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The context states explicitly that initially event1 happened — so event1 does occur.
2. C1 asserts ""Event1 does not happen."" That contradicts the given fact, so C1 is false (it does not hold at the initial moment).
3. C2 asserts ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at all times event1 does not happen). Since C1 is already false at the initial time, it cannot always hold.
4. Therefore C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur at the initial moment.
- The other sentences (after event1/event2/event3, no other events can happen) restrict subsequent events but do not negate that event1 already happened.

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is directly contradicted by the context statement that event1 happened initially. So C1 is false (it does not hold at least at the initial moment).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means C1 must be true at all times. Because C1 is already false at the initial moment, C2 cannot be true.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: event3 (given), then event2 (forced).
- From event2 we may choose event3 again. After that, event2 must follow, and we can repeat event3→event2 indefinitely.
- That infinite loop (event3, event2, event3, event2, ...) satisfies all rules but never includes event1.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event3 does occur (initially), but event1 is not guaranteed (there is a valid run that never contains event1).
- Therefore C1 does not hold in all possible runs, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is the proposition ""Event1 happens and Event3 happens"" (i.e., both hold).
- C2 asserts ""C1 always holds"" — that at all times (in the initial state and all reachable states) both Event1 and Event3 are true.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event3 happened (so Event3 is true initially).
- There is no statement that Event1 happened initially.
- The transition rules constrain what must happen after events, but do not force Event1 to be true at the initial moment.

Step 3 — find a counterexample:
- At the initial state Event3 is true but Event1 is not stated to be true. Therefore C1 (""Event1 and Event3"") is already false in the initial state.
- Since C1 fails at the initial state, it cannot ""always hold.""

Conclusion:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" (i.e., both occur at some points in the run).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — meaning in every possible sequence of events allowed by the context, C1 is true.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event3 occurs.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace a possible sequence
Start with the required initial and mandatory steps, and always pick event3 when given the choice after event2:
3 (initial) → 2 (must after 3) → 3 (choose 3 after 2) → 2 → 3 → 2 → ...
This infinite sequence satisfies all rules, and event1 never occurs in it.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
Because there exists a valid sequence where event1 never happens (even though event3 does), C1 is not true in every possible sequence. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens"". So C2 asks: in the next state, does Event1 or Event3 hold?

Examine the initial condition and rules
- Initially (state0) Event3 happened.
- Rules:
  - After Event1 → Event3 must happen (at some subsequent step; interpreted as the next relevant step).
  - After Event3 → Event2 must happen.
  - After Event2 → Event3 must happen.

Trace the sequence
- At state0 Event3 holds.
- By ""after Event3 → Event2 must happen"", in the next state (state1) Event2 must hold.
- Nothing forces Event1 to occur in state1, and Event3 is not required in state1 (it will be required after Event2, i.e., in state2).
- Therefore in state1 we have Event2, but neither Event1 nor Event3 is guaranteed to hold.

Conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 or Event3"") does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.

False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning:
1. Hypothesis C1 = ""event1 happens or event3 happens."" C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one.
2. From the context: initially event3 happened. The rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces the next state to have event2.
3. In that next state we therefore have event2 (and not event1 or event3). That makes C1 false in the next state.
4. Hence C2 is False.
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happens.
- By the rules: after event3 → event2; after event2 → event3. So the sequence from the initial state is: initial (event3) → next (event2) → next (event3) → ...
- C1 is ""event1 or event3"". In the next state (the immediate successor), event2 happens, so neither event1 nor event3 holds there.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis C1 is just ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant). C2 is ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"" — so C2 is true exactly when both event1 and event2 occur.

- From the context:
  - Initially event1 has already happened.
  - After event1, event3 must happen (so some event3 must occur after the initial event1).
  - After event3, event1 must happen (so every time event3 occurs, a subsequent event1 must occur).
  - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

- Because event1 forces event3, and event3 forces event1, these obligations create an ongoing requirement that event3 and then event1 must occur after the initial event1. If event2 were to occur at any time, it would stop all further events and thus prevent the required subsequent event3 or event1 from occurring, violating the obligations. Therefore event2 cannot occur in any sequence that satisfies the given constraints.

- So Event2 does not happen (C1 is false). Event1 does happen (initially), but C2 requires event2 as well, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — i.e. both Event1 and Event2 happen.

Step 2 — understand the context rules
- Initially, Event1 has happened.
- After Event1, Event3 must happen (so at some later time after any Event1, an Event3 must occur).
- After Event3, Event1 must happen (so Event1 and Event3 force each other to occur alternately thereafter).
- After Event2, no other events can happen (Event2, if it occurs, must be the last event).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Since Event1 happened initially, the rule ""after Event1, Event3 must happen"" forces an Event3 later.
- After that Event3, the rule forces another Event1, and so on — this enforces (potentially) an unbroken alternation of Event1 and Event3 after the initial Event1.
- If Event2 were to occur at any time after the initial Event1, it would forbid any further events, which would prevent the required future Event3 (or Event1 after an Event3), violating the rules. Therefore Event2 cannot occur after the initial Event1.
- There is no time before the initial Event1 for Event2 to occur (initial means Event1 happened first), so Event2 cannot occur at all under these constraints.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Event1 does happen (true), but Event2 cannot happen under the given rules. Thus C1 is false, and so C2 (""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens."" We must decide whether C2 is true (i.e., follows from the given context).

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (Every occurrence of event1 obliges a later event3.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (Every occurrence of event3 obliges a later event1.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 would be terminal.)

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Because event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces an event3 sometime later.
- That event3 in turn forces another event1 later, which forces another event3, and so on — an ongoing obligation to alternate event1 and event3 indefinitely.
- If event2 were to occur at any time, it would forbid any events after it. But the alternating obligations from prior event1/event3 occurrences require further events after any given point. Placing event2 at any time would therefore prevent required future events and violate the given rules.
- There is no rule that requires event2 to happen at any time, and the constraints on event1/event3 actually prevent inserting event2 without breaking the obligations.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event1 is entailed by the context, but Event2 is not entailed (and in fact cannot occur without violating the other rules). Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"") is not true.

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis: C2 = (Event3 happens) AND (C1 holds), where C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens.""

Examine the rules:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- After event2, the next event must be event1.
- After event3, the next event must be either event1 or event2.

We must check whether C2 is guaranteed in all possible valid event sequences.

Find a counterexample sequence that satisfies the rules but falsifies C2. Starting from the initial event1, take event3 next, then always choose event1 after event3 and event3 after event1:

Sequence: 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, ...
This sequence obeys all rules (1→3 allowed, 3→1 allowed) and contains event3, but never contains event2. Therefore C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is false in this trace, so C2 is false in this trace.

Because there exists a valid sequence where C2 is false, C2 is not entailed by the premises.

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens"") follows from the given rules.

Step 1 — restate rules
- Initially event1 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must occur (nondeterministically).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must occur (nondeterministically).

Step 2 — check whether C2 is guaranteed
- From the initial event1, the next event could be event3. After event3 the next event could be event1. After that event1 could again lead to event3, and so on.
- There is a valid infinite execution: event1, event3, event1, event3, ... in which event2 never occurs. In that execution C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false, so C2 is false.
- Although some executions do include event2 (so C1 can hold in some runs), the rules do not force event2 to occur in every possible execution.

Conclusion: C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed) by the rules. Answer: False.
---
You are asking whether C2 (""Event3 happens and Event2 eventually happens"") is necessarily true given the rules. Step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis: C2 asserts both that event3 occurs at some point and event2 eventually occurs (C1).

2. Understand the rules:
   - Initially event1 has happened.
   - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice each time).
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

3. Reason about possible sequences:
   - From the initial event1, we may choose event2 next; that would make event2 occur (so C1 holds in that run). But C2 additionally requires event3; nothing forces event3 to ever occur — after each event1 the choice could always be event2, avoiding event3 forever.
   - Alternatively, from the initial event1 we may choose event3 next, and then choose event1 after that, and repeat: 1,3,1,3,... This infinite alternating sequence satisfies all rules but never produces event2, so C1 fails and thus C2 fails in that run.

4. Conclusion: Because there exists a valid sequence (e.g., 1,3,1,3,...) in which event2 never happens and/or event3 might never happen in other valid sequences, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- We must decide whether the statement C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (so no events occur after that initial event3).
- After event1, event3 must happen. (This is exactly C1.)
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate C1
- The context explicitly gives ""After event1, event3 must happen"", so C1 holds (the rule is true).
- Because event3 already happened initially and nothing can happen after it, event1 and event2 do not occur in the actual sequence.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""
- The antecedent (C1 holds) is true.
- The consequent (event2 happens) is false in the context (event2 does not happen).
- Therefore the implication is false (true antecedent with false consequent).

First identify what's being asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Evaluate C1:
- C1 says ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens."" That exactly matches ""After event1, event3 must happen."" So C1 holds (is true).

Evaluate C2:
- C2 says ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" That asserts event2 must occur whenever the implication C1 is true.
- Nothing in the context links C1 being true to event2 occurring. There is no rule that causes event2 just because C1 holds.
- Moreover, event3 already happened initially and is terminal, so no further events (including event2) can occur.

Conclusion:
- C2 is not supported and is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- We need to decide whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context. C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event3 happens.""

Step 2 — understand the given conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event1 → event3).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event2 → event3).

Step 3 — examine which claims follow from the context
- The context directly entails C1: it explicitly says ""After event1, event3 must happen,"" so C1 is true.
- C2 states: if C1 holds, then event2 happens. That is an implication from a meta-fact (C1) to the occurrence of event2.

Step 4 — trace event sequences and check C2
- Since event3 happened initially and is terminal, no events (including event1 or event2) occur after it. There is no information that event2 occurred earlier; in fact, the initial event was event3, so event2 did not happen at all.
- The fact that C1 holds does not provide any causal or logical reason that event2 must occur. The context gives rules that would force event3 if event2 occurred, but it does not force event2 itself under any condition.

Conclusion
- C2 is not entailed by the context. C1 is true, but that does not make event2 happen, so the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is false.

- C2 = (event1 happens) ∧ C1.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. So once event3 has occurred (and it has, initially), no event1 or event2 can occur afterwards.
- Also: event1 → event3 and event2 → event3 (but these don't enable event1 or event2 to occur earlier than event3).

Step 3 — reason about events:
- Because event3 occurred initially and no events can occur after it, neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any time in this scenario.
- Evaluate C1 (event2 → event1): since event2 never happens in this scenario, the conditional is vacuously true.
- Evaluate C2: it requires event1 to happen. But we just concluded event1 does not happen. So even though C1 holds, the conjunction in C2 fails.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 is simply ""event1 happens"" (event1 ∧ event1 is equivalent to event1).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., event1 is true in the immediate successor state).

Step 2 — apply the conditions to the initial state:
- Initially (state s0): event1 holds.
- Rule: after event1, event3 must happen → in the next state s1, event3 holds.
- Rule: after event3, event1 must happen → in the next state s2, event1 holds.
- The rule about event2 is irrelevant here.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asks whether event1 holds in the next state (s1). From the rules, s1 has event3, not event1.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is simply ""event1 happens"" (event1 ∧ event1 is redundant).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. event1 holds in the state immediately after the initial state.

Step 2 — apply the context rules:
- Initially (state S0): event1 happens.
- ""After event1, event3 must happen"" ⇒ in the next state S1, event3 must hold.
- ""After event3, event1 must happen"" ⇒ in S2, event1 must hold.
- ""After event2, event3 must happen"" is irrelevant here (event2 never appears).

Step 3 — trace the states:
- S0: event1 (given).
- S1: event3 (required by ""after event1 → event3"").
- S2: event1 (required by ""after event3 → event1"").
Thus the immediate next state S1 does not have event1.

Conclusion:
C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1 is just ""event1 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state, i.e. that event1 holds in the immediate successor state.

Step 2 — constraints from the context:
- Initially (state S0) event1 holds.
- After event1, the next state must have event3.
- After event3, the next state must have event1.
- (After event2 → next state has event3, irrelevant here.)

Step 3 — trace from the initial state:
- S0: event1 (given).
- By ""after event1 → event3"", S1 must have event3.
- Nothing forces S1 to have event1 as well; the only required fact for S1 is event3.
- Event1 is guaranteed again at S2 (because S1 has event3), not at S1.

Therefore C2 (event1 holds in the next state S1) is not entailed by the context — a counterexample model is S0={event1}, S1={event3}, S2={event1}, … where C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (event3 eventually happens) AND (event2 happens).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 has already happened).
- After event1, event2 must occur.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must occur.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must occur.

Trace possibilities:
- From the initial event2 you may choose event3 next; then event3 did happen and C1 holds, and since event2 already happened initially, C2 would hold in that run.
- But from the initial event2 you may instead choose event1 next. After event1 you are forced to do event2. From that event2 you can again choose event1, and so on.

Counterexample (an allowed infinite run that avoids event3):
event2 (initial), event1, event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
This sequence respects all rules and never contains event3, so “event3 eventually happens” is not guaranteed.

Conclusion:
C1 (event3 eventually happens) is not entailed by the given conditions, and therefore C2 is not guaranteed. 

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 says: (C1 holds) AND (event2 happens). C1 says event3 eventually happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 has happened (so ""event2 happens"" is already true at the start).
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- One possible continuation after the initial event2 is: event3 occurs next. Then C1 holds, and event2 already happened → C2 holds in this branch.
- But another valid continuation is an infinite loop: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... This satisfies all constraints (after event2 choose event1; after event1 event2 must happen) and never produces event3. In that trace C1 is false (event3 never happens), though event2 does occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because there exists a valid sequence consistent with the constraints in which event3 never occurs, C1 is not guaranteed. Even though event2 does happen (initially), C2 requires C1 as well, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (Event3 eventually happens) AND (Event2 happens).

Step 2 — note given facts and rules:
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is already true.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Starting from the initial event2, one allowed choice is to follow with event1. From event1 you must go to event2, and from that event2 you may again choose event1, etc.
- Thus an infinite sequence event2, event1, event2, event1, ... is allowed by the rules and never contains event3.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because there is a valid execution in which event3 never happens, ""event3 eventually happens"" (C1) is not guaranteed. Since C2 requires C1, C2 is not guaranteed.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" — read as both events occur in the run (not necessarily simultaneously).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there will be a point in the execution where C1 is true (i.e., by that point both event1 and event3 have occurred).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred.
- ""After event1, event3 must happen."" Since event1 has occurred, this forces that event3 will occur later.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" That just makes event3 terminal; it does not prevent event3 from occurring.
- ""After event2, event3 must happen."" Irrelevant unless event2 occurs; it doesn't negate the previous requirement.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- At start: event1 has happened.
- By the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"", event3 will occur at some later point.
- When event3 occurs, both event1 (from the start) and event3 (now) have happened, so C1 holds at that time.

Therefore C1 will eventually hold, so C2 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point both event1 and event3 have occurred).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is already true.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So because event1 occurred, event3 is required to occur at some later time.
- After event3, no other events can happen. That just makes event3 terminal but does not prevent event3 from occurring.
- The rule ""After event2, event3 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event2 occurs; nothing forces event2 to occur.

Step 3 — Trace possible event sequences:
- Start: event1 has occurred.
- By the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" event3 will occur at some future point.
- When event3 occurs, both event1 (already happened) and event3 have happened.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- There is a future point (the moment event3 occurs) at which C1 is true, so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., eventually both event1 and event3 occur).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred.
- ""After event1, event3 must happen."" Since event1 has occurred, this forces event3 to occur (at or after that point).
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" This only limits events after event3; it does not prevent event3 from occurring.
- ""After event2, event3 must happen."" This is irrelevant unless event2 occurs; it does not prevent event3 from occurring when required by event1.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- event1 has occurred initially.
- By the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" event3 will occur sometime after event1.
- Therefore both event1 and event3 occur (C1 holds).

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 says C1 eventually holds. Since C1 does hold (as shown), C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is simply ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction repeats the same fact).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., event2 holds in the state immediately after the current one.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened (so at the current/initial state we have event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so the next state must have event1 or event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, later event3 must follow).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial state (event3), the next state may be event1 or event2.
- If the next state is event2 then C2 would be true. But if the next state is event1, that also satisfies the rules (after event3 choose event1), and then no further events occur.
- Because choosing event1 next is a valid trace, there exists a model where the next state does not have event2.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed by the given conditions (there is a valid trace where C2 is false).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is simply ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction repeats the same literal).
- C2 states that C1 holds in the next state — i.e. that event2 is true in the immediate next state.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 is true (at the current/initial state).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (at some future point).
- After event1, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event2 implies a later event3).

Step 3 — reasoning about the next state
- The rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" requires that at some future time one of them occurs, but it does not force event2 to occur specifically in the immediate next state.
- It is consistent with the rules that the very next state contains event1 (satisfying the ""after event3"" requirement) — and if event1 occurs then no further events occur. That trace satisfies all constraints but makes event2 false in the next state.

Concrete counterexample trace:
- time 0: event3 (given)
- time 1: event1 (allowed by ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"")
- no further events (allowed by ""after event1, no other events can happen"")

In this trace C1 (event2) does not hold in the next state, so C2 is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1 is simply ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"").
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one, event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 happened (state0 = event3).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (so state1 ∈ {event1, event2}).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if state1 = event2, then state2 = event3, etc.).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One allowed sequence: state0 = event3, state1 = event1. This satisfies ""after event3 either event1 or event2"" and then stops (event1 forbids further events).
- In that sequence, the next state (state1) does NOT have event2, so C1 does not hold in the next state.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is an allowed (consistent) successor state where event2 does not occur, C2 is not guaranteed true. Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there is some future point where event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible run / at all times, it is true that event1 will eventually happen (equivalently: every execution has event1 at some point).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So the initial state already has event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred, the execution is terminal — no further events (including event1 or event3) can occur after that.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event3 cannot occur once event2 has occurred.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (Also irrelevant if event1 never occurs.)

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence(s)
- Because event2 has already happened initially and event2 prevents any further events, no future events can occur. In particular, event1 cannot occur at any later time.
- Therefore C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false in the given scenario (there is at least this execution where event1 never occurs).

Conclusion
- Since C1 is not true in the given (initial) execution, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution, event1 eventually happens.
You must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So the initial execution state already has event2.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Thus once event2 has occurred the run is terminal — no further events (including event1) can occur after that.
- Other rules (""After event3, event2 must happen"" and ""After event1, event3 must happen"") don't enable event1 before the initial event2 and in any case cannot occur after event2 because no events can follow event2.

Step 3 — trace possible execution(s)
- The initial execution: event2 has happened, and by the rule no other events can occur thereafter. In this execution, event1 does not happen at any time.
- Therefore there exists at least one execution where C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in every execution, but we have a counterexample (the initial run). Thus C2 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every point in time, Event1 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen; after event3, event2 must happen. (These imply if event1 ever occurs it forces 1→3→2, but that chain requires events after the occurrence.)

Step 3 — trace the possible sequence from the initial condition
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no further events (including event1) can ever occur.
- Therefore, C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is false in this run.

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds, but C1 does not hold (it’s false given the initial event2 and the terminal nature of event2).
- Hence C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 occurs at the start; nothing happens before it.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal: no events can occur later.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Event3 would also be terminal if it occurred.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — what can actually occur
- Because event1 happened initially and is terminal (""after event1 no other events can happen""), no events can occur after event1.
- Since event1 is initial, nothing could have occurred before it. So neither event2 nor event3 can have occurred before event1.
- Therefore neither event2 nor event3 occurs at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens"" — both disjuncts are false, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — both parts are false (event2 doesn't happen, C1 is false), so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event3) OR (event2).
- C2 = (event2) OR C1. So C2 = event2 OR (event3 OR event2) which simplifies to event2 OR event3 (i.e., C2 ≡ C1).

Step 2 — apply the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 has happened initially, no other events (so neither event2 nor event3) can occur afterward.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (it would have to occur after event1, which is forbidden).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- event2 is false and event3 is false under the given constraints, so event2 OR event3 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" where C1 is ""Event3 happens or event2 happens"".
- So C2 is true exactly when event2 or event3 happens.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no other events can occur afterward.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" (irrelevant because event3 cannot occur after the initial event1)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (would require event2 to be followed by event1, but event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after it, so event2 cannot occur after the initial event1)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 has occurred initially and it blocks any subsequent events, neither event2 nor event3 can happen at any later time.
- There is no way to place event2 or event3 so that the constraints are satisfied (they cannot occur after the initial event1).

Conclusion
- Neither event2 nor event3 happens, so C1 is false and therefore C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is just ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""Eventually C1 holds"", i.e. ""Eventually Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes event1 terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events occur.
- The other rules (what must follow after event2 or event3) are irrelevant if event2 or event3 never occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- We start with event1 having happened initially.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, there can be no future occurrence of event2.

Conclusion:
- Event2 cannot eventually happen, so C1 never holds and C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which simplifies to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Eventually Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, the system is terminal; no further events can occur.)
- The other rules (what happens after event2 or event3) only matter if those events ever occur.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Since event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no event2 can ever occur at any later time.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 never happens, so C1 is false and therefore C2 (""eventually Event2 happens"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Eventually, Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- ""After Event1, no other events can happen"" — Event1 is terminal: no future events occur after the initial Event1.
- The other rules (""After Event2, either Event1 or Event3 must happen"" and ""After Event3, either Event1 or Event2 must happen"") only apply if Event2 or Event3 actually occurs.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since Event1 already happened initially and it forbids any further events, there is no opportunity for Event2 to occur at any later time.
- Therefore Event2 never happens.

Conclusion
- C1 is false (Event2 does not happen), so C2 (""eventually Event2 happens"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" We must decide whether C1 is true in all traces allowed by the given rules.

Step 2 — Understand the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (stated twice; same requirement)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences
Start: event3 (given) → then event2 (must).
From that event2 we have two allowed choices:
- Choice A: event2 → event1 (allowed). Then from event1 we can go to event2 or event3.
- Choice B: event2 → event3 (also allowed). From that event3 we must go to event2 again, and we can repeat this cycle forever: event3 → event2 → event3 → event2 → ...

Step 4 — Check C1 against traces
C1 claims every occurrence of event2 is followed (or accompanied) by event1. But Choice B produces an infinite trace in which event2 occurs repeatedly and event1 never occurs (we always choose event3 after event2). That is a valid trace allowed by the rules, so C1 does not hold in all traces.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Hypothesis C1 states: whenever event2 happens, event1 happens.
2. From the conditions we have the transition options:
   - start: event3
   - after event3: event2 (forced)
   - after event2: either event1 or event3
   - after event1: either event2 or event3
3. From event2 you are allowed to choose event3 instead of event1. That yields the infinite sequence: 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 … in which event2 occurs many times but event1 never occurs.
4. This is a valid sequence consistent with the given rules, so C1 is not guaranteed to hold in all cases.
5. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible sequence).

From the rules:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen (repeated).

A valid infinite trace is: 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, ... — after each 2 we choose 3, and after each 3 we are forced to 2. In this trace event2 occurs (many times) but event1 never occurs. Thus C1 is not true in all possible executions, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""event1 or event3 happens"" (holds in a given state).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial one).

Step 2 — apply the conditions to the initial state:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, the rules say the next state must be either event1 or event2.

Step 3 — check C1 in the next state:
- If the next state is event1, then C1 is true there (event1 ∨ event3 holds).
- If the next state is event2, then C1 is false there (neither event1 nor event3 holds in that state).

Because the rules allow the next state to be event2, there is a possible next state where C1 does not hold. Therefore C2 (that C1 holds in the next state) is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initial state s0: event3 holds.
- From event3 the rule requires the next state s1 to have either event1 or event2.
- If s1 has event1, then C1 (event1 or event3) holds in s1, so C2 would be true on that branch.
- But if s1 has event2, then s1 does not have event1 or event3, so C1 fails in s1 and C2 is false on that branch.
- Because the transition allows s1 = event2, C2 is not guaranteed; therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens"" (i.e., Event1 ∨ Event3).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions / transitions:
- Initially Event3 happened.
- After Event3, the next event must be either Event1 or Event2 (no direct Event3).
- After Event1, next must be Event2 or Event3.
- After Event2, next must be Event3.

Step 3 — Trace possible next states from the initial state:
- Starting at Event3, the next state can be Event1 or Event2 (both allowed).
  - If the next state is Event1, then C1 (Event1 ∨ Event3) is true there.
  - If the next state is Event2, then neither Event1 nor Event3 holds, so C1 is false there.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
- Because there is a possible next state (Event2) where C1 is false, C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state.
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed; C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: event1 happens or event3 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen — C1 is therefore true (since event1 happens).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Because event1 already happened initially, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.
- The other rules (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event2 → event3) do not force event2 to have happened before the initial event1, and there is no information allowing event2 to occur after event1.

Step 3 — conclude about event2 and C2
- Event2 cannot occur (it cannot happen after the initial event1, and nothing allows it to have happened before the initial state).
- C2 requires event2 to happen in addition to C1. Since event2 does not happen, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (event2 happens). So C2 is true exactly when (event2 happens) and either event1 or event3 happens.

Step 2 — Use the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore once the initial event1 has occurred, no event2 or event3 can occur later.
- The other rules (""After event3 ..."", ""After event2 ..."") are irrelevant because event3 and event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because event1 happens (so event1 OR event3 is true).
- Event2 does not happen (it is ruled out by the rule that no events can happen after event1), so C2 = C1 AND event2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context: initially event1 happens.
2. Rule: after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore, once that initial event1 has occurred, no event2 or event3 can occur afterward.
3. C1 (""event1 or event3 happens"") is true because event1 does happen initially.
4. C2 requires both C1 and that event2 happens. But event2 cannot happen (it would be a ""other event"" after event1, which is forbidden).

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Identify the statements:
  - C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
  - C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (This is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens"" because ""event1 happens"" is a special case of ""event1 eventually happens"".)

- Examine the conditions:
  - Initially event2 occurs.
  - After any event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
  - After event1, event3 must follow.
  - After event3, event2 must follow.

- Construct a valid trace that satisfies all conditions but never has event1:
  - Start with event2, choose event3 after it (allowed).
  - After event3, event2 must occur.
  - After that event2, again choose event3, and so on.
  - This yields the infinite trace 2,3,2,3,2,3,... which satisfies all rules but never contains event1.

- Since there exists a permitted execution with no event1, C1 is false. Therefore C2 (equivalent to C1) is also false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We are asked about C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""
- C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

So C2 is the disjunction: (event1 eventually happens) OR (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (non‑deterministic choice).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- From the initial event2, one possible choice is to take event3. Then by the rules we must do event2 next, and again from event2 we may choose event3, and so on.
- That yields the infinite trace: event2, event3, event2, event3, ...
- In this trace event1 never occurs, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is false, and ""event1 happens"" is also false.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because there exists a valid trace (the one above) where neither C1 nor ""event1 happens"" holds, C2 is not guaranteed true.
Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is guaranteed true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context/rules
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- From event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- From event1, the next event must be event3.
- From event3, the next event must be event2.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One possible execution: 2 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 3 → ... (event1 occurs repeatedly). In this run C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true.
- Another possible execution: 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → ... (always choose the branch 3 after 2). In this run event1 never occurs, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Because there exists a valid run in which event1 never occurs, C1 is not guaranteed. Therefore the disjunction ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" is not guaranteed either.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 happens or Event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and Event1 happens (so C2 is equivalent to “Event1 happens”, since C1 is implied once either event has happened).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event2 has happened.
- After Event2, either Event1 or Event3 must happen.
- After Event3, Event1 must happen.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences starting from the initial Event2:
- If after the initial Event2 we get Event1, then Event1 happens.
- If after the initial Event2 we get Event3, then by the rule after Event3, Event1 must happen next.
In both branches, Event1 inevitably occurs (and once Event1 occurs it forces Event2, and the rules repeat, but Event1 has already occurred).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 is true because Event2 already occurred initially (and Event1 also ends up occurring).
- Event1 does occur as shown above, so C2 (C1 holds and Event1 happens) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 happens) OR (event2 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (event1 happens). That is logically equivalent to (event1 happens).

So the question reduces to: does event1 happen?

Step 2 — examine the conditions / rules:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- (Also: after event1, event2 must happen, but that doesn't prevent event1 from occurring.)

Step 3 — trace possibilities from the initial event2:
- From the initial event2, either event1 occurs next (so event1 happens), or event3 occurs next.
- If event3 occurs next, then by the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur afterward.

In every possible case starting from the initial event2, event1 occurs. Therefore C2 (which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"") is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when (C1 is true) AND (event1 happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 has happened. So C1 is already true (because event2 happened).
- Rules:
  - After event1 → event2 must happen.
  - After event2 → either event1 or event3 must happen.
  - After event3 → event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences starting from the initial event2:
- From the initial event2, either:
  - event1 happens next → then event1 has happened (satisfying the ""event1 happens"" part).
  - or event3 happens next → but after event3, event1 must happen, so event1 still happens (possibly after event3).
In every allowed continuation from the initial event2, event1 occurs (directly or via event3).

Step 4 — conclude:
- C1 is true (because event2 initially happened).
- Event1 necessarily happens in every permitted sequence starting from that initial event2.
Therefore C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens) is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what C2 says:
- C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens,"" i.e. (event3 does not happen) → (event3 happens).

Step 2 — use the context to decide whether event3 can happen:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur after that.
- Therefore event3 cannot occur at any time. So C1 (event3 does not happen) is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 given C1:
- C2 is an implication with a true antecedent (C1) but a false consequent (event3 does not happen, so event3 is false). An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Conclusion: C2 is False.

False

Identify the question
- You ask whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"") is True or False.

Interpret the statements
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""If event3 does not happen, then event3 happens."" (substituting C1)

Use the given context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no further events can occur, so event3 does not happen. Thus C1 is true under the given context.

Evaluate C2
- C2 is an implication with true antecedent (C1) and false consequent (event3 happens). An implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Conclusion
- False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 is the claim: ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens."" Written as (C1 → event3).
- C1 is ""event3 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the context and consequences
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Because event1 has already happened initially, no further events (including event2 or event3) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event3 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- The context also makes event2 impossible, and the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event3 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts: if C1 (true) then event3 happens. That is, a true antecedent and a false consequent (event3 does not happen) — an implication with true antecedent and false consequent is false.

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" i.e. in every possible sequence/event trace, Event1 never happens.
So we must decide whether Event1 never happens in all allowed traces.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences starting from the initial event2
- If after event2 we choose event1, then Event1 happens.
- If after event2 we choose event3, then by the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"", Event1 happens next.
So in every possible continuation from the initial event2, Event1 occurs.

Conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in all traces.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 asserts that C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") always holds (i.e., event1 never happens).

Use the premises:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (but that does not forbid event1 itself).

Trace possibilities from the initial event2:
- If after event2 we have event1, then event1 happens.
- If after event2 we have event3, then by the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen,"" event1 will happen afterward.

In every allowed continuation from the initial state, event1 occurs. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
First: what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (a statement about the events in a run)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every possible run, Event1 does not happen)
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Examine the conditions
1. Initially, event2 happened. So we start with E2 having occurred.
2. After event3 (E3), event1 (E1) must happen. So any occurrence of E3 forces a later E1.
3. After event1, no other events can happen. E1 is terminal.
4. After event2 (E2), either event1 (E1) or event3 (E3) must happen. So starting from the initial E2, the next required occurrence is either E1 or E3.

Trace the possible sequences from the initial state
- From the initial E2, one option is that E1 happens next. Then E1 has occurred (so C1 is false for that run), and no further events can occur.
- The other option is that E3 happens next. But if E3 happens, rule 2 requires that E1 must happen afterward. So in that branch E1 also occurs (and then terminates the run).

In every possible branch starting from the initial E2, E1 occurs (either immediately or after E3). Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in every run; hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time 1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at time 1 it is true that event3 will happen in the next state — equivalently, event3 happens at time 2).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially (time 0): event3 happened.
- After event3 occurs, event2 must happen next. So at time 1: event2 (forced).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next (time 2).
- After event1, event3 must happen next (but that only applies if event1 occurs).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Since time 0 is event3, time 1 must be event2. Therefore C1 (event3 at time 1) is false.
- C2 asserts event3 at time 2. From time 1 being event2, time 2 may be either event1 or event3; event3 at time 2 is possible but not forced.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed by the conditions (it is not true in all possible futures), so C2 is False. 

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time 1 from the current state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — meaning: at time 1, C1 is true; equivalently, event3 happens at time 2.

Step 2 — Apply the rules from the context, starting from the initial state (time 0)
- Initially (time 0): event3 happened.
- Rule: after event3, event2 must happen ⇒ at time 1: event2.
- Rule: after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen ⇒ at time 2: either event1 or event3 (both are possible).

Step 3 — Evaluate C2
- C2 asserts event3 at time 2. But from the rules time 2 can be event1 or event3. Since event1 at time 2 is a permitted possibility, event3 at time 2 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. By ""After event3, event2 must happen,"" the next state (call it state1) must have event2. 
- C1 asserts ""Event3 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in state1). That is false because state1 has event2.
- C2 asserts ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in state1, C1 is true (so state2 would have event3). From state1 (where event2 occurred), the rule says the next state must be either event1 or event3. That means C1 (event3 in the following state) is possible but not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is not entailed (not necessarily true) in the initial state. Hence C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., in every state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, it is true that event1 always happens).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — use the given rules to build the execution
- Initially (state S0) event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen → so S1 has event1.
- After event1, event3 must happen → so S2 has event3.
- This enforces an alternating sequence: S0: event3, S1: event1, S2: event3, S3: event1, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false at S0 because S0 has event3 (not event1). There exist states (S0, S2, ...) where event1 does not occur, so event1 is not true in every state.
- C2 asks whether C1 holds in the next state (S1). From S1 onward the alternation continues (S1: event1, S2: event3, ...), so there are future states (e.g. S2) where event1 does not happen. Thus C1 is also false when evaluated at S1, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., at every state/time).
- From the context: t0: event3 (given). After event3 ⇒ event1, so t1: event1. After event1 ⇒ event3, so t2: event3. After event3 ⇒ event1, so t3: event1. The system alternates: 3,1,3,1,...
- Event1 therefore occurs only at every other state, not at every state, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., from t1 onward event1 always holds). But starting at t1 the pattern continues 1,3,1,3,... so event1 is not true at every state from t1 onward. Therefore C2 is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""

Given rules:
- Initially (state0): event3.
- After event3 → event1 in the next state.
- After event1 → event3 in the next state.
(After event2 → event3 is irrelevant because event2 never occurs here.)

Trace:
- state0: event3
- state1: event1 (by rule after event3)
- state2: event3 (by rule after event1)
- state3: event1, etc. — they alternate.

C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false (event1 is not true in state0, and it does not hold in every future state — it only holds in every other state). Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state either.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- Hypothesis C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, Event2 happens in that state's next state (so Event2 would occur two steps from now).

From the context:
- Initially event3 happened (current state).
- After event3, event1 must happen → the next state must be event1. So C1 (Event2 in the next state) is false.
- After event1, event3 must happen → the state after that (two steps from now) must be event3, so Event2 cannot occur there. Thus C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — at the initial state this means event2 occurs in state1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at the initial state this means that in state1, C1 is true, i.e. event2 occurs in state2.

Step 2 — apply the conditions from the context starting from the initial state (state0):
- Initially (state0) event3 happened.
- ""After event3, event1 must happen"" ⇒ state1 must have event1.
- ""After event1, event3 must happen"" ⇒ state2 must have event3.
Thus the sequence is forced: state0: event3, state1: event1, state2: event3, … (alternating 3 and 1).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 at state0 asks whether event2 occurs in state1. But state1 is forced to be event1, so C1 is false at state0.
- C2 at state0 asks whether C1 holds at state1 — i.e. whether event2 occurs in state2. But state2 is forced to be event3, so C2 is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e., event2 occurs at time t+1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., at time t+1 it is true that event2 happens at time t+2) — equivalently, event2 happens at time t+2.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially (time t) event3 happened.
- After event3 must come event1 (so at t+1: event1).
- After event1 must come event3 (so at t+2: event3).
- After event2 must come either event1 or event3 — but this only applies if event2 occurs.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence from the initial state:
- t: event3 (given).
- t+1: must be event1 (by the rule after event3).
- t+2: must be event3 (by the rule after event1).

No rule forces event2 at t+1 or at t+2, and the required events at t+1 and t+2 are event1 and event3 respectively. Therefore:
- C1 (event2 at t+1) is false.
- C2 (event2 at t+2) is also false.

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 did not occur).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Since event3 has just happened, the rule ""after event3, event1 must happen"" forces the next state to have event1.
- Therefore the next state cannot have event3 (it must be event1). Also, after event1 nothing else can happen later.

- ""After event3, event1 must happen"" → at time 1 event1 must occur.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → after time 1 there are no further events.
- ""After event2, event3 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- time 0: event3.
- time 1 (next state): event1 (required).
- event3 does not happen at time 1; it happened at time 0. Event1 prevents any further events.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 is false (event3 does not happen in the next state).
- Therefore C2 (""event1 happens and C1 holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event3 happens in the next state."" So C2 is true only if (a) event1 happens in the next state and (b) event3 also happens in the next state.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened (this is the current/past state).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so the next state must have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- After event2, event3 must happen (irrelevant unless event2 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event3, the next state must be event1.
- Therefore the next state contains event1, not event3.
- Given ""no other events can happen"" after event1, event3 cannot also occur after that point.
- (If one allowed multiple simultaneous events in a state the problem would be ambiguous, but standard reading is one event per state.)

Step 4 — conclude:
- C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false.
- Thus C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false (even though event1 does happen, C1 does not).

C2 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Interpret C1 as the statement “Event1 happens (at some point) and Event3 happens (at some point).” C2 then says that C1 holds in every possible execution (i.e., in all continuations).

- Initially event3 has happened, so the “Event3 happens” part of C1 is already satisfied in every run.

- From event3, the rules say the next event must be either event1 or event2.
  - If the next event is event1, then “Event1 happens” is satisfied immediately.
  - If the next event is event2, the rule “After event2, event1 must happen” forces event1 to happen next.

- Thus in every possible sequence starting from the initial event3, event1 will occur (either immediately or after one step), and event3 already occurred. Therefore C1 holds in every possible execution.

Hence C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution starting from the given initial condition, C1 is true.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event3 has happened (so event3 is already true).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about all possible executions
- Since event3 has happened initially, one of two things must occur next: event1 or event2.
  - If event1 happens next, then both event1 and event3 have occurred — C1 holds.
  - If event2 happens next, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur afterward, so again both event1 and event3 have occurred — C1 holds.
- There is no branch that avoids event1 (because the only alternative after event3 is event2, which in turn forces event1). So in every possible execution starting from the initial state, both event3 (initially) and event1 (immediately or after event2) occur.

Conclusion
- C1 holds in every possible execution, so ""C1 always holds"" is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are given temporal rules and asked whether ""C2: (Event2 does not happen) holds in the next state"" is true.

Step-by-step:

- Initially event3 happened (call that state S0).
- Rule after event3: in the next state (S1) either event1 or event2 must happen.
- C2 says: in S1, event2 does not happen (so S1 must not contain event2).

Can we conclude C2 from the rules? No — the rule after event3 permits two possibilities for S1: event1 or event2. If S1 is event1 then C2 is true; if S1 is event2 then C2 is false. The constraints do not force one choice over the other, so C2 is not guaranteed.

Therefore C2 is False (not entailed by the given information).
---
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened.
- The rule ""After event3, either event1, or event2 must happen"" means the next state must contain event1 or event2 (it could be event1, or it could be event2).
- C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen."" C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., event2 does not happen next).
- Because the next state could be event2 (the rules allow either event1 or event2), we cannot guarantee that event2 does not happen. Therefore C2 does not follow from the given conditions.
---
First, restate the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" i.e. in the next state Event2 does not happen.

Examine the premises:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (explicitly given).
- Other rules (after event1 → event2 or event3; after event2 → event3) are irrelevant for the immediate next state.

From ""initially event3 happened"" and ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"", the next state may contain event1 OR may contain event2. Since one allowed possibility for the next state is that event2 happens, C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") need not hold in the next state. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Counterexample: initial = event3; next = event2 (allowed). Then C1 is false in that next state, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in all possible executions, Event3 never happens).
We must determine whether C2 is true or false.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (So whenever event2 has occurred, the next required event is event3.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal.)

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences starting from the initial state:
- Because initially event2 happened, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur next. So event3 does happen in every execution beginning from the initial state.
- After that event3, the execution continues with either event1 (which then terminates) or event2 (which forces another event3 next), but in either case event3 has already occurred at least once.

Step 4 — Conclusion about C1 and C2:
- C1 (Event3 does not happen) is false in the actual (and all possible) executions because event3 is forced immediately after the initial event2.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., in every possible run, Event3 never happens).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event3 is required immediately after any event2).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace sequences from the initial condition:
- The system starts with event2. By the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"", event3 occurs next. Thus event3 does happen.
- Whether after that event1 (then stop) or event2 (then event3 must follow again), event3 still occurs at least once.

Conclusion:
- C1 is violated (event3 does happen), so it cannot always hold. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True or False. C1 asserts ""Event3 does not happen."" C2 asserts that C1 holds in all possible executions (i.e., event3 never happens).

From the context: initially event2 happened. The rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur (at least once) after that initial event2. Therefore C1 is false (event3 does happen), so it cannot ""always hold."" Hence C2 is False.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. By the rules, after event3 event1 must happen, so the next event is event1.
- After event1, the system non-deterministically must do either event2 or event3.
  - If it chooses event2, execution ends (no further events).
  - If it chooses event3, we return to the situation “after event3” and the pattern repeats.
- Therefore there is a valid infinite execution that never takes event2 (repeat event3 → event1 → event3 → ...). So “Event2 always happens” (C1) is false.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state (i.e. after the required event1). Since after event1 event2 is not guaranteed, C1 does not hold at that next state. Thus C2 is false.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the next state, event2 always happens)

Examine the rules and trace possible sequences:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen → sequence starts: event3 → event1.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- If after event1 we choose event3, the rules force event1 next, and again we can choose event3, etc.
- This yields an infinite trace: event3, event1, event3, event1, event3, ... in which event2 never occurs. All constraints are satisfied on this trace.

Because there exists a valid trace where event2 never occurs, C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:
- C1 says ""Event2 always happens."" That would require that in every possible future from the current point, Event2 must occur.
- From the rules: initial event3 → event1 must happen → after event1 either event2 or event3 happens → if event3 happens we repeat the same obligation.
- There is a valid execution that never produces event2: event3, event1, event3, event1, event3, ... (always choose the event3 branch). In that execution Event2 never happens, so C1 is false.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. from the state after the next transition). After the initial event3 the next transition must be event1; from that state the same loop (event3 → event1 → ...) is still possible, so C1 does not hold there either.

Therefore C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is “Event2 happens” (the duplicate phrasing “and event2 happens” is redundant).
- C2 says “C1 eventually holds”, i.e. eventually event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event3 has already happened initially and after event3 no other events can happen, no further events can occur at any later time.
- That prevents event1 or event2 from occurring later.
- The rule “after event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.
- There is no statement that event2 happened initially, so we cannot conclude event2 occurred before the initial state.

Conclusion:
- Event2 does not occur at any time, so C1 is false and therefore C2 (“event2 eventually happens”) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""Eventually event2 happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So the trace ends at event3; no event1 or event2 can occur after the initial event.)
- The other two rules (""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen"") are irrelevant because neither event1 nor event2 can occur given the rule after event3.

Step 3 — trace of events:
- The only event that actually happens is event3 at the start.
- No further events (including event2) can ever occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Event2 never happens, so C1 never becomes true, and C2 (""eventually event2 happens"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is the proposition ""event2 happens"" (the conjunction ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to one occurrence of event2).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. ""event2 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So once event3 has occurred, no further events are possible.)
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event3 happened initially, we are already in a state where ""after event3"" applies. That rule forbids any further events ever occurring.
- Therefore event2 cannot happen later.
- Event1 could force event2, but event1 never occurred (and cannot occur after event3), so that rule does not produce event2 either.

Conclusion:
- Event2 never happens, so C1 never holds and C2 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Start: event2 happened.
- From event2 the rules allow either event1 or event3 next. From event3 the rules allow either event1 or event2 next.
- Consider the valid infinite trace: event2, event3, event2, event3, ... (after each event2 choose event3, after each event3 choose event2). This trace obeys all rules.
- In that trace:
  - Event1 never occurs, so the disjunct ""event1 happens"" can be false.
  - Event3 does not ""always"" happen (there are steps with event2), so C1 is false.
- Therefore the disjunction C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") can be false. Hence C2 is not guaranteed — answer: False.
---
Short summary of reasoning (concise):

- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, one may choose event3.
- After event3, one may choose event2.
- Repeating those choices gives the infinite trace: event2, event3, event2, event3, ...
- In that trace event1 never occurs, and event3 does not hold at every moment (event2 occurs at every other step), so C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false and event1 never happens. Hence C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is not guaranteed.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
C2 asserts that ""C1 always holds."" C1 is ""Event2 happens in the next state."" We must decide whether C1 is true in every state given the rules.

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen (so the next state after the initial one must have event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen (so after the first 3→1, we get a 3↔1 cycle).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
Starting from the initial state (where event2 just happened), the next state must be event3 (by the rule after event2). So C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false in the initial state. After that, the system cycles between event3 and event1 and never requires event2 again.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Since C1 is already false in the initial state, it does not hold always. Therefore C2 is False.

False
---
We want to decide whether C2 (""C1 always holds"") is true given the context.

1) What the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. in every state, the next state has event2.

2) Conditions from the context
- Initially, event2 happened (call that state s0).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so the next state s1 has event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen (s2 has event1).
- After event1, event3 must happen (s3 has event3), and then s4 has event1, etc.

3) Trace
- At s0: event2 occurred. The next state s1 must be event3, not event2 → C1 is false at s0.
- From s1 onward, states alternate event3, event1, event3, event1, ... — event2 does not occur again in any next state.

4) Conclusion
- Because C1 is already false at the initial state s0, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, Event2 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — use the context rules:
- Initially Event2 happened (call that state s0).
- After Event2, Event3 must happen (so in s1 Event3 must hold).
- After Event3, Event1 must happen (so s2 Event1).
- After Event1, Event3 must happen (so s3 Event3), and so on.

Step 3 — examine C1 at the initial state:
- From s0 (where Event2 occurred) the next state s1 must have Event3. There is no requirement that Event2 also occurs in s1. Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is not guaranteed and can be false at s0.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- Since C1 can fail (it already fails at the initial step), it is not true that C1 always holds. Thus C2 is false.

Step 2 — examine the facts:
- Initially, event2 happened. So Event2 does happen (true).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 has already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- The rule about event3 → event1 is irrelevant because event3 cannot occur (it would be after event2).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:

- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur before event2).
- After event3, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event3 is not said to occur).

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s):

- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true only if (a) event2 happens and (b) event1 always happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. So there is at least one allowed history where event2 occurs at the start.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has happened, no further events can occur thereafter.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (event1 would also be terminal if it occurs).
- ""After event3, event1 must happen."" (irrelevant unless event3 occurs).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- Because event2 happens initially and nothing can occur after event2, any history that starts with event2 will have no event1 occurring afterward. The only way for event1 to occur in such a history would be if it had occurred before that initial moment, but the context only guarantees event2 happened initially and gives no guarantee that event1 happened at all.
- Therefore there exists a fully valid history consistent with the context in which event2 happens and event1 never happens (simply: the initial event2 occurs and then nothing else happens). That history satisfies all given constraints (no violation of the ""after"" rules, and the ""after event3"" rule is vacuously satisfied because event3 didn't occur).

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Because there is a valid model where event2 happens but event1 does not, C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is not guaranteed by the context. Hence C2 (which requires both event2 happens and C1 holds) is not entailed.

False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Hypothesis: C2 says ""eventually C1 holds"", where C1 = ""Event2 happens and Event1 happens.""

2. From the context:
   - Initially Event1 has happened (so Event1 is true now).
   - After Event1, Event3 must happen.
   - After Event3, Event1 must happen.
   These two rules force Event1 and Event3 to alternate (Event1 → Event3 → Event1 → ...).
   - The rule ""After Event2, Event3 must happen"" only applies if Event2 actually occurs.

3. Nothing in the context forces Event2 to ever occur. The mandatory obligations only create the Event1↔Event3 loop; Event2 can be absent forever.

4. Since Event2 is not guaranteed, C1 (""Event2 happens and Event1 happens"") is not guaranteed to ever hold. Therefore C2 (""eventually C1"") is not entailed.

Conclusion: C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (i.e. both events occur at some point)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e. eventually both event2 and event1 have occurred)
We must decide whether C2 is guaranteed (True) given the context constraints.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is already true at the start.
- After event1, event3 must happen (so sometime after any event1, an event3 occurs).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so event3 forces a later event1).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs then later event3 must occur).

Step 3 — reason about possible event sequences
- From the initial event1, the rules force event3 sometime later, and that event3 forces event1 again, and so on: event1 and event3 will occur repeatedly (an infinite alternation is possible). Thus event1 is already true and will continue to occur.
- There is no rule that requires event2 to ever occur. The context does not force event2; it only constrains what must follow if event2 does occur.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C1 requires event2 to happen (event1 already holds initially). Because event2 is not forced by the constraints, there are valid behaviors where event2 never occurs; in such behaviors C1 never holds, so C2 is not guaranteed.
Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (a conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point the conjunction in C1 is true.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at time 0).
- After event1, event3 must happen (every time event1 occurs, event3 will occur later).
- After event3, event1 must happen (every time event3 occurs, event1 will occur later).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, event3 will later occur).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- From the initial event1 and the mutual requirements between event1 and event3, we get an infinite alternation: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → … So event1 and event3 keep recurring forever.
- Event2 is not required or forced by any condition; it may or may not ever occur.
- If event2 does occur at some time, then by the rules event3 will occur afterward and then event1 will follow, so both event2 and event1 will have occurred (possibly at different times) — making C1 true at some (possibly later) moment only if we allow ""happens"" to mean ""has happened so far."" But nothing in the context forces event2 to ever occur.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because event2 is not guaranteed to ever happen, we cannot conclude that ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" will eventually hold. Therefore C2 is not entailed by the given conditions.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis: C2 is the claim ""(C1 holds) OR (event3 happens)"". So C2 is true iff either C1 is true or event3 occurs.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event3, no other events can happen; and after event2, event1 must happen.)

Trace possibilities:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no further events (including event2 or event3) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 does not occur, so ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Also event3 does not occur.

Since both C1 is false and event3 does not happen, the disjunction C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (Event2 always happens) OR (event3 happens).

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — deduce consequences:
- Because initially event1 happened and no events can occur after event1, no further events (including event2 or event3) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) happen, so ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Likewise, event3 does not (and cannot) happen, so the second disjunct is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is (C1) OR (event3). Both disjuncts are false given the context, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (C1) or (event3 happens). C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no event2 or event3 can occur later.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (But that is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" immediately blocks any further events. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time, and event3 cannot happen at any time.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because event2 cannot happen at all.
- ""Event3 happens"" is false because event3 cannot happen after the initial event1.
- The disjunction (C1 or event3) is therefore false.

- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event3 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen. (So given the initial event1, event3 is required to occur at some point.)
- The other rules (after event3 → event2; after event2 → either event1 or event3) do not prevent event3 from occurring; they only specify what must follow once event3 or event2 occur.

Step 3 — Reasoning:
- Since event1 has already happened initially and the rule requires that after event1 event3 must happen, event3 will eventually occur. Therefore C1 is true.

C2 is False.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event3 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:

- After event1, event3 must happen. (So event3 is forced after the initial event1.)
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Trace the sequence:
- Because event1 happened initially and ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" event3 will happen at least once. So C1 is true.
- Once event3 happens, event2 must follow, and after event2 either event1 or event3 occurs. In either choice, event3 is guaranteed to occur again eventually: if event1 occurs, then by the first rule event3 must follow; if event3 occurs directly, it's already happening. Thus event3 will occur (indeed repeatedly).

Step 3 — check each part of C2:
- Does Event1 happen? Yes. From the initial event2 we get event3 (mandatory) and then event1 (mandatory). So Event1 does occur.
- Does Event2 ""always happen""? No. From event1 we are allowed to choose event3 instead of event2; for example the infinite sequence
  event2 → event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ...
  never returns to event2 after the initial occurrence. Thus Event2 is not guaranteed to always occur.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:

- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice allowed).

Step 3 — Trace possible sequences:
- From the start: event2 → event3 → event1.
- After that event1 recurs: if after event1 we pick event2, the cycle is event1 → event2 → event3 → event1; if we pick event3, the cycle is event1 → event3 → event1.
- Thus event1 does indeed occur (in fact repeatedly).

Step 4 — Check ""Event2 always happens"":
- The rules allow choosing event3 after event1 every time, yielding the infinite sequence: event2 (initial), event3, event1, event3, event1, ...
- In that sequence, event2 does not always occur (it only occurred initially).
- Therefore ""Event2 always happens"" is not guaranteed.

Conclusion:
- C1 is not guaranteed, so C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False

We interpret ""Event2 always happens"" as: at every step (in all future moments) event2 occurs. Step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened (given).
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

From these rules a valid execution is: 2 (initial) → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... — i.e., after the initial event2 you can always choose event3 after each event1 and never do event2 again. So event2 is not guaranteed to occur at every future step, hence C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.

Event1 does occur (so the first conjunct of C2 holds), but because C1 is false the conjunction C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false.

- C2 asserts that C1 always holds, i.e. ""Event2 does not happen"" at any time (event2 never occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- The context begins: ""Initially, event2 happened."" That means event2 does occur (at the initial time).
- Other rules (after event2 → event3, after event3 → event2, after event1 → event2 or event3) only add constraints for future events but cannot undo the fact that event2 already happened initially.

Step 3 — conclusion
- Since event2 does happen initially, C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- (Also: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen — not needed for the core contradiction.)

Step 3 — trace consequences
- Because event2 happened initially, C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is already false at that initial time.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is immediately falsified.
- Moreover, the rules force alternation: event2 → event3 → event2 → …, so event2 will continue to occur, reinforcing that C1 cannot hold now or always.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen"" together mean that once the initial event2 has occurred, no further events (event1 or event3) can occur afterward. Since event2 is the initial/earliest event, there is no time before it for other events to have happened.
- C1 is ""event1 happens and event3 happens."" Given the context, neither event1 nor event3 can occur (they cannot happen after the initial event2, and they cannot have happened earlier), so C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" That simplifies to just ""event1 happens"" (because C1 implies event1). Since event1 cannot happen under the given constraints, C2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C2 is ""(Event1 and Event3) OR Event1"". We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the hypothesis
(A and B) OR A is equivalent to A, so C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""

Step 3 — use the context to see if Event1 happens
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 happens initially, nothing else (including event1) can happen after that.
- Therefore Event1 does not happen (and likewise Event3 does not happen).

Step 4 — conclusion
Since Event1 does not happen, C2 (which is equivalent to Event1) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = (event1 happens) AND (event3 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens). Logically, C2 ≡ (event1 happens). (Because A ∨ (A ∧ B) = A.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. => event2 is terminal; no further events occur.
- The other rules (what must follow after event1 or event3) are irrelevant if event1/event3 never occur.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Since event2 happened initially and nothing can happen after it, event1 does not occur (there is no place in the timeline for it).
- Therefore event1 is false, and so C1 (which requires event1 and event3) is false.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C2 ≡ event1, and event1 does not happen under the given conditions. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = ""In every possible execution, Event3 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible executions:
- Since event1 has happened and after it either event2 or event3 must occur, there are two possible continuations: one where event2 happens, and one where event3 happens.
- In the continuation where event3 is chosen, event3 does happen. Thus C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false in that execution.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2:
- Because there exists a possible execution where event3 happens, C1 does not hold in all executions. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""event3 does not happen"" is true in every possible scenario allowed by the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (one of them must occur next).
- After event2, no further events can happen.
- After event3, no further events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Sequence A: event1 → event2 (then stop). In this sequence event3 does not happen, so C1 holds.
- Sequence B: event1 → event3 (then stop). In this sequence event3 does happen, so C1 does not hold.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Because the context allows a sequence where event3 does happen (Sequence B), C1 is not guaranteed to always hold.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 claims that C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") always holds (i.e., in every possible sequence consistent with the context).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2 no other events can happen.
- After event3 no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- From the initial event1, the rules require that either event2 or event3 occurs next.
- Both event1→event2 and event1→event3 are allowed sequences (each is terminal thereafter).

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- There is at least one allowed sequence (event1 → event3) in which event3 does happen, so C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is not true in all possible sequences.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what's asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.
- C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur (derived from the initial event3).
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur afterward.
- After event1, event3 must happen — this only imposes a requirement if event1 occurs; it does not force event1 to occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event3 already happened initially, event2 must happen (so event2 does happen).
- Once event2 happens, no further events can occur. Therefore event1 cannot occur after that.
- Nothing in the context requires event1 to occur at any time before the initial event3; the context does not entail that event1 happens at all.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 does happen, but C1 (that event1 eventually happens) is not guaranteed by the context.
- Therefore the conjunction C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is not entailed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 happens and C1 holds (i.e., Event2 happens AND Event1 eventually happens).

Step 2 — understand the context rules:
- Initially, event3 has happened.
- If event1 happens, then afterwards event3 must happen.
- If event3 happens, then afterwards event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- From the initial event3, rule “after event3, event2 must happen” forces event2 to occur at some future point.
- That does not forbid other events occurring before that mandatory event2; so two kinds of allowed sequences exist:
  - Minimal sequence: 3 (initial) → 2 → terminal (no event1 ever occurs).
  - Longer sequence: 3 → 1 → 3 → 2 → terminal (event1 can occur between the initial 3 and the eventual 2, triggering another 3 then the required 2).
- Therefore event2 is guaranteed to happen, but event1 is not guaranteed — it may or may not occur before the mandatory event2.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 requires both that event2 happens (true) AND that event1 eventually happens (not guaranteed).
- Because event1 need not occur in all allowed sequences, the conjunction in C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"", i.e. both (a) Event2 occurs and (b) Event1 eventually occurs.

Step 2 — what the context requires
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After any event3, event2 must eventually happen.
- After event1, event3 must eventually happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about possible traces
- From the initial event3, the context forces event2 to occur eventually. So event2 is guaranteed.
- Nothing in the context requires event1 to ever occur. Event1 could occur between event3 and event2 (in which case additional event3 and then event2 would follow), but it need not.

Counterexample trace that satisfies all context constraints but falsifies C2:
- Trace: event3 (initial) → event2 → end.
  - This satisfies ""after event3, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, no other events"".
  - Event1 never occurs, so C1 is false and therefore C2 is false in this trace.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid trace consistent with the context where event1 does not occur, C2 is not guaranteed (not entailed).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
- C1 is: ""Event3 does not happen.""
So C2 says both (a) Event1 happens, and (b) Event3 does not happen.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 has occurred.)
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- The context explicitly states event3 did happen initially. That directly contradicts C1 (""Event3 does not happen""), so C1 is false.
- Because C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 cannot be true regardless of whether event1 happens or not.
- (Independent check: if event1 did happen immediately after the initial event3, that would be allowed by the rules, but it would not make C1 true — event3 still occurred.)

Final answer:
False
---
You are asking whether C2 (""Event1 happens and Event3 does not happen"") is true given the scenario.

Reasoning step‑by‑step:
- The context states: ""Initially, event3 happened."" So event3 does occur (at least initially).
- C1 asserts ""Event3 does not happen."" That directly contradicts the fact that event3 happened initially, so C1 is false.
- C2 asserts both ""Event1 happens"" and C1 (i.e., event3 does not happen). Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true (a conjunction with a false conjunct is false).
- Also, from the rules: after the initial event3 either event1 or event2 must happen; in either case event3 still happens (initially, and if event2 occurs then event3 happens again). So ""event3 does not happen"" is impossible under the given constraints.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- The hypothesis C2 is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""
- The context states that initially event3 happened. That already contradicts C1, so C1 is false.
- Even though after that either event1 or event2 must happen (and one possible run is event3 → event1), C2 requires both event1 to happen and C1 to be true. Since C1 is false (because event3 did happen initially), C2 cannot be true.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happens (so at time 0, event2 is true).
- The statement ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means at the next moment (and thereafter) there are no events occurring. In particular, at the next moment event2 is not occurring.
- C1 is the proposition ""event2 does not happen."" That is true at the next moment after the initial event2.
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there is some future moment where event2 does not happen). As just shown, such a moment exists immediately after the initial event2.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
We interpret C1 as the proposition ""event2 does not happen (in the current state)"", and C2 as ""eventually C1 holds"" (there is some future state where event2 does not happen).

Step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 is false at the initial moment.
- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. That means at the next state (and all subsequent states) no events occur — in particular, event2 does not occur in those states.
- Therefore there is a future state (immediately after the initial one) where C1 is true.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e. at a given time point, event2 is not occurring).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future time point at which C1 is true (i.e. at some future point event2 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (time 0).
- After event2, no other events can happen. So from the next time point onward, no events occur.
- The rules about event1/event3 are irrelevant because they cannot fire after event2 (no further events allowed).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Time 0: event2 happens.
- Time 1 (and all later times): no events happen. In particular, at time 1 event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — conclusion
- There is a future time (time 1) where event2 does not happen, so C1 holds there. Therefore C2 is true.

We are asked whether C2 (""Event3 happens and Event1 does not happen"") is true given the rules.

1. The hypothesis: C2 = (Event3 happens) AND (Event1 does not happen).
2. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" That means Event1 did happen (at least at the initial time).
3. Therefore the statement ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
4. Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 cannot be true, regardless of whether Event3 happens later.

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C2 is true. C1 says ""Event2 does not happen."" C2 says ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., ""Event2 does happen.""

Examine the rules:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

Starting from event3, one valid continuation is to choose event1 (allowed by the second rule). After that, choose event3 (allowed by the third rule). After that choose event1 again, then event3, and so on. This yields the infinite sequence: event3, event1, event3, event1, ... which never includes event2 and respects all given rules.

Because a rule-consistent sequence exists in which event2 never occurs, C1 can hold, so C2 (""event2 does happen"") is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. C2 asserts that Event2 does happen.

Step 2 — examine conditions (transitions):
- Start: event3 happened.
- After event3: next must be event1 or event2.
- After event1: next must be event2 or event3.
- After event2: next must be event1.

Step 3 — try to satisfy C1 (i.e., avoid event2):
- From the initial event3, choose event1 (allowed).
- From event1, choose event3 (allowed).
- Repeat: 3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → ... This infinite alternation satisfies all rules and never uses event2.

Conclusion:
- There exists a valid sequence where Event2 does not happen, so C1 can hold.
- Therefore C2 (""Event2 happens"") is not necessarily true.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. C2 asserts that Event2 does happen (negation of C1).

Step 2 — examine conditions
- Initially event3 occurs.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must occur.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must occur.
- After event2, event1 must occur.

Step 3 — find a sequence compatible with the conditions that makes C1 true
- Start: 3.
- After 3 choose 1 (allowed).
- After 1 choose 3 (allowed).
- Repeat 1 and 3 forever: 3,1,3,1,...
This infinite alternation respects all given constraints and never contains event2, so Event2 does not happen (C1 holds) is possible.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- Because there exists a valid sequence where Event2 never occurs, C1 is not ruled out by the conditions.
- Therefore C2 (the claim that Event2 happens) is not necessarily true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypotheses:
- C1 = (Event1 happens) AND (Event3 happens).
- C2 = (Event3 happens) OR C1. This simplifies to just (Event3 happens) because (A ∧ B) ∨ B = B.

Step 2 — examine the conditions / possible sequences:
- Initially Event1 happens.
- After Event1, Event2 must happen.
- After Event2, either Event1 or Event3 must happen.
- After Event3, no further events can occur.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- One possible finite sequence: 1 → 2 → 3 (Event3 happens).
- Another possible sequence: 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 3 (Event3 happens later).
- But it is also allowed to always choose Event1 after Event2, yielding 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ... forever, in which Event3 never happens.

Conclusion:
Since Event3 is not guaranteed (there is a valid infinite sequence without Event3), C2 (which is equivalent to ""Event3 happens"") is not necessarily true. Therefore the correct answer is:

False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"".
- C1 is ""Event1 happens and Event3 happens"".
- So C2 is (Event3) OR (Event1 AND Event3). Since (Event1 AND Event3) implies Event3, C2 is logically equivalent to just ""Event3 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event1 happens (so Event1 is true).
- After Event1, Event2 must happen (so Event2 must occur next).
- After Event2, either Event1 or Event3 must happen (a choice).
- After Event3, no other events can happen (Event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- One possible sequence: Event1 → Event2 → Event3. That makes Event3 true (so C2 true in that run).
- But after Event2 we could instead choose Event1 and loop: Event1 → Event2 → Event1 → Event2 → ... indefinitely, never taking the Event3 branch. Nothing forces that Event3 must eventually occur.

Conclusion:
- Event3 is not guaranteed by the rules (it may or may not happen). Since C2 is equivalent to ""Event3 happens"", C2 is not guaranteed/entailed.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C2 is the statement: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds.""
- C1 is: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens.""
- So C2 is equivalent to ""Event3 happens"" (since (E3) or (E1 and E3) is just E3).

Step 2 — examine the given rules
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One allowed sequence: event1 → event2 → event3 (then stop). This makes C2 true.
- But another allowed sequence is infinite repetition: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... never reaching event3. This sequence respects all rules (after each event1 there is event2; after each event2 we choose event1), and in it event3 never happens, so C1 is false and event3 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid sequence consistent with the rules where neither event3 nor C1 occurs, C2 is not guaranteed by the premises.

Final answer by majority vote: False

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- We ask whether C2 (""Event1 happens OR C1 holds"") is guaranteed by the given rules and the initial fact that event3 happened.
- The rules allow nondeterministic choices after event3: either event1 or event2 may follow.
- Construct a valid run that starts with the given event3 and always chooses event2 after each event3:
  3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, ...
  This run satisfies all rules: after 3 we pick 2, after 2 we must pick 3, and so on.
- In that run, event1 never happens. Also C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false in the natural reading (event2 does not occur at every step because event3 occurs between every two event2s).
- Therefore both disjuncts of C2 are false in this valid run, so C2 is not guaranteed. Hence C2 is False.
---
We need to decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") must be true given the rules. Here C1 = ""Event2 always happens.""

Start: event3 happened. From the rules we can choose, after each event3, either event1 or event2; after event2 we must have event3. Consider this legal infinite trace:
event3, event2, event3, event2, event3, event2, ...
- Event1 never occurs in this trace.
- Event2 does occur repeatedly, but it does not hold at every time point (the trace contains event3 steps), so ""Event2 always happens"" is false under the usual reading of ""always"" (i.e., at every time point).

Thus there is a valid execution where neither Event1 ever occurs nor C1 holds, so C2 is not guaranteed. Final answer:

False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. What is asked: is C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") necessarily true given the rules?

2. Rules recap:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.

3. Interpret C1 as ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every step/event). The initial occurrence of event3 already shows C1 is not forced (event2 did not happen at that time). So C1 can be false.

4. Construct a valid sequence consistent with the rules that makes C2 false:
   - Always choose event2 after every event3. Starting from the initial 3, the sequence is 3,2,3,2,3,2,... This obeys all rules.
   - In this sequence event1 never occurs, so ""Event1 happens"" is false.
   - Also event2 does not happen at every step (the sequence contains event3 steps), so C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
   - Thus C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is false in this valid run.

Because there exists a valid run where C2 is false, C2 is not guaranteed by the given information. Therefore the correct answer is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asserts: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event3 does not happen."" So C2 is the conjunction: (Event3 happens) AND (Event3 does not happen).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — what the context allows
- From event2 happening, event1 must eventually occur; once event1 occurs nothing further can occur.
- Event3 could occur before that required event1 (e.g., sequence event2 → event3 → event1) and the rules still hold, but event3 is not forced to happen. So C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is not entailed by the context (it may or may not hold).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires both ""Event3 happens"" and ""Event3 does not happen"" simultaneously, which is a direct contradiction. A contradictory conjunction cannot be true in any model.

Final answer:
False
---
First identify the formulas:

- C1: ""Event3 does not happen."" (¬Event3)
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" (Event3 ∧ ¬Event3)

Examine the content:

- C2 is a conjunction demanding both Event3 and ¬Event3 simultaneously.

Logical reasoning / tracing:

- A conjunction of a proposition and its negation is always false (contradiction), regardless of the background event constraints.
- The given event constraints do not make Event3 and ¬Event3 both true at once; at best they allow Event3 to happen or not happen, but cannot satisfy both.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is equivalent to ""Event3 happens AND Event3 does not happen.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — reason about consistency:
- C2 asserts a direct contradiction (Event3 both happens and does not happen). A statement of the form A and not-A cannot be true.
- The context doesn't remove that contradiction: whether event3 occurs before event1 or not, C2 still requires both occurrence and non-occurrence simultaneously.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Hypothesis C2 is ""Event2 happens AND (Event2 happens OR Event3 happens)"". That simplifies to just ""Event2 happens"".
2. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has already occurred at the start.
3. Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Because event1 has already happened initially, no further events (neither event2 nor event3) can occur afterward.
4. Therefore event2 cannot happen. (Event3 cannot happen either.)
5. Since event2 does not happen, C2 is false.
---
Let's go step by step.

1. The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 has already occurred at the start.

2. The context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred (and it already has), no further events can occur at any later time — in particular event2 and event3 cannot occur after that point.

3. Therefore neither event2 nor event3 can happen at any time (given the initial event1 and the ""no other events after event1"" rule).

4. C1 is ""Event2 happens or event3 happens."" Since neither can happen, C1 is false.

5. C2 is ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Because event2 does not happen and C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 = (Event2 happens) OR (Event3 happens).
- C2 = (Event2 happens) AND C1. Logically C2 is equivalent to (Event2 happens) — because Event2 → (Event2 or Event3).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, Event1 happened.
- After Event1, no other events can happen (so no Event2 or Event3 can occur after the initial Event1).
- The other rules (after Event2 → Event1, after Event3 → Event1 or Event2) are irrelevant if Event2/3 cannot occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since Event1 already happened initially and no events can happen afterward, Event2 cannot happen (nor can Event3).
- Therefore C1 is false (neither Event2 nor Event3 happens).
- Consequently C2 is false (Event2 does not happen).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So we must decide whether, given the rules and the initial event, C2 is guaranteed true.

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initial event: event3 has happened.
- From event3 → next must be either event1 or event2.
- From event1 → next must be event2.
- From event2 → next must be either event1 or event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- C1 (""Event3 eventually happens"") is true at the start because event3 has already happened.
- But event1 is not forced to ever occur: after the initial event3 we may choose event2; from event2 we may choose event3; from event3 choose event2; and so on. The infinite sequence 3,2,3,2,... respects all rules and never contains event1.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a permitted execution where event1 never happens (while C1 still holds), C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (so requires event1 to occur, and event3 to occur at some point)

Examine the rules/transitions:
- Initially event3 has happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

We need to know whether C2 must hold given these rules. Provide a counterexample execution that satisfies the rules but violates C2:

Start at the initial event3, then always pick the branch that avoids event1:
- e3 (initial) → e2 (choose e2 after e3)
- e2 → e3 (choose e3 after e2)
- e3 → e2 → e3 → e2 → ... repeating

This infinite trace respects all the ""after"" constraints but never contains event1. C1 holds here because event3 already occurred initially (and also recurs), but event1 never happens. Therefore C2 (""event1 happens and C1 holds"") is not guaranteed.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires both that event1 occurs at some point and that event3 occurs at some point.

We must decide whether C2 is entailed by the given conditions (i.e., must be true in every allowed execution).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened → C1 is already satisfied (event3 has occurred).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (next step).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
From the initial event3, the next event can be chosen as event2. From event2 the next can be chosen as event3. From that event3 again choose event2, and so on:
- Sequence: event3, event2, event3, event2, event3, ...
This sequence obeys all rules:
- After each event3 we do event2 (allowed: event1 or event2).
- After each event2 we do event3 (allowed: event1 or event3).
Event1 never occurs in this execution, while event3 occurs (initially and repeatedly).

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there exists an allowed execution where event1 never happens, C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is not guaranteed by the premises. C1 alone is true, but the conjunct ""Event1 happens"" need not hold.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 = ""Event3 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""Event2 happens and C1 holds.""
The question: given the context, is C2 true?

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, Event3 happened → Event3 is true, so C1 is already true (since Event3 happens).
- After Event3, Event1 must happen → there will be an Event1 following the initial Event3.
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen → this is a choice; it does not force Event2, it allows either.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen → if Event2 occurs, it forces another Event1.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- One possible infinite trace: Event3 → Event1 → Event3 → Event1 → ... (always choose Event3 after Event1). In this trace Event2 never occurs.
- Another possible trace: Event3 → Event1 → Event2 → Event1 → Event2 → ... (always choose Event2 after Event1). In this trace Event2 does occur.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 is true (because Event3 happened initially).
- C2 requires Event2 to happen as well. The context does not force Event2 to occur (it’s optional after Event1), so Event2 is not guaranteed.
- Therefore C2 is not necessarily true (it is satisfiable in some traces but not entailed by the context).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says:
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true only if event2 occurs and at least one of event1/event3 occurs.

Step 2 — examine the rules:
- Initially event3 happened → event3 is true initially.
- After event3, event1 must happen → event1 follows event3.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen → from event1 at least one of event2 or event3 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event2 forces event1 afterward.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
Starting from the initial event3, rule 2 forces event1. After that event1, rule 3 allows either event2 or event3. If we always choose event3, we get the repeating sequence: event3 → event1 → event3 → event1 → ... In this valid sequence no event2 ever occurs, yet C1 holds (because event1 and event3 do happen).

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because there is a valid sequence that satisfies all given conditions where event2 never happens, C2 (which requires event2) is not guaranteed/entailed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: (Event3 happens) OR (Event1 happens).
- C2: (Event2 happens) AND C1.

We are asked whether C2 is true given the context (i.e., whether C2 must hold).

Step 2 — examine the context rules
- Initially Event3 happened. (So Event3 is true at the start.)
- After Event3, Event1 must happen. (So Event1 occurs next.)
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen. (A choice: Event2 may happen, or Event3 may happen.)
- After Event2, Event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: Event3 (true). Then Event1 (must).
- After that Event1, there are two allowed continuations:
  - If Event2 happens, then Event1 must follow, etc. In this branch Event2 does occur, so C2 would hold (since C1 is also true).
  - If Event3 happens again, then Event2 never occurs in this branch; C1 still holds (Event3 is true), but Event2 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Event2 is not forced by the rules; it is optional after Event1. Therefore C2 (which requires Event2 to occur) is not guaranteed to be true.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The hypothesis C1 (""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"") is a tautology and therefore holds.
- C2 asserts ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 reduces to asserting ""Event1 happens.""
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen. That allows two possible continuations: event1 happens, or event3 happens.
- Because event3 could happen instead of event1, event1 is not guaranteed by the given information.
Therefore C2 is not entailed by the context, so the correct answer is False.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event3 happens, then event3 happens. (A → A)
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds.

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Reasoning:
- C1 is a tautology (if event3 happens then event3 happens), so C1 holds.
- From the context, after the initial event2 either event1 or event3 occurs, but the context does not force event1 specifically — event3 could occur instead. Thus event1 is not guaranteed.

Conclusion:
- Because event1 is not guaranteed, the conjunction ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is not true (it may be true in one branch but is not entailed).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens."" (a tautology; always true.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 requires Event1 to occur (and C1, which is always true).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (choice).
- After event1, no further events (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, no further events (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Start: event2.
- Then either:
  a) event1 happens (sequence: event2 → event1). In this branch C1 holds (tautologically) and event1 happens, so C2 would be true in this branch.
  b) event3 happens (sequence: event2 → event3). In this branch C1 holds but event1 does not happen, so C2 is false in this branch.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a permitted sequence (event2 → event3) in which event1 does not occur, C2 is not guaranteed by the context. Therefore C2 is not universally true.

- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., event3 does happen).

Step 2 — Examine the context rules:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules: after event3, event2 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen.)

Step 3 — Reasoning about event sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and the context forbids any other events after event1, no other events (including event3) can occur.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 asserts the negation of C1 (i.e., that event3 does happen), which contradicts the context.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., C1 is false → event3 does happen).

Step 2 — examine the context constraints:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event1 happened initially, there is no time after that at which any other event can occur (the context explicitly forbids any events after event1).
- Therefore event3 cannot occur after event1.
- There is no earlier time for event3 to have occurred, since event1 happened initially.
- Hence event3 does not happen. So C1 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., that event3 does happen). But we just established event3 does not happen, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ⇔ ""Event3 does happen.""

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has happened, no further events (including event3) can occur.
- (For completeness: if event3 happened then event2 must happen, and after event2 no other events can happen.)

Step 3 — trace consequences:
- Because event1 happened initially and forbids any subsequent events, event3 cannot happen.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is true.

Conclusion:
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = (event3 happens) OR (event1 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (event3 happens). So C2 is equivalent to (event3 happens) (because if event3 happens, C1 is automatically true; and C2 requires event3).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs, the sequence ends.
- The other rules (""after event3 ..."" and ""after event2 ..."") only matter if those events can occur, but none can occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event1 happens initially and it prevents any further events, no event3 can ever occur.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 requires event3 to happen. Event3 cannot happen under the given constraints. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when (event1 or event3) is true AND event3 is true — equivalently, C2 is true iff event3 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, no further events can occur at any later time.
- The other rules (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event2 → event1 or event3) only matter if event3 or event2 ever occur, but no events can occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The sequence must start with event1 and, because of the ""after event1, no other events can happen"" rule, must stop there. Event3 does not occur at any time.

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C1 is true (event1 happened initially), but C2 requires event3 to happen as well.
- Event3 never happens under the given constraints, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The premises state that initially event1 happened.
2. The rule ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once that initial event1 occurs, the sequence ends — no event2 or event3 can occur afterwards.
3. Therefore event3 does not occur at any later time.
4. C1 (""event3 or event1 happens"") is true because event1 did happen initially.
5. C2 (""C1 holds and event3 happens"") requires event3 to happen, but event3 does not occur, so C2 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event1 does not eventually happen"").

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences starting from the initial state
- At time 0: event1 has already happened (given).
  - So C1 is already satisfied immediately if “eventually” includes the present moment.
- Even if “eventually” is taken to mean strictly future occurrences, the rules force event1 to occur again:
  - From event1 → event2 must happen next.
  - From event2 → either event1 or event3.
    - If event1 occurs, done.
    - If event3 occurs, then after event3 event1 must happen, so event1 occurs anyway.
- Hence in every possible continuation from the initial state, event1 will occur (now or again).

Conclusion
- C1 is true, therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step-by-step reasoning

- C1 states: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Initially, event1 already happened, so C1 holds at the start.
- Check the rules for future behavior:
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
  - After event3, event1 must happen.
- From these rules: every time event2 occurs it is followed either by event1 immediately, or by event3 which is then followed by event1. So event1 will reoccur within at most two steps after any event2.
- Therefore event1 not only happened initially but will continue to occur (hence ""eventually happens"" is satisfied).

Since C1 is true, C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C2 states ""C1 does not hold"" where C1 is ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- The question asks whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred (hence ""eventually happens"" is satisfied immediately).
- Rules after events:
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
  - After event3, event1 must happen.
- These rules ensure event1 will recur (event1 → event2 → either event1 or event3 → event1 ...), so event1 happens now and in the future.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true (it already happened initially).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens or Event3 happens in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so the current/initial state has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, there can be no events in any subsequent state.
- After event3, event2 must happen (irrelevant here unless event3 occurs).
- After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant unless event1 occurs).

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, the next state cannot contain any events. Therefore:
- C1 (event3 in the next state) is false.
- Event1 cannot happen (in any subsequent state), so the first disjunct of C2 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Both disjuncts of C2 are false, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: event3 happens in the next state.
- C2: event1 happens OR C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened (so the current/initial state has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the next state cannot contain any events).
- The other rules (after event3 → event2; after event1 → event3) only matter if event3 or event1 can occur, but they don't force either to occur now.

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event2 happened initially and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" the next state cannot have event3 or event1 (or any other event).
- Therefore C1 (event3 in the next state) is false, and event1 is also false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 = (event1) OR (C1). Both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true given the context. C1 is ""Event3 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — restate the context rules
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about what can happen after the initial state
- The initial event was event2.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means from that point onward no further events (including event1 or event3) can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 (""Event3 happens in the next state"") is false.
- Also event1 cannot happen (there are no further events), so ""Event1 happens"" is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 is (Event1 happens) OR (C1). Both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether ""event3 does not happen"" holds always.

1. Initial condition: event1 happened.
2. Rule: after event1, event3 must happen. Therefore event3 does happen (after event1).
3. That contradicts C1 (""event3 does not happen""), so C1 is false in the actual sequence.
4. C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 does not happen.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., Event3 never happens in any possible execution).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the sequence from the initial condition:
- Initially event1 occurs.
- By the rule “after event1, event3 must happen,” event3 is required to occur.
- Therefore event3 does happen in the actual execution starting from the initial condition.

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2:
- C1 (“Event3 does not happen”) is false in that execution.
- C2 asserts C1 always holds; since we have a valid execution where C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible execution consistent with the context, event3 never happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event3 is required following the initial event1).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (irrelevant here since event2 is not initial).

Step 3 — trace/reason
- Because event1 has happened initially and ""after event1, event3 must happen,"" event3 does in fact happen in that execution.
- Thus C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false in the actual execution.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false, since C1 does not hold even in the given initial scenario.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the actual (initial) run is just event2; event1 does not happen.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because there exists this run where event1 does not happen.
- C2 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are false in the given scenario, so C2 is false.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds.

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no event1 can occur afterward.
- The other rules (after event1 no other events; after event3 either event1 or event2 must happen) are irrelevant because event1 and event3 do not occur given the initial event2 terminal state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because event1 does not happen (event2 happened and stops all further events).
- ""Event1 happens"" (the first disjunct of C2) is false.
- The second disjunct of C2 is C1, which is false.

Therefore C2 (false OR false) is false.

Final answer: False

False

Reason: Initially event2 occurs and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" prevents any further events, so event1 does not occur. Therefore C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false, and the disjunction C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is also false."

- event2 → event3 (then stop). Here both event2 and event3 have happened, so C1 holds.
- event2 → event1 (then stop). Here event3 does not happen, so C1 does not hold.

Since there is a valid execution (event2 → event1) in which C1 never becomes true, ""C1 eventually holds"" is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False. 

Final answer: False
---
First, what the hypothesis asks:
- C1 is the proposition ""event3 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., both events occur).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — read as: does the system guarantee that at some future point C1 will be true?

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true already).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (a choice).
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Trace possible event sequences starting from the initial event2:
- Sequence A: event2 → event1. Then event3 cannot happen (no further events), so C1 (which requires event3) does not hold.
- Sequence B: event2 → event3. Then both event2 and event3 have happened, so C1 holds.

Because the specification allows either sequence A or B, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold in every possible execution (it only holds in the executions that choose event3). C2 asserts that C1 eventually holds (i.e., guaranteed), which is not true under the given conditions.

Sample responses:
First, identify the hypothesis parts:
- C1: Event3 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.

Examine the context rules:
- Initially, event3 happened. So C1 is true (event3 does eventually happen — in fact it has already happened).
- After event3, event2 must happen. That rule obliges event2 to occur following any occurrence of event3.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (Creates a cycle 3 → 2 → 3 … but does not prevent event2 from occurring.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 hasn’t been used.)

Trace the sequence:
- Since event3 happened initially, the rule “after event3, event2 must happen” requires that event2 will happen (after that initial event3).
- Therefore, given that C1 holds, event2 indeed happens.

Conclusion: C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened (so C1 is true already).
- After event3, event2 must happen. (i.e., any occurrence of event3 requires a later event2)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (so they alternate thereafter)
- After event1, event3 must happen (irrelevant here).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event3 has occurred initially, the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur at some later point.
- Thus whenever C1 is true (event3 occurs), the context requires event2 to happen afterward.

Conclusion:
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is entailed by the given conditions.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event3 eventually happens.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. So C1 is satisfied (event3 does happen).
- Rule: After event3, event2 must happen. That means whenever event3 occurs, an event2 must occur later.
- Rule: After event2, event3 must happen. (This creates a required alternation but does not prevent event2.)
- Rule: After event1, event3 must happen. (Irrelevant here.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event3 happened initially, the rule “after event3, event2 must happen” forces event2 to occur.
- Once event2 occurs, the rule “after event2, event3 must happen” forces another event3, which in turn forces another event2, and so on.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- Since C1 is satisfied and the rules force event2 after any event3, C2 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 happens and event3 happens"" — this just asserts that event3 happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — so C2 requires event3 to happen and event1 to happen.

Step 2 — Understand the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has happened, no further events occur.)
- The other rules (""After event1, event3 must happen"" and ""After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"") only matter if event1 or event3 occurs, but they cannot override the ""no other events"" constraint after event2.

Step 3 — Reason about possible events:
- Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event3 cannot occur at any time after the initial state.
- Therefore C1 (event3 happens) is false.
- Because C2 requires C1 to hold (plus event1), C2 cannot be true.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 is equivalent to ""event3 happens"" (event3 ∧ event3 is just event3).
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" ≡ ""event3 happens and event1 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1 or event3) can occur at any later time.
- The other rules (after event1 → event3, after event3 → event1 or event2) only matter if event1 or event3 could occur at all.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, neither event1 nor event3 can ever occur.
- Therefore event3 does not happen, so C1 is false, and hence C2 (which requires event3 and event1) is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 is ""event3 happens"" (the conjunction ""event3 and event3"" is just event3).
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — so C2 requires both event3 and event1 to happen.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has happened, no further events occur.)
- The other rules (""after event1 → event3"" and ""after event3 → either event1 or event2"") cannot be triggered if no events occur after event2.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after it, neither event3 nor event1 can occur subsequently.
- Therefore C1 (event3) is false, and hence C2 (event3 and event1) is also false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen, so the immediate next state has event1.
- C1 says “Event1 always happens” — i.e. in every future step/event, event1 holds.
- But after event1 the rules allow either event2 or event3. If the choice is event3, then event3 (not event1) occurs and is terminal (no further events). That future violates “event1 always happens.”
- Therefore, even in the next state (which is event1), C1 need not hold (there is a permitted continuation to event3 that falsifies it).

So C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially E2 happens.
- After E2, E1 must happen, so the next state indeed has E1.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is a global claim that at every future step event1 occurs. That is already false at the initial state (initial event was E2), but the question asks whether C1 holds in the next state.
- From the next state (where E1 just happened), the rules allow two possibilities: either E2 next (which forces E1 again later), or E3 next. If E3 happens, no further events occur, so there is a future state (right after E3) where event1 does not occur.
- Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state (there is a valid continuation violating ""always event1"").

So C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the statements
- ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) means: from a given state forward, Event1 will hold in every future relevant state (i.e., it is a guaranteed, global property of all continuations).
- ""C1 holds in the next state"" (C2) asks whether that property (Event1 always happens) is true starting from the state immediately after the initial one.

Step 2 — use the given rules to build possible traces
- Initially Event2 happened (given).
- After Event2, Event1 must happen. So the next step is Event1.
- After Event1, either Event2 or Event3 must happen.
  - If Event2 happens, the pattern can repeat (Event2 → Event1 → ...).
  - If Event3 happens, by the rule “after Event3, no other events can happen,” the trace terminates (no further Event1s).

Step 3 — find a counterexample to C1 holding in the next state
- Starting from the next state (where Event1 has just occurred), choose the allowed continuation: after Event1, choose Event3. Then the trace ends and no further Event1 occurs. Thus Event1 does not “always happen” on that continuation.
- Because there is an allowed continuation from the next state where Event1 fails to hold thereafter, C1 is not guaranteed in the next state.

Conclusion
C2 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible evolution given the rules, both event2 and event3 occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event1 has already happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any further events from occurring at all.
- Therefore neither event2 nor event3 can occur in any allowed evolution.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- C1 requires event2 and event3 to happen, but neither can occur given the rules and the initial event1.
- So C1 does not hold in any evolution, and certainly does not always hold.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event3 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every possible permitted sequence, both event2 and event3 happen.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Because event1 occurs initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any further events from occurring at any time after the initial moment.
- Therefore event2 and event3 cannot occur in any allowed sequence (they cannot occur after the initial event1, and there is no ""before"" the initial moment).
- Since event2 and event3 never occur, C1 (""event2 and event3 happen"") is false in every allowed sequence.

Conclusion
- C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False.

Final answer: False

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every possible execution, both event2 and event3 occur).

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).
- After event3, event1 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — Reasoning about possible sequences:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no events can occur after the initial state. That prevents event2 and event3 from ever occurring in any execution starting from the given initial condition.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 and event3 happen"") is false for the (and thus every) possible execution.
- Since C1 does not hold in the actual executions, it certainly does not ""always hold.""

- The other rules (""After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."") are irrelevant if event1 or event2 cannot occur at all.

Step 2 — what can happen:
- Because event3 happened initially and no events can happen after event3, neither event1 nor event2 can happen at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate the hypotheses:
- C1 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") is false (neither happens).
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is false because both disjuncts are false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". C1 is ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"". So C2 simplifies to just ""Event1 happens"" (A or (A and B) ≡ A).

- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event3 happened initially and no events can happen after event3, no other events (including event1) can occur at any time.
- Therefore Event1 does not happen, and C1 (Event1 and Event2) also does not hold.

Conclusion:
- C2 (equivalently, ""Event1 happens"") is false.

Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1 = (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2 = (event1 happens) OR C1. Note C2 is logically equivalent to (event1 happens) (because A OR (A AND B) = A).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen → event3 is terminal; nothing occurs after it.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (only relevant if event1 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would be terminal too).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Because event3 happened initially and is terminal, no events can occur after it. So the only possible sequence consistent with the context is: [event3].
- In particular, event1 does not happen in any allowed sequence. Therefore event2 also does not happen.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ""Event1 does happen.""
The question: Given the rules, is C2 true? Equivalently, must Event1 occur?

Step 2 — interpret the rules
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event3, event2 must occur.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must occur.
- After event1, event2 must occur.

Step 3 — construct a sequence that satisfies all rules but never has event1
- Start: event2 (given).
- After that event2, choose event3.
- After event3, rule requires event2.
- After that event2, choose event3 again.
- Repeat: ... event2, event3, event2, event3, ...
All rules are satisfied; event1 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because there is a valid behavior (the repeating event2↔event3 sequence) in which Event1 never happens, C1 can hold, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is not forced true.

Final answer: False
---
First, restate the hypotheses:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 does happen).

Examine the rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Trace possible sequences:
- From the initial event2, we may choose event3. Then event3 forces event2, and from that event2 we may again choose event3, and so on. This produces an infinite sequence …->event2->event3->event2->event3… in which event1 never occurs. Thus a model exists where C1 holds (event1 does not happen).
- Because such a sequence is allowed by the rules, event1 is not forced to occur in every possible model.

Conclusion:
C2 (""Event1 happens"") is not guaranteed by the premises, so C2 is False.
---
First identify the hypothesis: C2 says ""C1 does not hold"", and C1 is ""Event1 does not happen"". So C2 asserts that Event1 does happen.

From the premises:
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Starting from the initial event2 we can choose:
- Option 1: event1 next — then event1 does happen (so C2 would be true in this run).
- Option 2: event3 next — then event2 must happen, and we can again choose event3, yielding an infinite cycle event2 → event3 → event2 → ... with no event1 ever occurring.

Because there is a valid sequence (the repeating event2→event3 cycle) in which Event1 never happens, C1 can hold, so C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore C2 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens."" (i.e. either event3 happens in the next state, or event3 happens (at some point).)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (next).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so if event1 happens next, event3 happens in the state after that).
- After event3, event1 must happen (not needed for the answer but enforces alternation once event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace possibilities from the initial state
- If after the initial event2, event3 happens next, then C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- If instead event1 happens next, then by ""after event1, event3 must happen"" event3 will occur in the following state. So even though C1 is false in this branch, the disjunct ""event3 happens"" is true, so C2 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In every allowed branch starting from the initial event2, event3 occurs either in the next state or in the state after that. Therefore C2 is necessarily true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened. The rule ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" means in the next state we get either event1 or event3.
- Case 1: If event3 happens in the next state, then C1 is true, so C2 (C1 or event3) is true.
- Case 2: If event1 happens in the next state, then by ""After event1, event3 must happen"" event3 will occur in the following state. So event3 does happen (eventually), making the disjunction C1 or event3 true.
- In every possible continuation, at least one disjunct of C2 holds, so C2 is True.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event3 happens.""

2. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (in the next state).

3. Consider the possible next-state outcomes:
   - If event3 happens next, then C1 is true and so C2 is true in that branch.
   - But if event1 happens next (which is allowed by the ""either event1 or event3"" rule), then C1 is false (event3 does not happen in the next state). Event3 has not happened initially either, so the plain ""event3 happens"" disjunct is also false in that scenario. (Although event3 will then be forced to happen after event1, that is in the following state, not the immediate next state.)

4. Because there is an allowed execution where neither C1 nor the plain ""event3 happens"" (in the current/next-state sense required by C2) holds, C2 is not guaranteed by the given information.

Therefore C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:  
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""  
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (equivalently: event1 happens and event2 happens, with event2 mentioned again)

Step 2 — apply the conditions in the context:  
- Initially event1 happened, so event1 has occurred.  
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → because event1 occurred, event2 must (and therefore will) occur.  
- Once event2 occurs, ""after event2, event1 must happen"" → event1 will occur again. (This creates an alternating sequence, but does not prevent either event from occurring.)

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:  
- Since event1 occurred initially and event2 must occur afterwards, both event1 and event2 do happen → C1 is true.  
- C2 requires C1 to hold and event2 to happen; both are satisfied (event2 does happen), so C2 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context rules.

Step 2 — restate the hypothesis
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens. (So C2 is equivalent to “event1 happens and event2 happens” — the extra “and event2” is redundant.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 is true at the start.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So because event1 occurred, event2 will occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So once event2 occurs, event1 will occur again.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant unless event3 occurs; it’s not needed here.)

Step 4 — trace the sequence
- Initially event1 occurs.
- By the “after event1” rule, event2 must then occur.
- By the “after event2” rule, event1 must then occur (again).
- Thus both event1 and event2 do occur.

Step 5 — conclusion
- C1 is true (both event1 and event2 happen).
- Therefore C2 (which is equivalent to C1) is also true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 already asserts event2 happens, C2 is equivalent to C1 (both mean: event1 happens and event2 happens).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 has occurred at least once.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Any occurrence of event1 forces a subsequent occurrence of event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Any occurrence of event2 forces a subsequent occurrence of event1.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant unless event3 occurs; we have no requirement that event3 occurs.)

Step 3 — Trace the sequence
- At the start event1 has occurred.
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get that event2 occurs after that.
- Having event2 occur triggers ""after event2, event1 must happen"", so event1 occurs (again or at least one more time).
- Thus both event1 and event2 occur (each at least once).

Step 4 — Conclusion
- C1 is satisfied, therefore C2 (equivalent to C1) is satisfied.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (a disjunction: at least one of event2 or event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 has occurred at least once.)
- Other rules describe what must follow after events, but they do not negate the initial occurrence.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1
- Since event2 happened initially, the disjunction ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" is satisfied. Therefore C1 holds (is True).

Step 4 — Conclude about C2
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold. Because C1 does hold, C2 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
C2 is the statement ""C1 does not hold."" The question asks whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret C1:
C1 = ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""

Step 3 — use the context:
The context begins by saying ""Initially, event2 happened."" That makes ""Event2 happens"" true (at least at the initial point).

Step 4 — conclude:
Since Event2 happens, C1 is true. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or Event1 happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = not(C1).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- The very first statement: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So Event2 is true at the start.

Step 3 — reason:
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since Event2 happened, C1 is true.

Step 4 — conclude:
- C2 = not(C1) is therefore false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First: what the hypothesis asks
- C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. ""at some future point, it will be true that event2 eventually happens.""

Examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. So at the initial moment event3 has occurred.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" That means once event3 has occurred, no further events can occur at any later time.
- The other rules (""After event2, event3 must happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen"") are irrelevant if event2 and event1 never occur.

Trace possible event sequences
- Because event3 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event3, there can be no occurrence of event2 at any later time.
- Therefore event2 does not happen at any point.

Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false, since event2 will never occur.
- C2 (""eventually C1"") asks whether at some future time it becomes true that event2 will eventually happen. But since no events can happen after the initial event3, C1 is false at all times; it never becomes true. Thus C2 is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claims
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. ""Eventually, (event2 eventually happens)."" (Note: eventually eventually p is equivalent to eventually p.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Since event3 already happened initially, no events can ever happen after the initial moment.
- The other rules (""after event2, event3 must happen"" and ""after event1, no other events can happen"") cannot enable event2 because they require event2 or event1 to occur first.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Since event3 has already occurred and blocks any further events, event2 cannot occur now or at any future time.

Step 4 — conclude
- C1 is false (event2 will not eventually happen).
- C2 is also false (C1 will never become true at any future point).

Final answer:
False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e. at some time in the future event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future time the statement C1 is true).

Examine the conditions and consequences:
1. Initially event3 happened.
2. ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Since event3 already happened initially, no events can occur at any later time.
3. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any future time (there is no opportunity for further events).
4. Hence C1 is false at the initial point (and remains false forever).
5. C2 asks that at some future time C1 becomes true. Since no events can occur in the future and C1 is false now, C1 can never become true later. Also note F(F p) = F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1 here.

Conclusion: C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" So C2 is true exactly when event2 occurs and, moreover, event2 always occurs.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 is not said to have happened).
""Must happen"" means the sequence of events is forced by the given rules.

Step 3 — trace the forced sequence
- Start: event3 happened.
- By the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" → event2 happens.
- Then by ""after event2, event3 must happen"" → event3 happens again.
- This repeats: 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → ... indefinitely.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- In that forced infinite alternation, event2 occurs repeatedly (every second event), so event2 always happens (i.e., it recurs and cannot be avoided). Thus C1 is true.
- Since event2 does happen (indeed repeatedly) and C1 holds, C2 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's asked:
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 does not occur initially and is irrelevant to the initial chain).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- From the initial event3, the rule ""after event3 → event2"" forces event2 to occur.
- Once event2 occurs, the rule ""after event2 → event3"" forces event3 to occur again, and then that again forces event2, and so on. This creates an eternal alternation of event3 and event2.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): Given the enforced alternation starting from the initial event3, event2 will occur (and recur) inevitably — so C1 holds.
- Event2 happens (at least once) as just shown, and C1 holds, so C2 is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
You ask whether C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. (So from the initial event3, event2 will occur.)
- After event2, event3 must happen. (So every time event2 occurs, event3 will follow.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 hasn’t been given as occurring.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Start: event3 has happened.
- By ""after event3, event2 must happen"" → event2 happens.
- By ""after event2, event3 must happen"" → event3 happens again.
- That triggers event2 again, and so on. Thus event2 does occur (indeed repeatedly/in perpetuity).

Step 4 — evaluate the claims:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): given the initial event3 and the enforced 3→2 and 2→3 cycle, event2 will occur and continue to occur, so C1 holds.
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds""): since event2 does happen and C1 is true, C2 is true.

Sample responses:
First identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the immediate successor state, event1 will eventually happen.

Examine the constraints and trace the possible events:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen, so the next event is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen — the system ends after event2.
- (The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs in this scenario.)

Starting from the initial state, the sequence is: event3, then event2, then termination. Event1 never occurs, so C1 is false in the initial state. In the next state (after event2 has occurred), no events can happen, so event1 cannot occur later — C1 is also false in that next state.

Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""event1 eventually happens.""
- From the facts: initially event3 happened, and after event3 event2 must happen. Once event2 happens, no other events can happen.
- Therefore event2 will occur (after event3) and that ends the sequence, so event1 can never occur at any time.
- Hence C1 is false in the initial state, and it is also false in the next state. So C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- Initially event3 happened. The rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" means the next state is either event1 or event2.
- Therefore C1 (event1 happens next) is possible but not certain (it could be event2 instead).
- C2 asserts that C1 does not hold (i.e., event1 does not happen next). That is not guaranteed by the conditions (there is a model where event1 does happen).
- Hence C2 is not true in all cases, so the correct answer is False.
---
We start in a state where event3 just happened. The rules say:
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen next.
So the next state could have event1 or could have event2. C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is possible but not guaranteed. C2 asserts the negation of C1 (""C1 does not hold"" — i.e., event1 does not happen next). That is also possible but not guaranteed.

Since the premises do not force C2 to be true (event1 might occur), C2 is not entailed. Therefore C2 is False.
---
We are asked whether C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true given the context.

1) Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event1 happens in the next state."" C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 does not happen next).

2) From the context: initially event3 occurred. The rule ""After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" therefore applies to the next state.

3) That rule allows two possibilities for the next state: event1 happens, or event2 happens. Event1 is possible but not guaranteed, and event2 is also possible.

4) C2 asserts that event1 does not happen next. Because event1 could happen, C2 is not guaranteed by the context and thus is not true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis: C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"", where C1 is ""Event3 does not happen.""

Examine conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened. So C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
- Given C1 is false, C2 (""Event2 happens or C1"") reduces to ""Event2 happens.""
- The context gives rules that after event1 → event3, after event3 → event1, and after event2 → event3. None of these rules require event2 to occur.

Trace:
- Because event3 happened initially, event1 must happen (by after event3 → event1), and then event3 must happen again (by after event1 → event3). This cycle does not force event2.
- There is no rule or fact forcing event2 to happen.

Conclusion:
C2 is not guaranteed by the context (it would only be true if event2 happens, which is not required). Therefore the correct answer is:

False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The context says event3 happened initially, so C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is false, C2 reduces to ""Event2 happens"".
- Nothing in the context forces event2 to occur (the rules only force alternation between event3 and event1, and require event3 after event2 if event2 were to occur).
- Therefore C2 is not guaranteed by the context, so C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e. Event2 ∨ ¬Event3)

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially, event3 happened. So Event3 is true.
- From ""after event3, event1 must happen"" we get Event1 must happen (so Event1 is true).
- From ""after event1, event3 must happen"" we still have Event3 true.
- ""After event2, event3 must happen"" places a requirement if Event2 happens, but it does not force Event2.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Since Event3 is true, C1 (""Event3 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 simplifies to ""Event2 happens"".
- The context does not assert or imply that Event2 happens, so Event2 is not guaranteed true.

Conclusion:
- C2 is not entailed by the context, so the correct answer is:

False"

C2 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is just the same as ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"", i.e. ""Event2 always holds (at every point).""
- From the rules: initially event1 happened. At that moment event2 is not happening, so C1 is false there. Also after event2 the rule forces event1 to happen, so there are times when event1 (not event2) holds.
- Although every run will eventually include an occurrence of event2, event2 does not hold at all times. Therefore the claim that C1 always holds is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 claims ""C1 always holds."" C1 is ""Event1 always happens."" So we must decide whether it is guaranteed (in all possible executions given the context) that event1 happens.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is also terminal)
- After event2, event3 must happen (but that doesn't matter if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — reason about possible executions
- The initial state already has event3 happened.
- Because event3 is terminal, no further events (including event1) can occur after the initial state.
- The context does not state that event1 has already happened initially; it only states event3 did.
- Therefore there is at least one valid execution (the initial one) in which event1 does not happen.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is not guaranteed, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., C1 is true)

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (event3 is terminal)
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is also terminal)

Step 3 — Trace and reason
- Because event3 has already happened initially and event3 is terminal, no further events (including event1) can occur in the actual trace.
- Therefore there is a trace where event1 does not happen, so the claim ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- If C1 is false, then the claim ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in all possible executions).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules: after event2, event3 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen.)

Step 3 — reason about possible executions:
- Because event3 happens initially and after event3 no other events can happen, the system stops immediately after the initial event3.
- Therefore event1 does not occur in that execution.
- Since there is at least one execution (the initial one) where event1 does not happen, C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- Consequently C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

Examine the conditions (transition rules):
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event3 must happen. (2 -> 3)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (3 -> 1)
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. (1 -> {2,3})

Reasoning about possible sequences:
- From the initial 2 we are forced: 2,3,1,...
- At each occurrence of 1 we can choose either 2 or 3 next.
  - If we always choose 2 at every 1, we get the repeating cycle 2,3,1,2,3,1,... In that trace event2 occurs infinitely often but not at every step.
  - If at some 1 we choose 3 (and keep choosing 3), we get 2,3,1,3,1,3,1,... which never has another event2 after the initial one.

Can C1 ever hold?
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"" meaning event2 occurs at every step) is impossible under the rules: after an event2 there must be event3, and after event3 there is event1, so non-2 events must occur. Thus C1 cannot be true at any time.

Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Identify the hypothesis:
  - C1 = ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., from any point on, every state is event2, G event2).
  - C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there exists a future point after which C1 holds, F G event2).

- Understand the conditions:
  - Initially event2 occurs.
  - After event2 must come event3.
  - After event3 must come event1.
  - After event1 must come either event2 or event3.

- Trace possible sequences:
  - Starting from the initial event2 we must have: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> (2 or 3) -> ...
  - If after 1 we choose 2, we get the repeating cycle 2,3,1,2,3,1,... — event2 occurs periodically but not at every step.
  - If after 1 we choose 3, we get 2,3,1,3,1,3,... — event2 may stop occurring entirely after the initial one.

- Key observation: whenever event2 occurs, the next event must be event3. Therefore it is impossible from any point onward to have every state be event2. So C1 (that event2 holds at every future state) can never become true at any point, hence F G event2 is false.

Therefore C2 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" I interpret this in the usual temporal sense as a global invariant: from a given point onward, every step/event is event2.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That asks whether there is some future point after which C1 is true (i.e., from that point on event2 holds at every step).

Step 2 — examine the conditions / transition rules
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event2, event3 must occur.
- After event3, event1 must occur.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must occur.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Starting from the initial event2, the next forced event is e3, then e1. So one sequence is: e2, e3, e1, ...
- From e1 there are two choices:
  - If e1 → e2, we get the repeating cycle e2, e3, e1, e2, e3, e1, ... (periodic with all three events).
  - If e1 → e3, we get the cycle e1, e3, e1, e3, ... (no event2 after that point).
- In both possible continuations there are steps where the event is not event2 (either e3 or e1).

Step 4 — conclude about C1 and C2
- Because whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event3, you can never reach a point after which every subsequent event is event2. Thus C1 (that event2 always happens from some point onward) can never become true.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is False.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 is true given the constraints.
- C1 = (event3 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2 = C1 AND (event3 happens). (So C2 just restates that event3 and event2 happen.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So event2 happens (following the initial event3).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (one of them will occur).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- From the initial event3 we get event2 (so both event3 and event2 occur). That makes C1 true.
- Since event3 already occurs (the initial one), C2 (which just requires event3 and event2) is also true.

Conclusion
True
---
True

Reasoning (step by step):

- The context states: initially event3 happened.
- From ""after event3, event2 must happen"" we deduce event2 happens (after the initial event3).
- So both event3 and event2 happen — C1 holds.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event3 happens"". Event3 already happened initially, so C2 is satisfied as well.

Therefore C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 says: event3 happens and event2 happens.
- C2 says: C1 holds and event3 happens. (Logically C2 ≡ event3 ∧ event2 ∧ event3 ≡ event3 ∧ event2, so C2 is equivalent to C1.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen → so event2 will occur (after the initial event3).
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur after that.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen → at least one of them will occur next.
(Any choice preserves that both event3 (initially) and event2 (after initial event3) have occurred.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- t0: event3 (given).
- t1: event2 (forced by after event3 → event2).
- So both event3 and event2 have occurred; C1 is satisfied.
- Since C2 is just C1 plus event3 again (which is already true), C2 is also satisfied.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens).
- C1 says: event3 always happens (i.e., event3 inevitably occurs in the run).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. => from the initial event2, event1 will occur.
- After event1, event3 must happen. => once event1 occurs, event3 will occur.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. => the system continues, but this does not prevent the earlier occurrences.

Step 3 — trace the forced sequence from the initial event:
- Start: event2 (given).
- By rule, after event2 → event1 occurs.
- By rule, after event1 → event3 occurs.
So event1 and event3 both occur (at least once). After event3 the system continues, but that does not invalidate these occurrences.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (event3 always happens / is inevitable): True, because the initial event2 forces event1 which forces event3.
- C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens): True, because we have shown event3 is forced (C1) and event1 does indeed occur.

Final answer:
True
---
Step‑by‑step:

- Initially event2 happens.
- Rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 to occur next.
- Rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to occur after that.
- Rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" gives two options:
  - If event1 happens, then by the rule after event1 event3 must happen again.
  - If event2 happens, then by the rule after event2 event1 must happen, and then by the rule after event1 event3 must happen.
- In every case, event3 does occur (indeed it occurs now and will recur on every cycle), and event1 does occur (immediately after the initial event2).

Therefore C1 (""Event3 always happens"") holds, and event1 does happen, so C2 is true.

True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: (C1 holds) AND (event1 happens).
- C1 asserts: ""Event3 always happens"" — read as ""event3 holds at every time/state"".

Step 2 — examine the rules
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s)
- Start: time0 = event2.
- time1 (after event2) = event1 (forced).
- time2 (after event1) = event3 (forced).
- time3 (after event3) = either event1 or event2. In either choice the future returns to event1 and then event3, so event3 occurs repeatedly, but not at every time step.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""event3 always happens"" at every time) is false because at time1 we have event1 (not event3). So event3 does not hold at all times.
- Event1 does happen (time1), so the second conjunct is true, but C2 requires both, so C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C2 says: ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""Event1 happens and Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (so event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities:
- Because event3 has already happened initially and no events can occur after event3, neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any later time.
- Could event1 or event2 have occurred before the initial event3? No — the statement says event3 happened initially (the timeline starts there), and requirements like ""after event1, event3 must happen"" would require event3 to occur after event1, which contradicts event3 already being initial. Thus event1 cannot occur at any point.
- Therefore it's impossible for both event1 and event2 to happen (C1 is impossible).

Conclusion:
- C1 never holds, so it cannot eventually hold.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (i.e., both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., at some future point both event1 and event2 will have happened).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. So at the start event3 has already occurred.
- ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Once event3 has occurred, no further events can occur thereafter.
- ""After event1, event3 must happen."" If event1 ever occurs, event3 must occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" If event2 occurs, then no further events can occur after it.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- Because event3 already happened initially, the rule ""after event3 no other events can happen"" forbids any events occurring after that point. Therefore neither event1 nor event2 can occur later.
- Could event1 and event2 have occurred before event3? No, because the context states event3 happened initially (at the start); there is no earlier time where other events could have happened.
- The condition ""after event1, event3 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event3 already happened and event1 cannot occur after it.
- Similarly, ""after event2, no other events can happen"" doesn't enable event2 to occur before event3.

Step 4 — conclusion
- It is impossible for both event1 and event2 to occur at any time given the initial event3 and the rule that no events can occur after event3.
- Therefore C1 cannot eventually hold, so C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (both occur at some point).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future point both event1 and event2 occur.
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. (So once event3 has occurred, the system is “dead”; no further events.)
- After event1, event3 must happen. (If event1 occurs, event3 will then occur and thus prevent further events.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs, it also ends further activity.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- Because event3 has already happened in the initial state, the rule “after event3, no other events can happen” means no events can occur after the initial state. Therefore neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any later time.
- The other rules (event1 → event3, event2 → no more events) do not enable event1 or event2 to happen before the initial event3; the initial state already contains event3 and there is no allowance for prior events.
- Hence it is impossible for both event1 and event2 to occur (together or at any time after the initial state).

Conclusion:

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That asks whether C1 is entailed by the given conditions (i.e., whether whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen in all allowed sequences).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. (That's an instance of event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is an explicit rule: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must follow.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant to C1 except it also forces event1 after event3.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Makes event1 terminal.)

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" directly entails C1: any occurrence of event2 requires a subsequent event1.
- Because that rule is part of the conditions, there is no allowed sequence where event2 happens without event1 following. The other conditions are consistent with this (e.g., once event1 occurs nothing else happens).

Conclusion:
- C1 is enforced by the given rules, so C1 always holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Explanation (concise): The context explicitly states ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That is exactly the content of C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens""). Because this is a global rule in the scenario, C1 always holds, so C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens (an implication).
- C2: C1 always holds (the implication is universally true given the context).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. (Concrete occurrence.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (A rule: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must follow.)
- After event3, event1 must happen. (Another rule, irrelevant to event2 except also forcing event1.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal; it does not prevent event1 itself.)

Step 3 — reasoning about C1 and C2:
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" directly entails the implication in C1: every time event2 happens, event1 must happen afterward.
- There is no rule that can prevent event1 from happening after event2; the ""after event1 no other events"" rule only restricts events after event1, not the occurrence of event1 itself.
- Therefore the implication in C1 is guaranteed by the given context, so C1 holds in all allowed traces.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" (where C1 is ""Event1 always happens""). We must decide whether C2 can be true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 has happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event1 would require event3 afterward).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possibilities
- Since event3 already happened initially and it is terminal, no further events can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur (there is no opportunity for any event after the initial event3).
- Because event2 cannot occur, the conjunct ""Event2 happens"" in C2 is false. Also, event1 cannot occur after the initial event3, so ""Event1 always happens"" cannot hold.

Conclusion
- C2 is False.
---
Reasoning:
1. Initially event3 has already happened.
2. After event3, no other events can happen — so no event can occur later than this initial event3.
3. If event1 were to happen, the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" requires a later occurrence of event3. But no events can occur after the initial event3, so event1 cannot occur.
4. Therefore C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
5. C2 asserts ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 cannot be true (even without checking event2).

Final answer:
False
---
Answering the hypothesis: C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is False.

Reasoning step by step:
- Hypothesis C2 asserts both that Event2 happens, and C1 (""Event1 always happens"") holds.
- From the context: initially Event3 happened, and after Event3 no other events can happen. Thus once Event3 has occurred (and it already has), no Event1 or Event2 can occur at any time.
- Therefore Event2 does not happen, and Event1 does not always happen.
- Since both parts of C2 are not satisfied, C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- C1 says “event1 eventually happens.” That is true overall because event1 happens initially.
- C2 says “C1 holds in the next state,” i.e. from the state immediately after the initial one, event1 will eventually happen.
- From the rules: after the initial event1, event2 must happen; after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen; after event3 no further events occur.
- A valid trace is: state0: event1 (initial) → state1: event2 → state2: event3 → end. In this trace, from state1 onward event1 never occurs.
- Therefore C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state, so C2 is not guaranteed. Hence False.
---
First identify the claims:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: starting from the next state, event1 will eventually happen in all possible futures from that state.

Examine the conditions and possible traces:
- Initially event1 happened, so the initial state is event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so the next state is event2.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
  - If event1 happens after event2, then event1 does eventually occur from that next state.
  - If event3 happens after event2, then by ""after event3, no other events can happen"" the run terminates and event1 never occurs from that point.

Because from the next state (which is event2) there is a possible future where event3 occurs and then event1 never occurs, C1 does not hold in all futures of the next state. Therefore C2 is not guaranteed.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (This is a global eventuality.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" i.e. in the state immediately after the initial one, it is still true that event1 will eventually happen.

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event1 has happened → C1 is true in the initial state.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so after the initial event1, event2 will occur sometime).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — construct possible traces
- One allowed trace: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... (event1 recurs).
- Another allowed trace: event1 → event2 → event3 and then stop (no more events).

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- From the next state (immediately after the initial event1), it is possible that the sequence goes event2 then event3 and no further event1 occurs. So from that next state it is not guaranteed that ""event1 eventually happens.""
- Hence C1 does not necessarily hold in the next state.

Sample responses:
Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happens.
- From ""After event2, event3 must happen"" we get a sequence: event2 then event3.
- Nothing in the conditions requires event1 to occur before or at all.
- In the sequence (event2, event3), event3 happens but event1 does not, so ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens"" is violated.

Therefore C2 is False. 

False

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: If event3 happens, then event1 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds (i.e., C1 is entailed by the rules).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen, but that is irrelevant if event1 never occurs.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequence:
- Starting from the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces the sequence event2 → event3.
- In that sequence event1 never occurs, yet event3 does occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""if event3 happens, then event1 happens"") is false in the sequence event2 → event3 (event3 occurs without event1).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Hypothesis C1: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" C2 says C1 always holds (i.e., in every allowed trace).
- From the context: initially event2 has happened. Also ""after event2, event3 must happen,"" and ""after event3, no other events can happen.""
- Starting from the initial state (event2 already happened), event3 must occur next, producing the trace: event2 → event3. In that trace event1 never occurred.
- This is a valid trace allowed by the rules, yet it contains event3 without event1. That is a counterexample to C1.
Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 says ""Event1 happens or event3 happens"" (read as ""at the current moment either event1 or event3 occurs"").
- From the context, initially event1 occurs, and after event1 the next step may be event2. At that step event2 is occurring, so neither event1 nor event3 is occurring then — C1 is false at that moment.
- Therefore C1 does not hold at all times (there are reachable moments when event2 occurs and C1 is false). Hence ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event3 happens."" (i.e., at the current step, either event1 occurs or event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., at every point in the future, either event1 or event3 occurs).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event1 happened (so C1 is true at the initial point).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event1, one allowed choice is: event1 → event2.
- After that event2, the rules permit event1 again: event1 → event2 → event1.
- Repeating choices can produce an infinite alternating sequence event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … that never includes event3.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- At the moments when event2 occurs, neither event1 nor event3 is occurring at that moment, so C1 is false at those points.
- Thus there are reachable states where C1 does not hold, so C1 is not true at all times.

Final answer:
False
---
C2 is False.

Reasoning:
- C1 asserts ""Event1 happens or event3 happens."" At the initial moment C1 is true because event1 happened initially.
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., at every point/state).
- But after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. It is allowed that event2 happens next. At the moment event2 occurs neither event1 nor event3 is occurring, so C1 is false at that state.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must evaluate whether the statement C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") is true or false given the context. C1 is ""Event1 always happens.""

Step 2 — Understand the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Trace the event sequence
- Since initially event2 happened, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to happen.
- After event3 occurs, no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur after that.
- There is no information allowing event1 to have happened before the initial event2; the context fixes that event2 happened initially. So C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.

Step 4 — Evaluate C2
- C2 is ""Event3 happens or C1 holds.""
- We have established event3 does happen, so the disjunction is true regardless of C1.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C2 is the disjunction ""Event3 happens OR C1 holds"" (where C1 = ""Event1 always happens""). We must decide if C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. => because event2 did happen initially, event3 will happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
Because event2 happened initially and that forces event3, the actual sequence includes event2 then event3. After event3 no further events can occur, so event1 cannot occur after event3. Event1 also could not have occurred before the initial event2 (that would have prevented event2), so event1 does not (and cannot) always happen. Thus C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
Event3 does happen (as shown), so the disjunction ""Event3 happens or C1 holds"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
First, what's being asked: is C2 (""Event3 happens or C1 holds"") true given the context?

Examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. => event3 does happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2, event3 must happen"", event3 will occur. Because event3 occurs and after event3 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur at any time in this execution; so C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.

C2 is a disjunction: ""Event3 happens or C1 holds."" Since event3 does happen, the disjunction is true (regardless of C1).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First identify the statements:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. from some state, the immediate next event is event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point there is a state whose next event is event2).

Examine the constraints:

- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- After event3, no further events can occur (event3 is terminal).

From the initial event1, one allowed next event is event3. If we choose that, the sequence is 1 → 3 and then nothing else happens. In that execution event2 never occurs, so there is no state whose next event is event2. Thus C2 fails in that possible run.

Because the constraints allow an execution (1 → 3) where C1 never becomes true, C2 is not guaranteed. Therefore the correct answer is:

False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (i.e., at some state, the immediate next event is event2.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some point along the execution there is a state whose next event is event2 — equivalently, event2 occurs at least once in some next-step.)

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- From the initial event1, one possible next event is event2; in that case C1 holds immediately and thus C2 holds in that run.
- But from the initial event1, another possible next event is event3. If event3 happens next, then no further events can occur (terminal), so event2 never occurs and C1 never holds in that run.

Step 4 — conclusion:
Because there is a valid execution (initial event1 → event3) in which C1 never holds, C2 is not guaranteed to hold. Therefore C2 is False.

False
---
First, clarify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. at some moment the immediate next event is event2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e. at some future point there will be a moment whose next event is event2).

Examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 occurred.
- From event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
- From event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- From event3, no further events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Construct possible traces starting from the initial event1. One possible trace is:
- event1 → event3, and then stop (because event3 is terminal).

In that trace, event2 never occurs, so there is no future point at which ""the next event is event2"" (C1 never becomes true). Therefore C2 (""eventually C1"") is not guaranteed by the given conditions.

(If one instead interprets ""eventually"" existentially as “there exists a possible run where C1 holds,” then C2 would be true because event1 → event2 is a possible run. But under the usual reading as a required consequence for all possible executions, C2 is false.)

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: C1 does not hold (i.e., Event2 does not eventually happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 is required after the initial event1, so event2 will occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen → leads to a repeat cycle (event1 → event2 → event1 → ...).
- After event3, no other events can happen → event3 would stop further events, but nothing forces event3 to occur, and it cannot validly occur in place of event2 because event2 is required after event1.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Starting point: event1 has occurred. Because event2 must happen after event1, event2 will eventually occur.
- Once event2 occurs, the cycle with event1 continues; event3 is not forced and cannot preempt the required event2.

Conclusion:
- C1 is true (event2 does eventually happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event2 does not eventually happen""). We must decide if C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 is required to occur following the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they may alternate).
- After event3, no other events can happen (irrelevant unless event3 occurs).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Since event1 has happened and event2 must happen after event1, event2 will eventually occur.
- Once event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward, and so on; this ensures at least one occurrence of event2.
- Event3 could stop further events only if it occurs, but it cannot preempt the required event2 that must follow the initial event1.

Conclusion:
- C1 (event2 eventually happens) is true, so C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ""Event2 does not eventually happen"").

We must decide whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So once event1 occurred, event2 is required to occur at some later point.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (They force alternation between event1 and event2.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Event3 would be terminal, but nothing forces event3.)

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- We start with event1. The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" implies event2 will occur after that event1. Therefore event2 eventually happens.
- Once event2 happens, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" brings event1 again, and so on — producing at least one occurrence of event2 and then continued alternation.
- The only way to avoid event2 would be for some other event (e.g., event3) to occur before event2 and block further events, but nothing in the rules allows event3 to preempt the requirement that event2 must happen after event1. So that preemption is not permitted by the given constraints.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C1 is true (event2 does eventually happen).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no events (including event3) can occur after that initial state.
- Therefore event3 does not always happen (it never occurs in any future state), so C1 is false.
- If C1 is false now, it cannot become true in the next state either (there are no events to make event3 always happen), so C2 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every state, event3 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., starting from the state immediately after the current one, event3 holds in every state).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. So the very next state is ""after event2.""
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So in the next state (and all states after that), no events (including event3) can occur.
- The other rules (""After event3, event2 must happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen"") do not enable event3 to occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — reason about C2:
- C2 requires that, in the next state (which is after event2), event3 holds in every state from there on.
- But the rule ""After event2, no other events can happen"" prevents event3 from occurring in the next state or any future state.
- Therefore C1 cannot hold in the next state; C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., at all future points event3 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — does C1 become true at the immediate next state?

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system is terminal after that event).
- (Other rules: after event3, event2 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen — these don't force event3 to occur.)

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Since event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event3 cannot occur now or in the future.
- Therefore C1 (""event3 always happens"") is false in the current state (there is no occurrence of event3).
- In the next state there are likewise no possible events, so C1 is not made true in the next state.

Conclusion
- C2 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C2 is the claim ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" (where C1 = ""Event2 always happens"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — produce a permitted trace that refutes C2:
- From the initial event3, choose the allowed successor event1 (the rules permit either event1 or event2).
- After event1, no further events can occur, so event2 never happens in this trace.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false in this trace, and ""event2 happens"" is also false here.

Since there is a valid sequence where neither disjunct holds, C2 is not true in general.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C2 asserts: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
- C1 asserts: ""Event2 always happens.""

Step 2 — understand the rules
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so event2 leads back to event3).

Step 3 — examine possible traces
- One allowed trace: event3 (initial) → event1. Because after event3 you may choose event1, and after event1 nothing more happens. In this trace event2 never occurs.
  - In that trace, ""Event2 happens"" is false, and ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is also false (counterexample).
- Other traces exist where event2 does occur (e.g., event3 → event2 → event3 → …), but existence of those does not make the claim true in all cases.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there is a valid trace where neither disjunct holds, C2 is not guaranteed by the context.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (i.e. either event2 occurs in the run, or event2 occurs in every run)

Examine the conditions and possible runs:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- If event1 happens, no further events can happen.

Trace a run that follows the rules:
- Start: event3.
- Choose the branch ""after event3 → event1"".
- After event1, the sequence ends. In this run, event2 does not occur.

Evaluate C1 and C2 on that run:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because we have at least one valid run (the one above) where event2 does not happen.
- ""Event2 happens"" is false in this run.
- Therefore C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is false in this run.

Since C2 is not true in all allowed runs, it is not guaranteed by the conditions.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (i.e., event3 at s1)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is, in the next state (s1) C1 is true — equivalently, event3 happens in the state after that (s2). So C2 means event3 at s2 (two steps ahead).

Step 2 — Understand the conditions and assign states
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" ⇒ at s1: event1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" ⇒ for s2 and later: no events occur.
- ""After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event3 never occurs in the reachable sequence given the other rules.

Step 3 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event3 at s1): impossible, because s1 must be event1. So C1 is false.
- C2 (event3 at s2): impossible, because after event1 no further events can occur, so s2 cannot contain event3. So C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis says
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" (At current state s0, C1 asserts event3 at s1.)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (At s0, C2 asserts that at s1 the statement C1 is true — i.e., event3 happens at s2.)

Step 2 — use the conditions
- Initially (s0) event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So at s1 event1 occurs.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So at s2 and later no events (no event1/2/3) can occur.
- (The condition about event3 → event1 or event2 is irrelevant because event3 never gets to occur given the earlier constraints.)

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 requires event3 to occur at s2. But since s1 is event1 and after event1 no events can happen, event3 cannot occur at s2.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event3 happens in that state's next state (two steps ahead from the current state).

Step 2 — apply the conditions
- Initially event2 happened (current state s0).
- After event2, event1 must happen → in the next state s1, event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen → s1 has no successor state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 at s0 (""event3 happens in the next state"") is false because the next state s1 has event1, not event3.
- C2 at s0 (""C1 holds in the next state"") requires that C1 be true in s1. But s1 has no next state, so C1 is false in s1 as well.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the statements:
   - C1: ""Event3 always happens"" = at every state from now on, event3 occurs.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = starting at the next state, event3 will hold at every future state.

2. Use the given rules and the initial condition:
   - Initially (state s0): event2 happened.
   - After event2 (i.e., at s1), the system must go to either event1 or event3.

3. Show a counterexample to C2:
   - If s1 = event1 (allowed by the rule after event2), then at s1 event3 is not true. So C1 (""event3 always happens"") does not hold at s1.
   - Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false — there is at least one permitted next state where C1 fails.

4. Even if s1 = event3, the rules permit s2 to be event1 or event2, so “event3 always” would still not be guaranteed from s1.

Hence C2 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpretations:
- C1 says ""event3 always happens"" (i.e., in every state from now on event3 holds).
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" — equivalently: in the immediate successor state, it will be true that event3 holds in all future states from that successor.

2. Use the context rules:
- Initially event2 occurred.
- From event2 the next event must be either event1 or event3.
- From event1 the next must be event2.
- From event3 the next must be either event1 or event2.

3. Show why C2 is false by counterexample(s):
- If the next state after the initial event2 is event1 (allowed), then after that event1 forces event2, so event3 does not necessarily (and need not) occur — so ""event3 always happens"" is false in that next state.
- Even if the next state were event3, from event3 the next could be event1 or event2, so event3 is not guaranteed to hold in all future states from that successor either.

Therefore C1 does not hold in the next state, so C2 is False.
---
First identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" — interpreted as: at every future state (globally), event3 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. starting from the immediate successor state, event3 holds at every future state.

Examine the constraints and trace possibilities:
1. Initially event2 happened (so at the current state, event3 is already not happening).
2. After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
   - If the next event is event3, then by the rule ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen,"" the following state cannot be event3. So you cannot have event3 at every step after that.
   - If the next event is event1, then by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" the following state is event2, so again event3 does not occur at every step.
3. In all possible continuations, there is always a successor state after a state with event3 that is not event3, and there are also states (the initial one, or ones following event1) that are not event3. Therefore it is impossible that ""event3 always happens"" from any state (including the next state).

C2 is False."

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace consequences:
Because event1 already happened initially and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" applies, no further events (including event2) can ever occur in this run. Therefore event2 does not eventually happen in the actual execution.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is false in this situation.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") therefore is false.

We need to decide whether ""C1 always holds"" is true given the context.

1. Context facts:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen; after event3 no other events can happen.)

2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
Given that event1 has already happened and no other events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur. So C1 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false in the actual run, the claim that C1 always holds is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., it is always true that event2 will eventually happen).

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- The other lines (""After event2, no other events..."" and ""After event3, no other events..."") are irrelevant here because event1 already happened initially.

Step 3 — reason about event sequences
- Because event1 has already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false in the actual scenario.

Step 4 — evaluate C2
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds. But C1 is false (event2 does not eventually happen), so C2 is false.

- Context facts: ""Initially, event3 happened."" and ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Also ""After event1, event3 must happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen.""

Step 3 — trace possible events:
- Because event3 happened initially and after event3 nothing else can happen, there is no occurrence of event1 at any time (no prior events are stated; ""initially"" means event3 is the starting event).
- Nothing in the context forces event1 to have occurred. C1 being a tautology does not cause event1 to happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C1 is true, so C2 (C1 -> event1) is true only if event1 is true. But event1 does not occur in the given context.
- Therefore C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify the hypothesis:
- C1: (event3 → event3).
- C2: (C1 → event1).
We must decide whether C2 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the context:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (so the run ends once event3 occurs).
- After event1, event3 must happen. (Irrelevant if event1 never occurs.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — Evaluate C1:
- C1 is a tautology (if event3 then event3), so C1 holds (true).

Step 4 — Evaluate C2:
- C2 asserts: if C1 holds, then event1 happens.
- The antecedent (C1 holds) is true, so for C2 to be true the consequent (event1 happens) must be true.
- But from the context: event3 happens initially and after event3 no other events can happen, so no further events (including event1) can occur. Thus event1 does not happen.

Conclusion:
- Antecedent true, consequent false ⇒ the implication C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the claim ""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"" (i.e. event3 → event3).
- C2 is the claim ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" (i.e. (event3 → event3) → event1).
You are asking whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (so event3 is terminal).
- After event1, event3 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event3 must occur afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event3 happened initially and after event3 no other events can happen, no events can occur after that initial event3. Therefore event1 cannot occur at any point (it cannot occur before the initial event3, because the initial state already has event3 having happened).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event3 → event3) is a tautology and is true in this context.
- C2 asserts that if C1 holds then event1 happens. Since C1 does hold but event1 does not (event1 cannot occur given the initial terminal event3), the implication C1 → event1 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1: ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., event3 must occur in every possible run / is inevitable).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" — so C2 is true only if event3 is inevitable (C1) and an occurrence of event3 also happens.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially: event2 occurs.
- After event2: next must be either event1 or event3.
- After event1: next must be either event2 or event3.
- After event3: next must be event2.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- From the initial event2, one allowed continuation is event1 (not event3). From that event1, one allowed continuation is event2. Repeating that choice gives the infinite sequence: 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, ...
- This sequence satisfies all rules (after each 2 we pick 1, after each 1 we pick 2), and event3 never occurs.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because there exists a valid run with no event3, event3 is not guaranteed to always happen; C1 is false. Therefore C2 (which requires C1) is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Hypothesis C2 asserts both that C1 holds and that event3 happens. C1 states ""Event3 always happens.""

2. From the context:
   - Initially event2 occurs.
   - After event2, the next event must be either event1 or event3.
   - After event1, the next event must be either event2 or event3.
   - After event3, the next event must be event2.

3. Starting from the initial event2, one possible allowed sequence is: 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → ... . Each step obeys the rules (after 2 → 1 is allowed; after 1 → 2 is allowed). This infinite alternation never produces event3.

4. Because there exists an allowed execution in which event3 never occurs, C1 (""Event3 always happens"") is false. Therefore C2 (which requires C1 to hold and event3 to happen) is also false.

So the correct final answer is: False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happens.
- From event2 the rules allow either event1 or event3 next.
- From event1 the rules allow either event2 or event3 next.
- Therefore the infinite sequence 2,1,2,1,2,1,... is allowed by the rules and contains no event3 at any point.
- That shows ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) is false, and hence ""C1 holds and event3 happens"" (C2) is also false."

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., Event1 never happens at any time).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So at the initial moment, Event1 does happen.)
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — trace and reason:
- The initial condition already asserts that event1 happened at the start. That directly contradicts C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") at the initial time.
- Since C1 is false at the initial moment, it cannot ""always hold."" No further sequence reasoning is necessary—the initial fact suffices to refute C2.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is true.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event3 happens and C1 holds"" (so C2 requires both event3 happens and event2 does not happen).

Step 3 — use the context rules
- Initially, event2 happened. Therefore the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is already false.
- From the rules: after event2, event3 must happen. Since event2 did happen, event3 must happen. Also after event3, event2 must happen, so events alternate — but crucially event2 does happen (it already did initially and will again).

Step 4 — conclude about C2
- Although event3 does happen, C1 is false (event2 does happen). Since C2 requires C1 to hold, C2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (""Event3 happens and C1 holds"") is true given the context.
- C1 is ""Event2 does not happen."" So C2 requires both: (a) Event3 happens, and (b) Event2 does not happen.

Step 2 — examine given conditions
- Initially, event2 happened. That already falsifies C1 (which asserts event2 does not happen).
- The rules: after event2 → event3 must happen; after event3 → event2 must happen. These force an alternation: once event2 occurs, event3 must occur next, then event2 again, etc.

Step 3 — trace implications
- Because event2 happened initially, event3 will happen (by the rule), and then event2 will happen again, and so on. So event2 does happen (indeed repeatedly).

Step 4 — conclusion about C2
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false because event2 did happen initially (and continues to occur).
- Even though event3 does happen, C2 requires C1 to hold as well. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: Event3 happens and C1 holds (i.e., Event3 happens AND Event2 does not happen).
We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the given conditions:
- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 does happen at least initially.)
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the event sequence implied:
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to happen.
- After that event3, the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to happen again.
- That in turn forces event3 again, and the alternation continues. In any case, event2 does occur (initially and subsequently).

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 asserts ""Event2 does not happen,"" which contradicts the given fact that event2 happened initially. Thus C1 is false.
- C2 requires both ""Event3 happens"" (which is true) and C1 (which is false). Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C1 is the proposition ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds (i.e., at all times/for every event, either Event1 or Event2 happens).
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context rules
- Initially Event3 occurred.
- After Event3, Event2 must happen.
- After Event2, Event3 must happen.
- After Event1, Event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace the forced sequence
- From the initial Event3, the rules force Event2 next, then Event3, then Event2, etc. So the system cycles: ... Event3, Event2, Event3, Event2, ...
- Event1 is never forced and no rule introduces Event1, so Event1 need not ever occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 or Event2 happens"") is false at times when Event3 occurs (neither Event1 nor Event2 occurs during those events).
- Therefore C1 does not hold at all times, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event3 has occurred.
- The rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 to occur (at least once) after that initial event3.
- Once event2 occurs, ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 again, which in turn forces event2 again, producing an ongoing alternation of event3 and event2.
- Therefore event2 does occur (indeed, infinitely often) in every execution. That makes C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") true, because event2 occurs.
- Since this is guaranteed for every reachable execution and at every point forward (event2 will still be produced by the obligations), C1 holds always.

Thus C2 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C1 states: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" (i.e. at a given point, either event1 or event2 occurs).  
C2 states: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. at every point in the run, either event1 or event2 is happening). The question: is C2 true or false?

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event1, event3 must happen (but nothing forces event1 to ever occur).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence:
From the initial event3 we are forced into an alternating sequence: event3, event2, event3, event2, ... Event1 never needs to occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
At the initial moment event3 occurs. At that moment neither event1 nor event2 occurs, so C1 is false there. Also at every occurrence of event3 in the alternating sequence C1 is false. Therefore C1 does not hold at all points, so ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., C1 is true in all cases / at all times).

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Means once event2 has occurred, there are no subsequent events (so nothing can occur in the next state).
- (The facts about event1 and event3 similarly say that after those events nothing can happen, but the crucial one is after event2.)

Step 3 — reason about C1:
- Since initially event2 happened, the ""next state"" is the state after event2.
- But after event2 no other events can happen, so event3 cannot happen in that next state.
- Therefore C1 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- C2 asserts that C1 always holds. Because C1 is already false in the initial/next-state situation, C2 cannot be true.

- Also after event1 and after event3 no other events can happen, but those are irrelevant because event2 is the initial event.

Step 3 — reason about C1 and C2:
- In the initial state (where event2 happened) there is no next state, so event3 cannot occur in the next state. Under standard semantics, ""next"" is false when there is no successor.

Sample responses:
First identify the question: C2 asserts that C1 (""Event1 happens or event2 happens"") always holds. We must decide if C2 is true given the conditions.

Examine the conditions step by step:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen (the system is terminal at event3).
- The other rules (what happens after event1 or event2) are irrelevant because those events never occur from the initial state.

Because the initial (and only reachable) state is that event3 happened and no further events can occur, neither event1 nor event2 ever happens. Thus C1 is false in that state, and therefore C1 does not always hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C2 asserts that C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") always holds.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happens.
- After event3, no other events can happen (terminal state).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Because event3 happens initially and no further events can occur, neither event1 nor event2 ever happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis:
- C1 is false (neither event1 nor event2 happens).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event1 happens or Event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state/time point, C1 is true).

Step 2 — examine the given conditions
- Initially, Event3 happened.
- After Event3, no other events can happen (the statement is repeated).
- The rules after Event1 or Event2 only matter if those events can occur, but they cannot occur after Event3 because Event3 ends the sequence.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- The initial (and only) sequence allowed is: [Event3]. No further events are possible.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- In the sequence [Event3], neither Event1 nor Event2 happens, so C1 is false in that sequence.
- Because there exists a reachable sequence where C1 is false, C1 does not ""always hold.""

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (so C2 says C1 is true in all runs).

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequence(s):
- The system starts with event3 having happened.
- Because after event3 no other events can happen, no subsequent events (including event2) can occur.
- There is no indication event2 occurred before the initial event3, so there is at least one run where event2 does not happen.

Step 4 — conclude:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false (counterexample: the run starting with event3 where no further events occur).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., it is always true that event2 always happens).

Step 2 — understand the conditions:
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules: after event1 → event2 must happen; after event2 → no other events — these only apply if event1 or event2 ever occur.)

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Because event3 happened initially and after event3 no further events can happen, the only possible trace is: event3 and then termination. No event1 or event2 can occur in that trace.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because in the actual trace event2 does not happen.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"".
- C1 says ""Event2 always happens"".
So C2 asserts that, in all executions given the context, event2 always happens.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — Trace the possible execution(s)
- Because event3 happened initially and after event3 no other events can happen, the execution ends immediately after event3.
- In that execution, event2 does not happen.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false (there exists an allowed execution where event2 does not happen).

Step 4 — Conclusion about C2
- C2 asserts C1 always holds. But C1 is already false in the given context, so C2 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and C1.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 occurs at the start.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, event1 must follow.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Event3 is also terminal.)

Examine C1:
- C1: Event1 always happens. Given the context explicitly says event1 happened initially, C1 holds (event1 does occur).

Now, given C1 (event1 occurs initially and is terminal), can event2 happen?
- Event2 cannot occur before the initial event1 (because event1 already happened initially).
- Event2 cannot occur after event1 because ""after event1, no other events can happen.""
- So event2 cannot occur at any time under the given context.

Therefore, the antecedent of C2 (C1) is true but the consequent (event2 happens) is false. The implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 asserts: ""If C1 holds (i.e. event1 always happens), then event2 happens."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences
- Because event1 happens initially, the first (and immediate) event is event1.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events can occur after that initial event1. So the only event that actually occurs is the initial event1.
- Therefore event2 (and event3) cannot occur in any run under these conditions.

Step 4 — evaluate the implication
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is satisfied (event1 does occur initially).
- But event2 does not occur in any run.
- The implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" therefore fails: C1 is true while event2 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether the conditional C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event1 happened. So in every run under the given description, event1 has already occurred at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So any occurrence of event1 is terminal: no event (including event2) can occur after it.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" only constrains what must follow event2, but it does not allow event2 to occur before a terminal event1 that already happened initially.
- After event3, no other events can happen (not used further here).

Step 3 — trace the possible sequences
Because event1 happened initially and is terminal, no other events can ever occur in any execution. In particular, event2 cannot occur.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") holds (event1 occurred initially in every execution).
- C2 claims: if C1 holds, then event2 happens. But in the model event2 cannot happen (event1 already prevents any further events). So the antecedent of the implication is true but the consequent is false, making the implication false.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C2 is the statement ""Event2 happens in the next state OR event1 happens.""

Step 2 — apply the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen → event1 will occur next.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing can occur after that).

Step 3 — conclude:
- Because event1 must happen (in the next state), the disjunction in C2 is satisfied regardless of whether event2 happens. (In fact, event2 does not happen in the next state, because event1 must occur then and no other events can occur after event1.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis:
- C1: event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen — so the next state after the initial one is event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen (terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here).

Step 3 — reason about sequences:
- Since event3 occurred initially and event1 must happen after event3, the next state is event1. Therefore event2 cannot happen in the next state, so C1 is false.
- However, event1 does happen in the next state, so the disjunction ""C1 or event1 happens"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens.""

We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one must have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — trace possible next state:
- Since initially event3 occurred and ""after event3, event1 must happen,"" the next state must have event1.
- Therefore event2 does not happen in the next state, so C1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Even though C1 is false, event1 does happen in the next state, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True"
