- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. Therefore, from the initial state, event3 will always occur immediately after event2. This means that C1 (event3 eventually happens) is always true from the initial state.
- Since C1 is always true, C2 (event1 happens or C1 holds) is always true regardless of whether event1 happens or not.

From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.

Consider the possible sequences:

- The initial state has event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so the system transitions to event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so the system remains at event1 indefinitely.
- After event3, no other events can happen, but event3 never occurs in any state because there is no transition to event3 from event1 or event2.

C1 is defined as ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens."" This means that in any state where event3 is true, event2 must also be true in that state. However, since only one event can be true per state, event2 and event3 cannot both be true simultaneously. Therefore, if event3 were true, C1 would be false.

- If the system transitions from event3 to event1, then event1 has occurred. From event1, if it transitions to event2, then event1 must occur again after event2. If it transitions to event3, then from event3, it will eventually transition to event1 or event2, both of which lead to event1.

- The system starts with event2.
- From event2, the system can go to event1 or event3.
- From event1, it must go to event3.
- From event3, it must go to event2.

This means that event3 occurs only in some states, not in all states. For example:
- If the sequence is event2 → event1 → event3 → event2, event3 occurs only after event1.
- If the sequence is event2 → event3 → event2, event3 occurs only between event2 states.

In no sequence does event3 always happen because after event3, event2 must happen, so event3 is not continuously true. Therefore, C1 is false.

- Initially, event1 happened. In this state, event1 is true, but event2 is not true. Therefore, C1 is false in the initial state because the implication ""event1 implies event2"" requires event2 to be true when event1 is true, which is not the case.
- After event1, no other events can happen, meaning the system remains in a state where event1 is true indefinitely. Thus, in every state, event1 is true and event2 is false, so C1 is always false.

Since C1 is false in every state, C2 (which requires C1 to always hold) is false.

- The system starts with event1.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event1 must happen.

C1 requires that event2 always happens from some state onward. However, due to the rules, event2 cannot always happen because after event2, event3 must occur, and after event3, event1 must occur. This means event2 cannot occur in every state; it only occurs intermittently in sequences that include event2, or not at all in sequences that always choose event3 after event1.

Therefore, C1 is false at every state. Since C1 never holds, C2 cannot be true because it requires both event1 to happen and C1 to hold. Event1 does happen (initially and periodically), but C1 never holds.

Thus, C2 is false.

The initial state is Event1. According to the transitions, after Event1, Event3 must happen. Therefore, from the initial state, the next state is Event3, where Event1 does not happen. Thus, C1 does not hold in the next state, meaning C2 is false from the initial state.

From the initial state (event1), the possible sequences are:
- After event1, either event2 or event3 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.

In any sequence, there are states where event1 or event3 is true, and event2 is false. For example:
- If the sequence goes from event1 to event2, event2 is true in that state, but then it goes to event1 where event2 is false.
- If the sequence goes from event1 to event3, event2 is false until it goes to event2 from event3.

- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so the next state after initial is event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so the system remains in event1 indefinitely.
- Event3 never occurs in this sequence because the system transitions from event2 to event1 and stays there.

Now, evaluating C2 at the initial state:
- C2 at the initial state requires that C1 holds in the next state (i.e., at state S1).
- C1 at state S1 requires that event3 happens in the next state (i.e., at state S2).
- However, at state S2, event1 happens, not event3. Therefore, C1 is false at state S1.
- Since C1 is false at state S1, C2 is false at the initial state.

Additionally, since event3 never occurs, C1 is always false, and thus C2 is always false.

Therefore, C2 is false.
