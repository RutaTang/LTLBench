- After event3, event1 must happen → S1: event1.
- After event1, event2 must happen → S2: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → S3: event1, and then S4: event2, etc.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 at states:
- At S0: next state is S1 (event1) ⇒ C1 false.
- At S1: next state is S2 (event2) ⇒ C1 true.
Thus C1 holds at S1 (and again at every state just before an event2).

1. C1 says ""Event3 eventually happens"" (i.e., from the current state, at some future state event3 occurs).
2. Start: initially event1 happened. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
   - If event3 happens immediately next, C1 is true at the initial state.
   - If event2 happens next, the context requires that after event2, event3 must happen — so event3 happens at the next step after that, and C1 is still true at the initial state.
3. Therefore in every possible continuation from the initial state, event3 does occur; C1 holds at the initial state.
4. C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future state where C1 is true). Since C1 already holds at the initial state, C2 is true (and note FFp is equivalent to Fp, so nesting eventualities doesn't change this).

1. C1 states: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., event2 holds in all states).
2. The context says: ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen.""
3. Therefore, the system starts in a state where event1 is true and stays there forever (no transition to a state where event2 could occur).
4. Hence event2 does not hold in the initial (or any) state of the only possible trace.

1. Clarify the formulas:
   - C1: event2 AND event1 (both in the same state).
   - C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., event1 -> (event2 AND event1)), which is equivalent to event1 -> event2 (but still requires event2 in the same state as event1).

2. Implicit model assumption (as in the examples): in any single state exactly one event holds (events are mutually exclusive).

3. From the context:
   - Initially event2.
   - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen. Therefore there is a reachable next state where event1 happens.

4. In a state where event1 happens, because events are mutually exclusive, event2 does not hold in that same state. So C1 (event1 AND event2) is false in that state.

5. Thus there exists a reachable state where event1 is true but C1 is false, so the implication (C2) fails in that state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen. Thus the system cycles 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 ... (event3 is never forced and is irrelevant here).

2. C1 is the state formula ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"", i.e. event2 → event1. In any state with event1 true the implication holds; in a state with event2 true the implication fails.

3. Since the initial state is event1, C1 already holds in the initial state (and in every event1 state that recurs).

4. Therefore C1 holds at some (in fact the initial) state, so ""C1 eventually holds"" is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event2 holds.
2. From the rules: after event2, event3 must happen; after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen; after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. Thus the system moves between states where exactly one of the events holds at a time.
3. C1 requires a single state in which both event2 and event1 hold simultaneously.
4. Given the model (one event per state), no state can have both event2 and event1 true at the same time, so C1 is false in every state.
5. Therefore C2 (the negation of C1) is true."

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to simply ""Event2 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).

3. Context: Initially event2 happened. The context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" which means the next state must again be event2 (it stays at event2).

1. Initially event3 is true.
2. The rules force an alternation: after event3 must come event2, and after event2 must come event3. So the execution cycles between event3 and event2 forever.
3. There is no rule that allows event1 to occur from either event3 or event2, so event1 never occurs in any reachable state.
4. C1 is the state formula ""if event1 happens, then event3 happens"" (event1 → event3). In any state where event1 is false this implication is vacuously true.

- C1: ""Event3 eventually happens"" (from a given state there is some future state where event3 holds).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (in every reachable state, C1 is true).

Step 2 — use the context rules and initial state:
- Initially event2 holds.
- From event2, event3 must happen next.
- From event3, event2 must happen next.
- From event1, next must be event2 or event3 (irrelevant here because event1 never appears).
- There is therefore a single possible infinite trace: event2, event3, event2, event3, ... (alternation forever).

Step 3 — check C1 at every state:
- At any state where event2 holds, event3 holds in the next state, so ""event3 eventually happens"" is true.
- At any state where event3 holds, event3 either holds now (so eventually true) or will occur again after one step (since sequence alternates), so ""event3 eventually happens"" is also true.

Step 4 — conclude about C2:
- Because C1 holds at every reachable state in the only execution, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is True.

1. From the context: initial state = event1. Transitions required:
   - After event1 → event2 (next state must be event2)
   - After event2 → event3
   - After event3 → event2
   So the run is: event1 (initial), then event2, then event3, then event2, then event3, … (a 2↔3 cycle after the initial event1).

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event3 happens."" Interpreting this in the natural temporal sense used by the context (""after event2, event3 must happen""), C1 is true (every time event2 occurs the next state is event3).

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 does hold (see above), and event1 is true in the initial state. Therefore the implication C1 → event1 is true.

3. So C2 is ""eventually (Event1 eventually happens)"". In temporal logic, eventually(eventually P) is equivalent to eventually P, so C2 is equivalent to ""Event1 eventually happens"" (i.e., equivalent to C1).
4. Context rules: initially event2. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. (The rule after event3 is irrelevant because event3 never occurs under these rules.)
5. From the initial state (event2), the next state must be event1. Thus event1 does happen (in the next state), so ""Event1 eventually happens"" is true.

1. C1 is ""Event3 happens and event1 happens"" — a conjunction that requires both event3 and event1 to be true in the same state.  
2. As in the model used in the examples, each state records which single event happened; two different events cannot be true simultaneously in one state.  
3. The context gives the deterministic/required transitions: starting at event2, the run proceeds 2 → 3 → 1 → (2 or 3) → …, so states are labelled by exactly one event at a time (2, then 3, then 1, ...). At no state are event1 and event3 both true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. C1 is the statement ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., event3 never occurs).
2. C2 is the implication ""If event3 happens, then C1 holds"" — equivalently: if event3 occurs then event3 never occurs.
3. Start from the initial condition: event1 happened.
4. From event1, the context requires that either event2 or event3 must happen next.
5. Therefore there is a possible execution where event3 happens immediately after event1.
6. In that execution the antecedent of C2 (""event3 happens"") is true, but the consequent C1 (""event3 does not happen"") is false.
7. So C2 is false in that execution.

- C1 at a state means ""event2 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at that state's successor).
- C2 at a state means ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at the successor state, event2 holds in its successor — equivalently, event2 holds two steps ahead).

Evaluate at the initial state s0:
- C1 at s0? Look at s1: s1 has event3, not event2 → C1 is false at s0.
- C2 at s0? Look at s1: at s1 the next state s2 has event2, so C1 is true at s1 → therefore C2 is true at s0.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event3 is true. After event3 either event1 or event2 must occur, so C1 (event1 in the next state) can hold by choosing event1 next.
- But after event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen, so the system then alternates between event1 and event2 forever and never returns to event3.
- Thus there is an execution where C1 holds but event3 never happens afterward, so ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" is not universally true."

1. C1 is the formula ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (event2 -> event2). This is a logical tautology, so C1 holds in every state (true whether event2 is true or false).

2. C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" (C1 -> event2). Since C1 holds in every state, C2 reduces to requiring event2 to hold in every state.

3. But the system does not have event2 in every state. From the context: initially event2, and after event2 event3 must happen. So the next state is event3 (where event2 is false). In that state C1 is still true (tautology) but event2 is false, so C2 is false there.

4. Therefore C2 is not true in all states (it is false).

1. Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event3 happens in the next state"". C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from the current state, C2 asserts that at time+1, C1 is true (so event3 will occur at time+2).

2. Context / transition rules:
   - Initially event1 holds (time 0).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (time 1).
   - After event2, event3 must happen (time 2).
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (time 3), etc.

3. Evaluate C2 at the initial state (time 0):
   - The next state (time 1) is event2 (by rule after event1).
   - At time 1, C1 says ""event3 happens in the next state"" — and indeed after event2, event3 must happen, so event3 will hold at time 2.
   - Therefore C1 is true at time 1, so C2 is true at time 0.

1. C1 is ""Event3 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event3 in a given state).  
2. C2 is ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — equivalently: event2 → ¬event3.  
3. That formula is logically equivalent to ¬(event2 ∧ event3): it fails only if both event2 and event3 are true in the same state.

System rules recap:
- Initially event2 is true.
- From event2 the next state must be either event1 or event3.
- From event1 the next state must be event2.
- From event3 the next state must be event2.

C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""

Reasoning:
1. If C1 is false (event1 never happens), then the implication C1 → event2 is vacuously true.
2. If C1 is true (event1 does happen at some future time), then by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" there is a state immediately after that event1 state where event2 holds. So event2 does happen (in the future).
3. Also note event2 is true in the initial state regardless.

Thus under any interpretation (whether the consequence is taken to mean event2 holds now or that event2 will happen at some time), the implication is satisfied. Therefore C2 is True.

4. C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state — i.e., in the state immediately following the initial one, event2 does not happen.

1. Context facts:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so once in an event2 state the system stays at event2 (the next state also has event2).
- The other rules (after event1 → event3; after event3 → event1) are irrelevant because event1 and event3 never occur starting from event2 given the ""no other events"" clause.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From the context, whenever the current state has event2, the next state also has event2. So C1 holds in any state where event2 holds.

3. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Given the above, there is no state where event2 holds and the next state does not have event2. Therefore the implication is always satisfied.

   - From event1 → event2 or event3.
   - From event2 → event1.

3. Check every possible current state:
   - If the current state is event1: event1 already holds now, so ""event1 eventually happens"" is true.
   - If the current state is event2: next state must be event1, so event1 will happen immediately → C1 true.
   - If the current state is event3: next state is either event1 (so C1 true immediately) or event2, and from event2 next is event1 (so within two steps event1 happens) → C1 true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 is ""Event3 always happens"" (i.e., event3 holds in every state).
2. The context says the initial state has event1. Therefore event3 does not hold in the initial state, so C1 is false in every trace of the system.
3. C2 is the implication (C1 → event2). An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously).
4. Since C1 cannot hold, C2 is true in the given context."

1. Translate the context into reachable states and transitions:
   - Initial state: event2 is true.
   - From event2, event1 must happen next (2 -> 1).
   - From event1, no other events can happen (so it stays at event1 forever).
   - From event3, event2 must happen (3 -> 2). But event3 is not reachable from the initial state given the other rules.

2. Understand C1 and C2:
   - C1: ""If event3 happens, then event1 happens."" As a state formula this is (event3 -> event1). This is true in any state where event3 is false (vacuously true) or where both event3 and event1 are true.
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e., there is some (future) state where C1 is true.

3. Evaluate along the actual execution from the initial state:
   - Initial state: event2. In that state event3 is false, so C1 holds vacuously.
   - Next and all future states: the system moves to event1 and stays at event1; in those states event3 is false, so C1 also holds.

4. Conclusion:
   - C1 already holds at the initial state (and in all reachable future states), so C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true.

   - After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal — it repeats forever).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here unless event1 occurs).

3. Evaluate C1 at that next state (event1): event1 is true in that state, so the implication (not event3) or event1 is true there (the consequent event1 is true).
4. Therefore C1 holds in the next state, so C2 is True.

1. C1 is the conjunction ""Event3 happens and Event2 happens"" (i.e., both are true in the same state).
2. Initially event1 is true, so at the initial state C1 is false.
3. From the rules: after event1 → event3; after event3 → either event1 or event2; after event2 → event3. These transitions imply exactly one event holds in each state (events alternate).

   - At event1, the next state is event3, so C1 is true there.
   - At event3, the next state is event1, so C1 is false there.

3. C2: ""Event3 happens (now) and C1 holds (i.e., event3 in the next state).""
   - At event2: event3 is not happening now → C2 false.
   - At event1: event3 is not happening now → C2 false.
   - At event3: event3 is happening now, but C1 is false because the next state is event1 → C2 false.

4. No state satisfies both event3 now and event3 in the next state. Therefore C2 never holds.

3. C1 is the state formula (event1 → event2): whenever event1 holds in a state, event2 must also hold in that same state.
4. In the initial state event1 is true, but event2 is false (only one event holds per state), so the implication event1 → event2 is false in the initial state.

1. The system starts with event3 (initial state = event3).
2. Transition rules:
   - After event3, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, event3 must happen.
   - (After event1 → event3, but event1 is not reachable from the given rules.)
3. Therefore the only reachable sequence is an infinite alternation: event3, event2, event3, event2, ...
4. C1 = (event2 OR event3). In every reachable state either event2 or event3 holds, so C1 is true in all reachable states.
5. C2 = (C1 AND event2). That reduces to just event2 (since C1 is true whenever event2 holds). So C2 is true exactly in the states where event2 is the current event, and false in states where event3 holds.
6. The initial state is event3, so C2 is false in the initial state.

If the question asks whether C2 holds in the initial state (the usual reading), the answer is: False.

1. Interpret the context as a state-transition graph with exclusive events (one event true per state):
   - Initial state: event2.
   - From event1 → next state must be event2 or event3.
   - From event2 → next state must be event1.
   - From event3 → next state must be event2.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" means event1 holds in every state (globally). C2: ""C1 always holds"" is equivalent to saying C1 holds in every state — same requirement.

3. Starting from the initial state we have event2 (so event1 is already false at time 0). Even looking at possible infinite runs:
   - One possible run: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (alternating). Many states are event2, so event1 is not true everywhere.
   - Another run: event2, event1, event3, event2, event1, ... (event3 appears too). Again, not all states are event1.

4. Because the initial state is event2 (not event1) and future states can be event2 or event3, event1 does not hold in every state. Thus C1 is false, and therefore C2 is false.

- After event3, the next state is event1 or event2 (doesn't prevent event3 after an occurrence of event1).

2. From the context: initially event1. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...
3. In any state where event2 holds, event1 does not hold (exactly one event holds per state). Thus in those states the implication event2 ⇒ event1 is false.
4. Because event2 does occur (immediately after the initial state), there are states where C1 is false.
5. Therefore C1 does not always hold, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is False.

1. C1 is the formula ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (event2 -> event2).  
2. Any formula of the form p -> p is a tautology, so C1 is true in every state (in particular it holds in the initial state).  
3. C2 is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" (C1 -> event1). Since C1 holds, C2 reduces to requiring event1 to hold.  
4. From the context: the initial state has event3, and after event3 no other events can happen. Thus event1 never occurs (neither initially nor later).

1. C2 is the state-level implication: if event1 holds in a state, then C1 holds in that same state. C1 is the proposition (event2 or event3) in that state.  
2. The context says: ""Initially, event1 happened."" It does not say event2 or event3 also hold in that same initial state. (Only one event holds in a state.)  
3. So in the initial state event1 is true but event2 and event3 are false, hence C1 is false in that state.  
4. Therefore the implication (event1 -> C1) is false in the initial state (true implies false).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event3 is true.
2. The rules force the sequence: after event3 → event2, after event2 → event3, so the system alternates 3,2,3,2,... forever. Event1 never occurs (no rule leads to event1).
3. Only one event holds in any single state, so event2 and event3 cannot both be true simultaneously in one state.

1. Initial state: event1 is true.
2. After event1, event3 must happen. So the next state (state1) is event3.
3. After event3, event2 must happen. So the state after that (state2) is event2.
4. After event2, event1 must happen, and the cycle repeats: event1 -> event3 -> event2 -> ...

Now evaluate the hypothesis formulas at the initial state:
- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state."" At the initial state, the next state is state1, which is event3, so C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That means: at state1, is C1 true? C1 at state1 asserts that state1's next state (state2) is event3. But state2 is event2 (per the sequence), so C1 is false at state1. Therefore C2 is false at the initial state.

2. Initial state: event2 happened.

2. From the context: initially event3 happened, and after event3 no other events can happen. So event1 never happens in any reachable state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret predicates: ""eventX happens"" means X holds in the current state; ""eventually"" means there exists some (current or future) state where the proposition holds.

2. Build the transition relation from the context:
   - Initial state: event2.
   - From event1 → event2.
   - From event2 → event1 or event3.
   - From event3 → event1 or event2.

3. Check C1 (event3 eventually happens) at the initial state:
   - From initial event2 there is a possible next state event3 (because after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen). So there exists a future state where event3 holds. Therefore C1 is true at the initial state.

4. Check C2 (C1 holds and event2 happens) at the initial state:
   - event2 happens in the initial state (given).
   - C1 holds (from step 3).
   - Both conjuncts are satisfied at the initial state, so C2 is true.

Therefore C2 is True."

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. States are such that exactly one event holds at a time (as used in the examples).
2. Initially event1 holds.
3. From the context, after event1, event3 must happen — so the next state is event3.
4. After event3 no other events can happen, so once event3 holds it holds forever.
5. C1 is ""event1 and event3"" — i.e., a single state where both are true simultaneously.
6. Because only one event can be true in any state, there is no state where event1 and event3 are both true. So C1 is false in every state.
7. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 never holds, C2 is false.

3. After event3, event1 must happen — so after that we return to event1.
4. Thus from the initial state the system alternates: event1 → event3 → event1 → event3 → ...
5. There is a rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"", but there is no rule that allows (or forces) a transition into event2 from event1 or event3. Starting from the initial event1, event2 is never reached.

3. Interpret C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This means event2 holds in every state (globally). That is false, because the state after the initial event2 is event3 (so event2 does not hold there). Thus C1 is false.

4. C2 is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does occur in the runs (e.g., after event3), so the first conjunct is true, but C1 is false. A conjunction with a false conjunct is false.

Use the context:
- Initially event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → the next state is event1.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen → the successor of an event1 state is either event2 or event3 (so the very next state after an event1-state is not event1).
- After event3, no other events can happen (if event3 occurs, it stays event3 forever).

Evaluate C2:
- The next state from the initial state is an event1 state. C2 asks whether, from that state onward, event1 is true in every state.
- But from an event1 state the required next state is either event2 or event3, neither of which is event1. Thus event1 cannot hold in every future state starting from that next state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1 says: if event2 happens then event1 happens. This is an implication about the same state (event2 -> event1).
2. The context states ""Initially, event2 happened."" So in the initial state event2 is true.

- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — this asserts that in every state (globally) event1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — this requires both that event2 occurs (at some relevant state) and that C1 is true.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen — so once in the initial state (event3), the system remains at event3 forever; neither event1 nor event2 can occur now or in the future.
- The other rules (after event1 → event3, after event2 → event1 or event3) are irrelevant because event1 and event2 never occur from the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false: the initial state has event1 false, and no future state will have event1 true, so event1 is not true in all states.
- Since C1 is false, C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is false regardless of whether event2 could occur. In fact, event2 also never occurs from the initial state, so both conjuncts fail.

Reasoning:
1. C1 requires that in any state either event1 or event3 holds.
2. Initially event1 holds, so C1 is true at the start.
3. From event1 the system may go to event2 (the rule is ""after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen""), so a state with event2 is reachable.

1. Clarify the formulas:
   - C1 = ""event2 does not happen"" (i.e., ¬event2).
   - C2 = ""event3 happens and C1 holds"" = event3 ∧ ¬event2.
   - Since exactly one event holds in a state, event3 implies ¬event2, so C2 is equivalent to ""event3 happens"" in any state.

2. Use the context rules and initial state:
   - Initially event2 holds.
   - After event2, event3 must happen.
   - After event3, event2 must happen.
   - So the system alternates: event2 (initial) → event3 → event2 → event3 → ...

3. Evaluate C2:
   - C2 is false in the initial state (initially event2, not event3).
   - In the next state event3 holds; there event2 does not hold, so C1 holds and event3 holds, hence C2 holds in that state (and in every event3 state thereafter).

Conclusion: C2 can be true (it holds in the states where event3 occurs). Final answer: True"
