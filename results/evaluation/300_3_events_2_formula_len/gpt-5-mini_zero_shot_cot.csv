- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, the rules require that either event2 or event3 occurs.
  - If event3 occurs there and then, C1 is already false.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") means: at some future moment it becomes true that C1 holds (i.e. F G event3).

From the context:

- After event2, event3 must happen → event3 occurs next.
- After event3, no other events can happen → the system then has no further events.

Consider the timeline: event2 → event3 → termination (no further events). At the initial moment and at the moment after event3, it is not true that event3 holds at every future moment: before event3 occurs it does not hold, and after event3 it cannot continue to happen (there are no further events).

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens."" C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. in the immediate successor state, event2 will eventually happen).

- From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So C1 is true in the initial state (event2 has already happened).

- Also from the context: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes the state reached after event2 terminal — there is no successor state where any events occur.

- Therefore there is no next state after the initial state. In standard temporal semantics the ""next"" operator is false at a terminal state (or undefined but not true). Hence C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false. (Even if one tried to posit a next state, no events can happen after event2, so event2 cannot occur in that future, so C1 would not hold there.)

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is asked: C2 states ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is ""Event3 eventually happens."" So C2 asserts that whenever event2 occurs, event3 will eventually occur.

2. Interpret the conditions:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen. (So any timeline containing event1 must later contain event2.)
   - After event2, event3 must happen. (So any occurrence of event2 is followed by event3 at some later point.)
   - After event3, event1 must happen. (Thus the events form a cycle 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → ...)

3. Trace/reason:
   - Because of the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"", any occurrence of event2 guarantees a subsequent occurrence of event3.
   - Therefore, whenever event2 happens, C1 (""event3 eventually happens"") is satisfied.

Thus C2 is True."

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Other rules: after event2, event3 must happen; after event3, no other events can happen.)

Step 3 — trace possible events
- Because event1 occurred initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no possibility for event2 to occur at any time in this scenario.

- Since event2 cannot occur, it is not true that ""Event2 always happens"" (C1 is false).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event2 happens (given).
2. From ""after event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"": following that initial event2, at least one of event1 or event3 occurs.
3. If event3 occurs, then ""after event3, event1 must happen"", so event1 will occur anyway. Thus in every case event1 occurs.
4. Therefore both event2 (initially) and event1 (as shown) happen — so C1 is true.
5. C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 holds (both events happen), that implication is true. Also, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" directly ensures event1 implies event2, so C1 follows from event1 as well.

- After that, no events occur at any later state.

- Initially, event2 happened. So at the initial moment event2 has occurred, hence C1 is true at that moment (there is a time — now — at which event2 has happened).
- After event2 no other events can happen, so nothing later can change that.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2 asks whether there is some time at which C1 holds. Since C1 already holds at the initial moment, C2 holds (the eventuality can be satisfied by the current time).

- After event1 → event2.
- After event2 → event1.

Trace the event sequence
- From the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2 → event1"", event1 must occur.
- From event1 and ""after event1 → event2"", event2 must occur.
- From event2 again event1 must occur, and so on. So event1 and event2 alternate indefinitely; event1 does indeed occur repeatedly (C1 can hold).

Does C1 imply event3?
- There is no rule that produces event3 or that connects event1 (or event2) to event3. The only link involving event3 is event3 → event1, which does not force event3 to occur.
- Therefore, even if event1 always happens, that does not entail that event3 happens.

- After event3, event2 must happen. (If event3 occurs, event2 must occur after it.)

Step 3 — Reasoning about sequences
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 can never actually occur in any allowed sequence. So the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is impossible under the context.
- Independently, the rule ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen"" explicitly guarantees that if event2 does happen, then event1 or event3 happens afterward — exactly the content of C1.

</graphml>",1,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1 is the formula ""event3 happens and event3 happens."" This is just a conjunction of the same atomic fact with itself, so C1 is equivalent to ""event3 happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds,"" i.e. ""event3 happens eventually.""

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially, event3 happened. So at the initial moment, event3 is true.
- Other rules force that after event3 occurs, event1 must occur; after event1, event2 must occur; after event2, event1 must occur. Those rules make event1 and event2 occur subsequently, but they do not prevent or negate the fact that event3 already happened initially, and they do not require event3 to occur again.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 0: event3 is true, so C1 (equivalent to event3) holds immediately.
- Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is satisfied immediately (it holds at time 0).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Under the natural reading of C1 as simply ""event3 happens,"" C2 is True.

(If one instead interpreted C1 as requiring two distinct occurrences of event3 at different times, there is no rule producing another event3, so under that stronger interpretation C2 would be False. But with the plain reading of the given formula, the correct answer is:)

- These rules may generate further occurrences of event1 and event3, but nothing in the context forces or forbids event2.

Step 3 — examine C1
- C1 is the statement event2 → event2. In standard logic this is a tautology: whenever the antecedent is true the consequent is the same formula and therefore true. Even if event2 never occurs, the implication is vacuously true whenever evaluated.

- After event2, event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- (After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen — this does not force event1 to ever occur.)

Step 3 — trace the possible executions
- Starting from the initial event2, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 next.
- After that, ""after event3, event2 must happen"" forces event2 next.
- Thus the execution alternates event2, event3, event2, event3, ... indefinitely.
- Therefore event3 not only eventually happens, it recurs infinitely often. Even if event1 could occur, its rule still ensures a following event2 or event3, so event3 remains inevitable from appropriate points.

- C1 holds (event3 eventually happens).
- C2 also holds: at every point in the run, event3 will occur eventually (indeed repeatedly).

- After event1, event2 must happen, so event1 and event2 will alternate thereafter.
- The rule about event3 is irrelevant unless event3 occurs.

Step 3 — trace and conclude
- Because event2 occurred initially and ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true.

From ""after event1 → event3"" and ""after event3 → event1"" we get an enforced alternation: once event1 has occurred (it does initially), event3 must follow, then event1, then event3, etc. This produces a valid infinite trace like:
  event1 (initial), event3, event1, event3, event1, ...
No rule forces event2 to ever occur. The clause ""after event2 → (event1 or event3)"" only constrains what must happen if event2 occurs; it does not require event2 to occur.

- After event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- The other rules (after event3 → event1 or event2; after event2 → event1) are irrelevant because no events can follow the initial event1.

1. Identify the hypothesis:

   - C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event3 must occur in the next state).

2. Examine the rules:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so from the initial state: event1 -> next state event2).
   - After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (so after any event2 the next state could be event1 OR event3).
   - After event3, event2 must happen.

3. Trace a possible sequence (counterexample to C2):
   - time0: event1 (given)
   - time1: event2 (forced by after event1)
   - time2: choose event1 (allowed because after event2 either event1 or event3)
   In this trace, event2 happened at time1 but event3 does NOT happen at time2, so C1 fails.

Since there exists a valid sequence where event2 happens but event3 does not occur in the next state, C2 is not guaranteed by the rules.

- After event2, event3 must happen.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state (including possibly the current one) from which the next state has event2.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so the initial state already records an occurrence of event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen — once event2 has occurred, there are no further event transitions (no successor states with events).
- (The other rules about event1 and event3 do not enable any new occurrences because event2 already occurred initially and blocks further events.)

Step 3 — reasoning about sequences
- At the initial state there is no next event-state because ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So C1 is false at the initial state (there is no next state in which event2 happens).
- Because no events can happen after the initial event2, there are no future states at which C1 could become true. Therefore C1 never holds at any future point.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Hypothesis:  
   - C1: ""Event3 eventually happens.""  
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., starting from the successor of the initial state, event3 will eventually happen.

2. From the context: the initial event was event2. The rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces the immediate successor state to be one where event3 has occurred. So the next state is an event3 state.

3. From that next state (where event3 just happened), the rules say ""after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen."" Both choices then force event3 to happen again (after event1, event3 must happen; after event2, event3 must happen). Thus, from the next state, event3 will occur again in the future (indeed within one or two steps).

4. Therefore, starting from the next state, event3 does eventually happen — so C1 holds in that state. Hence C2 is True."

- C1: ""Event3 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., in every state, event3 occurs in the immediately following state.
You are asked whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions
- Initially event3 happened (so the current/initial state S0 has event3).
- After event2 → event1 must happen (if event2 occurs at some state, the next state must have event1).
- After event1 → either event2 or event3 must happen (next state after event1 is event2 or event3).
- After event3 → no other events can happen (event3 is terminal; no events occur after a state with event3).

Step 3 — trace consequences
- At the initial state S0 event3 occurred. By the last condition, no events can happen after event3, so the next state S1 has no events. Therefore event3 does not happen in the next state S1. So C1 is false at the initial state.
- Because C2 requires C1 to hold in every state, and we already have a state (the initial one) where C1 is false, C2 cannot be true.

- Initially event2 happened.

- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event3, no other events can happen.

Trace possible event sequences:
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen, the only possible sequence is: event2 → event1 → stop.
- No other events can occur after event1, so event3 never occurs in any reachable run (and it could not have happened before because event2 was initially true).

Reason about C1 and C2:
- C1 (""if event3 happens then event2 happens"") is vacuously true in every reachable run because event3 never happens — there is no counterexample.

2. From the context we know ""Initially, event2 happened."" That asserts event2 does happen (in the given scenario).
3. A conditional is true whenever the consequent is true. Since event2 does happen (by the context), the implication ""If C1 then event2"" is true regardless of whether C1 can actually hold.
4. (Extra check) C1 actually cannot hold in this scenario because after the initial event2 no further events can occur, so Event3 cannot always happen — but that only reinforces the truth of the implication (either because the consequent is true or because the antecedent is impossible).

- Initially, event2 happened. So C1 already holds at time 0 (because event2 happened).
- After event2, event1 must happen. So even if “eventually” meant strictly later, event1 is guaranteed to occur after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That does not prevent event1 from occurring; it only stops further events after event1.
- The rule about event3 is irrelevant unless event3 happens; it only requires event1 or event2 after event3.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- At time 0: event2 has happened → C1 is true now.
- Also, by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 will occur subsequently, so C1 will also be true later.

- C1 holds immediately and is guaranteed to hold in the future as well. Therefore C2 is True.

- Initially: event2 occurred.
- After event3, event1 must happen (next).
- After event1, event2 must happen (next).
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen (next).

Step 2 — check C1 (event1 eventually happens)
From the initial event2, the next step must be either event1 or event3. If it is event1, event1 has occurred immediately. If it is event3, the rule “after event3, event1 must happen” forces event1 at the following step. Therefore in every possible branch starting from the initial state, event1 will occur (indeed repeatedly). So C1 is true.

Step 3 — check C2 (“C1 holds in the next state”)
We must show that from the state one step after the initial state, event1 will still eventually happen.
- If the next state is event1, then event1 has already occurred there, so “event1 eventually happens” is true at that state.
- If the next state is event3, the rule forces event1 at the following step, so “event1 eventually happens” is true at that state as well.

In both possible next states C1 holds, so C2 is true.

- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., Event1 does not always happen).
You ask whether C2 is True or False.

Step 2 — read the constraints:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So from the initial event2, event3 must occur next.
- After event3, event1 must happen. So after that event3, event1 must occur.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (so the sequence continues, but that doesn't prevent event1 from occurring).

Step 3 — trace the required sequence:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Then event3 (required after event2).
- Then event1 (required after event3).
Thus event1 necessarily occurs. The rules then cycle (after event1 you get event2 or event3, which leads back to event3 then event1), so event1 will continue to occur in every cycle.

Conclusion:
- C1 holds (event1 does always occur under the given constraints).
- Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is False.

C2 is the statement: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 says ""Event2 happens and event3 happens."" So C2 is equivalent to: event2 → (event2 ∧ event3), which reduces to event2 → event3 (since the antecedent already gives event2).

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event1 → event2 (and since event1 happened, event2 will happen).
- After event2, event3 must happen. So event2 → event3.
- After event3, event2 must happen. So event3 → event2.

Step 3 — trace consequences
From initial event1 we get event2. From event2 we get event3. Therefore both event2 and event3 occur (C1 holds). More generally, whenever event2 happens the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" ensures event3 will happen, so event2 implies (event2 and event3).

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Identify the hypothesis: C2 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then event3 happens"" (i.e. C1 → event3).
- Conditions from context:
  - Initially, event3 happened. (So event3 is true in the given scenario.)
  - After event1, event3 must happen.
  - After event3, no other events can happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1 is ""If event3 happens, then event2 happens"" (event3 → event2).

Evaluation:
- C2 is an implication whose consequent is “event3 happens.” The context already states that event3 happened initially. That makes the consequent true independent of whether C1 holds.
- A material implication P → Q is true whenever Q is true (regardless of P). Therefore C2 is true in this situation.

(Notes: C1 may be inconsistent with the “after event3 no other events can happen” constraint depending on timing, but that does not affect the truth of C2 because event3 is already true.)"

- C1: ""Event3 does not happen.""  
- The context states: initially event3 happened. So C1 is already false in the given scenario (event3 has occurred).

C2 asserts: if event2 happens then event3 does not happen. To refute C2 it suffices to exhibit a valid sequence (consistent with the rules) where event2 happens and event3 also happens.

A valid sequence consistent with the rules:
1. Initially: event3 (given).
2. After event3 → choose event2. Sequence so far: event3, event2.
3. After event2 → event1 must happen. Sequence: event3, event2, event1.
4. After event1 → choose event3. Sequence: event3, event2, event1, event3.

This sequence follows all rules and contains both event2 and event3. Thus there is a case where event2 happens while event3 also happens, so the implication ""if event2 happens then event3 does not happen"" is false.

- C2 asserts that C1 is true in the next state. Since after event1 no events can occur in subsequent states, event2 certainly does not happen in the next state either. So C1 still holds in the next state.

- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event3 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible continuations
- From an event3, if event2 happens next then event3 must happen after that (so a new event3 occurs).
- From an event3, if event1 happens next then event2 must follow and then event3 must follow (so again a new event3 occurs).
- Thus every time event3 occurs, the rules force that another event3 will occur later. Starting from the initial event3, this repeats indefinitely.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore event3 will keep occurring forever (it recurs in every possible continuation). So C1 (""Event3 always happens"") holds, and C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.

</graphml>",1,"Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds"", where C1 is ""event1 happens or event3 happens"". So C2 asserts that at some future point (possibly immediately) either event1 or event3 will occur.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- ""After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen."" — this requires that following the initial event2 at least one of event1 or event3 occurs at some future time.
- The other two rules (after event3 → event1, and after event1 → event3) only enforce further occurrences once one of them has happened; they do not prevent the first occurrence required by the event2 rule.

Step 3 — trace the consequences
- Since event2 did happen initially, the rule tied to event2 forces that either event1 or event3 occurs afterward. Thus C1 will hold at some point.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is satisfied.

- C1 is the formula ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e., event2 → event2).
- C2 states ""C1 always holds"" — that C1 is true at every point in every allowed execution.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Initially event3 happened.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, no further events can occur (terminal).

Step 3 — possible event sequences
- From the initial event3 we must next have event2.
- After that we either go to event1 (and stop) or to event3, which forces event2 again, etc.
- So allowed traces look like: 3 → 2 → (1 stops) or 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 3 → 2 → … with a possible eventual 1 to terminate.

Step 4 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true at any state: if event2 happens then (by the same fact) event2 happens.
- Even in states where event2 does not happen, the implication is vacuously true.
- Therefore C1 holds at every point on every allowed trace.

Transition rules (from the problem):
- From 3 → {1, 2}
- From 1 → {2, 3}
- From 2 → {1} (forced)

Reasoning about every possible state:
- If the current state is 2, the next event must be 1. So event1 occurs immediately.
- If the current state is 3, the next event is either 1 (done) or 2, and from 2 the next event is 1. So from 3, event1 occurs within at most 2 steps.
- If the current state is 1, the next event is either 2 or 3. If it is 2 then the following event is 1; if it is 3 then, as just shown, event1 occurs within at most two more steps. So from 1, event1 occurs within at most 2 steps.

Thus from every possible state (1, 2, or 3), event1 is guaranteed to occur within at most two steps. Therefore C1 holds at every state, so C2 (that C1 always holds) is True.

Examine the conditions and possible sequences:
1. Initially event1 happens.
2. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
3. If event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal). In that branch the sequence is event1 → event2, and event3 does not occur (so C1 holds in that run).
4. If event3 happens instead, then by the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"" the sequence is event1 → event3 → event2, and event3 did occur (so C1 is false in that run).

Because both sequences are allowed by the context, there exists a run where event3 occurs (making C1 false) and a run where it does not (making C1 true).

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What the hypothesis asks:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology — whenever event1 holds, it implies itself.
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That means there is some point in the execution (possibly the initial point) where C1 is true.

2. Examine the conditions:
   - Initially, event1 happened. So at time 0 event1 is true.
   - Also, ""after event1, no other events can happen"" ensures the trace ends immediately after that initial event, but that doesn't affect truth of C1 at time 0.

3. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - At the initial moment (where event1 has happened) C1 (""if event1 then event1"") is true.
   - Therefore C1 holds at time 0, so ""eventually C1"" is satisfied (indeed it holds immediately).

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is the formula ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" (event1 → event1). This is a logical tautology and therefore true in any state where it is evaluated.

- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" We evaluate this at the initial state.

- From the context: initially event3 happened; after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. So the immediate next state exists and is either an event1-state or an event2-state.

- In both possibilities C1 (a tautology) is true in that next state. The fact that after event1 no further events can happen only affects successors of that next state, not the truth of C1 in the next state itself.

Therefore C2 is True."

We must decide whether C2 is true.

Step 2 — use the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true (at least once).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. That allows two branches:
  - If event2 happens next, no further events occur (but event1 already happened).
  - If event3 happens next, then event1 must happen afterward, and the process continues.
In every case, event1 does indeed happen (it did initially), so the disjunction in C1 (""event3 or event1"") is satisfied because event1 happened.

Step 3 — conclude:
- C1 is true (because event1 happened).
- ""Event1 happens"" is true.
Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true.

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (if event3 occurs, it is followed by event1 or event2).

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences:
- One valid sequence is: event2 → event1. This respects ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and then stops because event1 is terminal. In this sequence event3 never happens.
- Another valid sequence is: event2 → event3 → event1. This is also allowed. So event3 can happen, but it is not forced.

Examine the context:
1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. After event1, no other events can happen. (So no event can occur at any time after the initial event1.)
3. After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 ever occurs, it requires a later occurrence of event1.)
4. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen. (If event3 ever occurs, it requires a later event1 or event2.)

Reasoning:
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no other events can occur at any later time. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- If event2 could occur earlier than the initial event1, that contradicts “initially, event1 happened” (initial means first), so that’s not possible. Thus event2 does not happen — C1 is true.
- Similarly, event3 cannot happen because if it did it would require a later event1 or event2, but no later events are allowed; so event3 also cannot happen. But we do not need this to decide C2, because C1 is already true.
- Since C2 is (Event3 happens) OR (Event2 does not happen), and we have established Event2 does not happen, C2 is true.

- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

From these rules the allowed traces include:
- event1 → event3 → event2 (ends), or

Nothing in the rules forces that event2 must eventually occur — an infinite repetition of event1 and event3 is a permitted behavior that avoids event2.

Because event2 is not guaranteed in all allowed executions, the claim ""Event2 happens"" (C2) is not entailed by the context.

- State 0 (initial): event2 happened.
- Rules: after event2 → event1 at the next state; after event1 → event3 at the next state; after event3 → event1 at the next state.

Step 2 — propagate forward
- State 1 (next after initial): due to event2 at state 0, event1 must happen at state 1.
- State 2: due to event1 at state 1, event3 must happen at state 2.
- State 3: due to event3 at state 2, event1 must happen at state 3.
(So the sequence is state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event3, state3: event1, …)

Step 3 — evaluate the claims
- C1: “Event3 happens in the next state.” Interpreting “next state” relative to the initial state (state 1): event3 does not happen at state 1 (event1 does), so C1 is false.
- C2: “Event3 happens and C1 holds.” Because C1 is false, the conjunction C2 is false (even though event3 does happen later at state 2, C1 is not satisfied).

- Repeating these yields the mandatory sequence: state0: event3, state1: event1, state2: event3, state3: event1, … (an infinite alternation of event3 and event1).
- No rule requires event2 ever to occur. Nothing in the constraints forces event2 at any state or next-state position.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened, so ""Event1 happens"" is true at least initially.
- C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., event2 must occur in all possible sequences following the rules). We must check whether event2 is inevitable given the rules.
- From the rules: after event1, either event2 or event3 must happen. After event3, event1 must happen. So there is a valid sequence where, every time after event1, we choose event3 (allowed by ""either event2 or event3""). Then after event3 we return to event1, and again choose event3, and so on. In that entire run event2 never occurs.
- Because there exists a valid execution where event2 never happens, C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false.
- C2 requires both ""Event1 happens"" (true) and C1 (false). Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

Step 2 — examine the context rules:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event3 must happen. Since event2 has happened, event3 is obliged to occur.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" cannot be used to block that obligation: if event1 were to occur before the required event3, it would prevent a required future event and so would violate the given rules.

1. Interpret the conditions:
   - Initially E2 occurred.
   - After E3, E1 must follow.
   - After E1, next is either E2 or E3.
   - After E2, next is either E1 or E3.

2. Understand the claims:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — interpreted as E2 holds at every step (or equivalently, in all future states).
   - C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — requires C1 to be true.

3. Produce a counterexample run allowed by the rules:
   - Start: E2 (given).
   - Choose E2 → E3.
   - Then E3 → E1 (forced).
   - Choose E1 → E3.
   - Then E3 → E1, and repeat E1↔E3 forever.
   This produces the infinite sequence: E2, E3, E1, E3, E1, ... in which E2 does not occur after the initial step, so E2 does not ""always"" happen.

4. Conclusion:
   - C1 is false (E2 need not always occur).
   - Therefore C2 is false.

1. From the context: event3 has happened initially (so ""Event3 happens"" is true at least initially).
2. After event3, the rules require either event1 or event2 to happen (choice is not fixed).
3. If after event3 we pick event2, event2 happens and no further events can occur (so that branch yields C1 true for that run).
4. But the rules also allow after event3 to pick event1. After event1, event3 must happen, and then again after that event3 we may choose event1 again, and so on. That yields a possible infinite sequence ...3 → 1 → 3 → 1 → 3 ... with no event2 ever occurring.

1) What the hypothesis asks:
- C2 is the conjunction of ""Event3 happens"" and C1.
- C1 is ""Event2 always happens.""

2) The constraints:
- Initially event3 happened (so event3 does occur at least once).
- After event2 → either event1 or event3.
- After event1 → either event2 or event3.
- After event3 → either event1 or event2. (repeated, same rule)

3) Reasoning / counterexample:
- Start at the initial event3 (given).
- From event3, one allowed next event is event1.
- From event1, one allowed next event is event3.
- From event3 again, choose event1 again, and so on.

This yields an infinite valid sequence: e3, e1, e3, e1, ... in which event2 never occurs. That shows C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is not guaranteed. Although event3 does happen (initially), C1 fails in this permitted sequence.

4) Conclusion:
Because C1 can be false in a valid sequence, C2 (which requires C1) is not necessarily true.

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Since event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" forces an occurrence of event2.
- Whenever event2 occurs, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces an occurrence of event1.
- Thus event1 and event2 alternate; every occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1.

- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
(The repeated ""after event2 ..."" line is identical and gives no new constraint.)

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- From the initial event2, the next event must be event1 or event3.
- If we choose event3 immediately, then both event2 and event3 have occurred and C1 holds in that run.
- But we are allowed to choose event1 instead. From event1 the next event must be event2 or event3. If we choose event2, we return to the same situation as at the start.
- Therefore it is possible to follow an infinite sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... forever, never performing event3. That sequence satisfies all rules but does not include event3.

- After event3, no other events can happen (irrelevant to C2 except it prevents further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (not triggered here).

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2 is true if event3 happens or C1 holds.
- Event3 does happen (because it must follow the initial event1), so C2 is true regardless of C1.

We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event3 has happened (so event3 is already true).
- After event3, event2 must happen (so because event3 happened initially, event2 must occur at some following point).
- After event2, event3 must happen (this enforces alternation but does not prevent event2 from occurring).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant unless event1 occurs).

Step 3 — trace the sequence:
- Time 0: event3 has happened.
- By the rule ""after event3, event2 must happen"", event2 will occur at some later time.
- Once event2 occurs, the rule ""after event2, event3 must happen"" forces event3 again, and so on; but at least one occurrence of event2 is guaranteed after the initial event3.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C2 says that ""event2 and event3 both happen eventually"" (C1 eventually holds).
- From the context: initially event1 happened; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 no further events can occur; after event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
- These constraints allow both possibilities:
  - A trace that satisfies C1: event1 → event3 → event2 (event3 before event2). This is allowed: after event1 event2 still occurs later, and after event3 event2 occurs next; after event2 nothing else happens.
  - A trace that violates C1: event1 → event2 and then stop. This is also allowed (after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else can happen), and here event3 never occurs.
- Because there is an allowed execution where event3 never happens, C1 is not guaranteed to eventually hold in all models of the context. Thus C2 is not entailed by the premises.

So C2 is False."

Given the rules:
- Initially event1 has happened.

- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

From the initial event1 there are two possible continuations:
- Choose event2: sequence 1 → 2 → 1 → ... (and one can keep choosing 2 after each 1). This run has event2 but may never include event3.
- Choose event3: sequence 1 → 3 → 1 → ... (and one can keep choosing 3 after each 1). This run has event3 but may never include event2.

Thus there exist valid executions where event2 never happens (always pick 3 after 1), and valid executions where event3 never happens (always pick 2 after 1).

- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (implication: event2 → event1)
- C2: (event1 happens) AND (C1 holds)
We must decide whether C2 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context constraints
- Initially, event3 happened.
- After event3, no other events can happen. So once event3 has happened (and it has, initially), no further events can occur at any later time.
- After event1, event3 must happen. So any occurrence of event1 would require a later occurrence of event3.
- After event2, event3 must happen. So any occurrence of event2 would require a later occurrence of event3.

Step 3 — Reason about possible event occurrences
- Because event3 has already happened initially and no events can occur after it, neither event1 nor event2 can occur at any time after the initial state.
- Could event1 or event2 have occurred before the initial event3? No — the context states event3 happened initially, so there is no earlier time for them to occur. Also, if event1 (or event2) had occurred earlier, the rule ""after event1 (or event2), event3 must happen"" would require event3 to occur after them, contradicting that event3 is already initial and nothing happens afterward. Thus event1 and event2 cannot occur at all under the context.

Step 4 — Evaluate C1 and C2
- C1 (event2 → event1) is vacuously true because event2 does not occur, so the implication holds.
- However, C2 requires event1 to happen and C1 to hold. Although C1 holds, event1 does not happen. Therefore the conjunction in C2 is false.

</graphml>",0,"Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C2 (which is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context facts
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events may occur.)
- After event3, no other events can happen. (Event3 would also be terminal.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — derive consequences
- Because event1 happened initially and nothing can happen after event1, no other events (including event2 or event3) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 does not happen and event3 does not happen.

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis components
- C1: ""Event3 happens or event2 happens"" — both disjuncts are false, so C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" — both disjuncts are false (event2 does not happen, and C1 is false), so C2 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens and event3 happens"" (i.e., both events occur at some points).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds"" — meaning in every possible execution consistent with the rules, both event1 and event3 occur.

2. Understand the conditions (transition rules) and the initial state:
   - Initially, event3 has happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen.
   - After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

3. Reason about all possible sequences starting from the initial event3:
   - At the start event3 has already happened, so event3 is guaranteed to occur in every run.
   - From event3 the next event must be either event1 or event2.
     - If it is event1, then event1 has occurred.
     - If it is event2, then the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 on the next step.
   - Therefore, in every possible run event1 will occur (either immediately after the initial event3 or after a forced event2 → event1 step).

4. Conclusion:
   - Every permitted execution contains both event3 (initially) and event1 (forced to occur). So C1 holds in every execution.
   - Hence C2 is True."

- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen (this rule appears twice but is the same constraint).

Step 1 — clarify assumptions
- Time proceeds in discrete steps and exactly one event occurs at each step.
- ""Event3 always happens"" (C1) means event3 occurs at every step.

Step 2 — restate the rules
1. Initially event2 happens.
2. After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.
3. After event1, event3 must happen.
4. After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.

Step 3 — look for a counterexample to C2
We need a trace that makes C2 false: that is, C1 is false (event3 is not at every step) and event1 never happens.

Start with the required initial event2. From event2 we may choose event3 (rule 4). From event3 we may choose event2 (rule 2). Repeat. This yields the infinite alternating sequence:
2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, ...

In this sequence:
- event1 never occurs.
- event3 does not occur at every step (it occurs only on every second step), so C1 is false.

Thus C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is false in this valid trace.

- Initially event1 happened (so event1 has occurred at the start).
- After event1, event3 must happen (so event1 forces a later event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so event3 forces a later event1). Together these force event1 and event3 to recur (1 → 3 → 1 → 3 …).
- After event2, event3 must happen (if event2 occurs, it forces a later event3, and thus later event1 as well).

Trace/reasoning:
- The constraints mandate an alternating recurrence of event1 and event3 starting from the initial event1.
- Nothing in the given conditions requires that event2 ever occur. Event2 is allowed but not forced.
- If event2 does occur at some point, then because event1 already happened initially (and/or will happen again after the forced 3), C1 would hold; so in those runs C2 would be true.
- But since event2 is not guaranteed by the constraints, there are valid executions in which event2 never happens (only event1 and event3 alternate). In those executions C1 never becomes true, so C2 does not necessarily hold.

We must decide whether C2 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So event1 is terminal: once it has happened, the sequence ends.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 would also be terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- The initial fact that event1 happened means the timeline already contains event1 at the start.
- Because event1 is terminal, no other events can occur at all after that initial event1. Therefore event2 cannot happen in any allowed sequence.
- Since event2 cannot happen, ""Event2 always happens"" (C1) is false.
- Could event3 happen instead? No — event1 has already happened initially, so event3 does not occur. (If event3 had occurred, it would have to be before the initial event1, but ""initially event1 happened"" fixes the start as event1.)

- C1 is false.

- Since event1 has happened, the rule ""after event1, event3 must happen"" forces event3 to happen eventually (in fact next).
- Once event3 happens, event2 must happen afterwards.
- After event2, one of {event1, event3} must happen:
  - If event3 happens, we already have another occurrence of event3.
  - If event1 happens, that in turn forces event3 to happen afterward.
- Thus from the initial event1, event3 occurs and will continue to occur (directly or via the event1 → event3 loop). Therefore event3 inevitably eventually happens.

From the start we get at least the prefix: e2 → e3 → e1 → ...
After that e1 can be followed by e2 or by e3:
- If e1 → e2, the pattern repeats: e2 → e3 → e1 → e2 → e3 → e1 → … (so event2 occurs periodically).
- If e1 → e3, we get e2 → e3 → e1 → e3 → e1 → e3 → … (so after the initial e2, event2 never occurs again).

Consequences:
- Event1 does occur (it is forced after every event3), so the first part of C2 is true.
- But C1 (“Event2 always happens”) fails: there is a valid infinite run (e2, e3, e1, e3, e1, e3, …) in which event2 does not always occur (it occurs only initially and then never), so C1 is false.

- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → so event2 does happen.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen → two possible choices.
- After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Step 3 — trace possible sequences
- One allowed sequence: event1 → event2 → event3 (here event3 happens).

Reasoning (step by step):

- C1 (""If event3 happens, then event3 happens"") is a tautology (p → p) and therefore holds.
- C2 is the conjunction ""Event1 happens AND C1 holds"". Since C1 holds, C2 reduces to whether ""Event1 happens"".
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 either event1 or event3 must happen. That means there are two possible continuations: event1 occurs, or event3 occurs.
- Because a continuation where event3 happens (and then nothing else) is allowed, event1 is not guaranteed.

1. Hypothesis: C1 = ""Event3 eventually happens."" C2 = ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""
2. From the context: event3 happened initially. So C1 is satisfied (event3 does eventually happen).
3. The rule ""After event3, event2 must happen"" requires that whenever event3 occurs, event2 will occur afterward.
4. Since event3 did occur, that rule forces event2 to happen at some later time.
5. Therefore the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is satisfied.

Step 1 — what C2 asks:

- C2: C1 does not hold = Event1 does happen.
So we must decide whether Event1 must occur under the given rules.

- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event3, event2 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — trace possible sequences:
- Start: event2 (given).
- After that, we may choose event3. If we choose event3, rule says after event3 we must have event2, and after that we may again choose event3. This yields a repeating sequence: event2, event3, event2, event3, ... with no occurrence of event1. All rules are satisfied and event1 never happens.
- Alternatively we could choose event1 at some point, but that is optional whenever after an event2 we pick event1 instead of event3.

- Event1 is not forced to occur (there is a valid model where it never happens). Therefore C2 (""Event1 happens"") is not entailed/true.

- We must decide whether C2 (""C1 holds or event3 happens"") is necessarily true given the context rules and the initial state.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially (time 0): event2 is true; event3 is not stated to be true now.
- Rules (interpreted as next-state obligations):
  - After event2: in the next state either event1 or event3 must occur.
  - After event1: in the next state event3 must occur.
  - After event3: in the next state event1 must occur.

Step 3 — interpret the hypotheses
- C1: event3 happens in the next state (i.e., at time 1).
- C2: C1 holds OR event3 happens now (i.e., at time 0). So C2 is true iff either event3 occurs at time 1 or event3 occurs at time 0.

Step 4 — examine possible evolutions from the initial state
- From event2 at time 0, at time 1 either:
  a) event3 occurs. Then C1 is true, hence C2 is true.
  b) event1 occurs. Then event3 does not occur at time 1 (so C1 is false) and event3 did not occur at time 0 either. Event3 will occur at time 2, but that does not make C2 true (C2 only allows event3 at time 0 or time 1).

Because case (b) is allowed by the rules, there is a valid evolution where both disjuncts of C2 are false.

Conclusion
- C2 is not guaranteed by the given information; it can be false.

Reasoning (step by step):
- Hypothesis: C2 asserts that C1 always holds; C1 says ""Event1 always happens."" So C2 is claiming that in every possible execution, Event1 happens.
- From the context: ""Initially, event3 happened."" and ""After event3, no other events can happen."" Those together imply there is an execution (indeed the initial one) where event3 occurs and then no further events can occur.
- In that execution no Event1 can occur after the initial event3. The problem statement does not say Event1 also happened initially, so there is at least one execution (initial event3 only) where Event1 does not happen.
- Therefore C1 is not true in all executions, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false."

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., at every future step/event, event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (i.e., there exists a time after which event2 holds at every subsequent step).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Initially: event2 happened (time 0).
- After event2, event3 must happen (so time 1 = event3).
- After event3, event1 must happen (so time 2 = event1).
- After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen (choice).
- After event2, event3 must happen next.

Step 3 — trace sequences / produce counterexample
From the start: t0 = event2, t1 = event3, t2 = event1. At t3 we may choose event3 (allowed by ""after event1, either event2 or event3""). If we always choose event3 after every event1, the sequence is:
t0: event2, t1: event3, t2: event1, t3: event3, t4: event1, t5: event3, t6: event1, ...
In this run event2 occurs only at t0 and never again. So C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false at t0 and never becomes true later.

Step 4 — logical impossibility of C1 ever holding permanently
Even aside from the above run, C1 can never hold from some time N onward because any occurrence of event2 is immediately followed by event3. Thus you cannot have event2 at every subsequent time step (you cannot have two consecutive event2's), so ""event2 always happens"" can never become true at any point.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""

- Initially, event2 happened. (So event2 does occur in the described scenario.)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (This is exactly the same as C1: whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen.)
- Other rules: ""After event3, event1 must happen."" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" These do not conflict with the rule about event2→event1.

Step 3 — trace/reason
- The context explicitly states the implication ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" so any occurrence of event2 is required to be followed by event1.
- Therefore C1 is a direct consequence of the given conditions and holds in all models consistent with them.

Interpretation:
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e., at some state the immediate next event is event2.
- C2: ""eventually C1 holds"" — i.e., at some future point there is a transition labeled event2 (equivalently, event2 occurs at least once later).

Given conditions:
1. Initially event1 happened.
2. After event1, either event2 or event3 must happen next.
3. After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen next.
4. After event3, no other events can happen (event3 is terminal).

Reasoning / counterexample:
- Start: event1 (given).
- From event1 the next event could be event3 (allowed by condition 2).
- If event3 occurs next, condition 4 makes the execution terminal: no further events occur.
- In that run (event1 → event3) event2 never occurs, so there is no future state where ""next state is event2."" Thus C1 never holds on that run, so C2 (""eventually C1"") is false for that run.

- Event2 could then be followed by event1 and so on (1,2,1,2,...). Event3 is not required and, if it were to occur before event2, it would block the required event2, which would contradict the ""must happen"" rule; the constraints imply event3 cannot legitimately occur before the required event2.

- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., starting from the next state, event3 always happens).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, either event1 or event3 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event3, either event1 or event2 must happen.

Step 3 — construct a valid trace that violates C1:
- Start: event2 (given).
- Next: choose event1 (allowed, since after event2 either event1 or event3 may happen).
- After event1 we must have event2.
- After that event2 we may choose event1 again, and so on.
This yields the infinite trace: e2, e1, e2, e1, e2, ... which satisfies all constraints but never contains event3. Thus C1 (event3 always happens) is false.

- After event2, event3 must happen → gives a loop event3 → event2 → event3 → ...

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Starting point: only event3 has happened initially. Neither event1 nor event2 has happened at that initial moment.
