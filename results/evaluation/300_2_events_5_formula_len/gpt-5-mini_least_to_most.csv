Short answer: C5 is True (under the natural reading that ""Event2 always happens"" means: in every execution from the given initial condition, event2 does occur—indeed infinitely often). Below is the step-by-step reasoning you requested.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So the system forces an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … (continuing forever).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (same text as C2 and C3)
- C2: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C3: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (i.e., C2 → C3)
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" (i.e., C1 ∨ C4)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Given the initial event1 and the transition rules, event2 will indeed occur (immediately after the initial event1) and thereafter repeatedly as events alternate. Thus the assertion ""Event2 always happens"" is true in the sense that every run from the initial state contains event2 (in fact infinitely many times). Therefore C1, C2 and C3 are true.
- C4 (C2 → C3) is then true as well, because it is an implication between identical true statements (or more generally any A → A is true).
- C5 is C1 ∨ C4. Since C1 is true (and C4 is also true), the disjunction C5 is true.

Caveat: if by ""always happens"" you meant ""happens at every time instant / every step"" (i.e., event2 occurs at every moment), that stronger reading would be false, because event1 also occurs on alternating steps. Under that reading C1–C3 would be false and the conclusion would change. But under the usual interpretation used above (that every run includes event2, or event2 occurs whenever required by the rules), C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened. (So at the initial state “event1 happens” is true; “event2 happens” is false.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen in the following state(s).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen in the following state(s).
(So either event1 or event2, when they occur, lead to a state in which no further events occur.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
Evaluate each Ci in the initial state (and where specified, in the next state):

- C1: “Event1 does not happen.”  
  In the initial state event1 did happen, so C1 is False.

- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.”  
  After event1, no other events can happen, so in the next state event1 does not happen. Therefore C1 is true in the next state, so C2 is True.

- C3: “Event1 happens or C2 holds.”  
  In the initial state event1 happens (and C2 also holds), so the disjunction is True. Thus C3 is True.

- C4: “C3 does not hold.”  
  Since C3 is True, C4 is False.

- C5: “C4 does not hold.”  
  Since C4 is False, its negation C5 is True.

4) How the conditions relate
- From the initial fact (event1 happened) we get C1 = False, but because event1 prevents further events, in the next state event1 does not happen, so C2 = True. That makes C3 true (event1 ∨ C2), so C4 = ¬C3 = False, hence C5 = ¬C4 = True.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
- Therefore the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (so event2 occurs now and repeatedly thereafter).

- C3: Same as C2 (identical wording).
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (Implication between the two conditions C2 and C3.)

4) How they relate and truth values

- C4 is true: since C2 and C3 are identical (and both true), the implication ""if C2 then C3"" holds. More generally, an implication from a statement to itself is a tautology.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur after that point.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterwards.)

Combining A and B with the initial condition: event1 already happened initially, and rule A prevents any later events, so event2 cannot occur at any time in this scenario.

Step 3 — meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the initial condition, event1 happens, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" This is the disjunction (C1) ∨ (event1). Since C1 is true and event1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: Same as C2 (it is the same formula: C1 ∨ event1), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Formally, C2 ⇒ C3.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- C2 and C3 are identical formulas, so whenever C2 is true C3 is necessarily true.
- In the given scenario C2 is true and C3 is true, so the implication C2 ⇒ C3 is true.

Answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (it has happened initially).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at the next step).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the run ends after event1).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the formula P → P (with P = ""event2 happens""). As a logical implication this is always true (a tautology), and in the situation at hand event2 indeed happens, so C1 holds.
- C2: Identical to C1, so C2 also holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds now (it is a tautology), it certainly holds at some time in the future (indeed right away). So C3 holds.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both components hold, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" This is an implication whose consequent C4 is already true unconditionally, so the implication is true. Therefore C5 holds.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 and C2 are the same tautological statement about event2.
- C3 asserts that C2 holds at some time; because C2 is always true, C3 is true.
- C4 is the conjunction of C1 and C3, so it is true.
- C5 is the implication from event2 to C4; because C4 is true regardless of whether event2 occurs, the implication is true. In other words, C4 does not depend on event2, so event2 → C4 is satisfied.

Conclusion: C5 is True. (Note: this conclusion relies only on the logical form of the Ci statements; even under the given event ordering the same result follows.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 and C2 are tautologies (P → P) so they hold. Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") holds, and C4 (C1 ∧ C3) holds. With the consequent C4 true unconditionally, the implication C5 (event2 → C4) is true."

Short answer: C5 is True (under the natural temporal reading used by the context). Below are the step-by-step answers.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, event1 must (eventually) happen.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must (eventually) happen.
(So starting from the initial event1, the rules force an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ….)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (statement 1)
- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" (statement 2) — same as C1.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is equivalent to C1 (i.e. ""Event1 always happens"").
- C4: C3 holds or event2 happens. So C4 is true whenever either (a) event1 always happens, or (b) event2 has occurred.
- C5: If C4 holds, then event1 happens. Interpreted temporally, this says: whenever C4 is true, event1 will (or does) happen.

4) How these conditions relate to each other (and why C5 is True)
- Case A: If C3 holds (i.e. event1 always happens), then whenever C4 holds because of C3, event1 indeed happens (in fact it always does). So the implication C4 → event1 is satisfied in this subcase.
- Case B: If C4 holds because event2 has occurred, then by the transition rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 will occur (after event2). Thus the implication C4 → event1 is satisfied in this subcase too.
- Since C4 can only be true for one of those reasons, and in both reasons event1 follows, C5 is true.

Note on interpretation: this conclusion assumes the intended temporal reading of the rules (""must happen"" = ""will happen at or after that time""). If you instead read the implication C5 as requiring event1 to be simultaneous with C4 (i.e. happen at the exact instant C4 holds), you would need to clarify timing — but with the usual ""after X, Y must happen"" temporal interpretation, C5 holds.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur in the next step/soon after the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; there is no further event in any subsequent state).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" (redundant) This just means: event2 happens in the current state.
- C2: same as C1 — event2 happens in the current state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" That means event2 holds in the next state (i.e., event2 happens in the next state).
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" So C4 asserts event2 happens now and event2 happens in the next state.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally: C4 ⇒ event2.

4) How they relate and truth of C5
- Given the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" it is impossible for event2 to occur in a state after a state where event2 occurred. So C3 is false whenever event2 occurs now, and therefore C4 (which requires event2 now and event2 next) cannot hold in any model that respects the context.
- In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Thus since C4 is impossible (the antecedent of C5 is always false), C5 is true.
- (Also note: even ignoring vacuity, C4 already contains event2 as a conjunct (C1), so if C4 were to hold then event2 would certainly hold; so the implication C4 ⇒ event2 is also logically valid in that sense.)

Therefore C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True (because event1 holds initially, and C5 is “C4 or event1”).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 is true in the initial state (""Initially, event1 happened"").

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen: informally, whenever event1 occurs at some state, event2 will occur at some later state (event1 -> eventually event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen: once event2 occurs the system has no further events (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just event2 (a redundant conjunction), so C1 ≡ event2.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C2 says globally/eventually-for-all-states event2 holds (i.e., event2 is true in every state).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — C3 is the implication (C2 → event1).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C4 is X(C3) (C3 is true in the next state).
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — C5 is (C4 ∨ event1).

4) How they relate and truth value of C5
- We only need the value of event1 in the initial state to evaluate C5 there. Since the problem states event1 is true initially, the disjunction C4 ∨ event1 is true in the initial state regardless of C4’s truth.
- Therefore C5 is True in the initial state.

(If you want, I can also analyze whether C2, C3, or C4 are true under the given transition rules; for example, C2 is generally false because event2 is not true in every state, and C3 is vacuously true if C2 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C5 is C4 ∨ event1, and event1 is true in the initial state, so the disjunction is true there."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially (so event2 has occurred already).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given event2 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true (and logically equivalent to C1 in form here).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" So C4 is (event1 ∧ C3).
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally C5 is (C4 ⇒ event1).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and final conclusion?
- Because C4 is defined as (event1 ∧ C3), it already contains event1. In propositional logic (A ∧ B) ⇒ A is a tautology (always true). Thus C4 ⇒ event1 is always true regardless of whether C4 actually holds in the system.
- Concretely in this scenario, since event2 happened and no other events can happen after event2, event1 does not actually happen, so C4 is false. But whether C4 is false or true, the implication C4 ⇒ event1 is true (implication is true when antecedent is false, and would also be true if antecedent were true because event1 is part of the antecedent).

Therefore C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C4 is (event1 ∧ C3), so the implication C4 ⇒ event1 is a tautology ((A ∧ B) ⇒ A), hence true."

Reasoning (brief):
- State0 (initial): event1 is true; no events occur after that.
- C1 = event1 ∨ event2 → true at State0 (event1 true).
- C2 = event1 ∨ C1 → true at State0.
- C3 = ""eventually C2"" → true at State0 because C2 already holds now.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" → look at State1: no events ever occur after State0, so C2 never holds at or after State1, hence C3 is false at State1. Therefore C4 is false at State0.
- C5 = ""eventually C4"" → C4 is false at every state, so C5 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the initial time / has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the occurrence of event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal; nothing occurs after it).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
Interpretation (plain-language):
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (a conjunction: event2 never occurs, and event2 does occur)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (at some future time, C2 is true)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (at all times, C3 is true)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (C4 is false)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth values
- Given the initial condition that event2 did happen, C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 is the conjunction of C1 and ""event2 happens."" That requires both event2 never happens and event2 does happen simultaneously — a contradiction. Therefore C2 is false (at all times).
- C3 says C2 will be true at some time. Since C2 is impossible/always false, C3 is false.
- C4 says C3 is always true. Since C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold"" — i.e. ¬C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.
- Additional rules: after event1 happens, no other events can happen. Also, if event2 happens then no other events can happen (but event2 never actually happens here because event1 already happened).

2) Transition rules between events?
- Once event1 has occurred, the system reaches a state with no further events (so no occurrence of event2 later).
- The “after event2 no other events” rule is irrelevant because event2 does not occur in any trace starting with the given initial condition.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Given that event1 already happened initially, C1 is true in the initial state (there exists a point — the initial point — where event1 occurs).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” This means: at every state along the execution, C1 is true (i.e., from every state, event1 will occur at some current or future point). Whether C2 holds depends on the interpretation of time:
  - Under the usual temporal reading (F p = p holds now or at some future state), C1 is true at the initial state but may be false at later states if event1 is only true at the initial state and does not reoccur. So C2 need not hold.
- C3: “C1 always holds.” (Same formula as C2.)

4) How the conditions relate?
- C2 and C3 are identical statements (“C1 always holds”).
- C4: “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” This is an implication of a statement to itself (A → A), which is a logical tautology. Therefore C4 is true in all cases:
  - If C2 is true, then C3 (being the same statement) is certainly true.
  - If C2 is false, the implication C2 → C3 is still true (false antecedent makes the implication true).

Conclusion: Regardless of whether C2/C3 actually hold in this system, C4 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True. C2 and C3 are the same statement (“C1 always holds”), so the implication C2 → C3 is a tautology (A → A), hence true."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 -> event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 -> event1.)
These produce a cycle: event1 implies event2, and event2 implies event1.

3) Meaning of the Ci
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is just ""event2 happens,"" C2 is also equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (redundant).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Given C2 implies event2, C3 is an implication that follows from the rule event2 -> event1 (or at least is entailed by it).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (Negation of C3.)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" So C5 = not(C4) = not(not(C3)) which, in classical logic, is equivalent to C3.

4) How they relate / truth evaluation
- From the initial condition and the rule event1 -> event2, event2 does happen. So C1 and C2 (both equivalent to ""event2 happens"") are true.
- Given C2 is true and the rule event2 -> event1, C3 (C2 -> event1) is true (it is entailed by the context).
- Therefore C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.
- Hence C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true.

So C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (a state where event1 has occurred is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (a state where event2 has occurred is terminal).
So the initial state (where event2 happened) has no successor states.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — the next-state (immediate successor) satisfies event2.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” — negation of C1.
- C3: “C2 always holds” — C2 holds at every state along the (future) path(s) from the current state.
- C4: same as C1.
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds” — the implication C3 → C4.

4) How they relate and truth values
- At the initial state there is no next state (because after event2 no other events can happen). Under the usual semantics:
  - A next-state claim (C1 or C4) is false when there is no successor, so C1 = false and C4 = false.
  - C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 = true in the initial state.
  - C3 (“C2 always holds”) is true, because the only reachable state is the initial state and C2 holds there.
- Therefore the antecedent of C5 (C3) is true and the consequent (C4) is false, so the implication C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state has no successor, so ""Event2 in the next state"" (C1/C4) is false. Hence C2 = ¬C1 is true, and C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true. Thus C3 → C4 is true → false, so C5 is false."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).
- Interpretation: ""After X"" means strictly later in time.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens at some time t, then event1 must happen at some time t' > t (event1 must occur after event2).
- Rule B: If event1 happens at some time t, then no other events can happen at times > t (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There exists some time when event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → C1. Since C1 says event2 happens eventually, this implication is true whenever event2 happens (and is vacuously true if event2 never happens).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" (C2 ∨ event2)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (¬C3)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (¬C4)

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event1 happened initially and event1 forbids any later events, no event can occur after that initial event. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event. There is no earlier time for event2 (we take “initially” as the start), so event2 cannot ever happen. Hence C1 is false.
- C2 (event2 → C1) is true: either vacuously (if event2 never happens the implication is true) or trivially (if event2 did happen, that would imply event2 eventually happens). So C2 is true.
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2 is therefore true (because C2 is true).
- C4 = ¬C3 is false.
- C5 = ¬C4 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, the system has no further events (event1 is terminal).

From Rule B and the initial condition (event1 already happened), no further events (including event2) can occur in any future.

Step 3 — meaning of the C-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds ⇒ (C2 ∨ C3). Since C2 and C3 are the same as C1, C4 is equivalent to C1.
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds ⇒ C1 ∧ C4. With the equivalence above, C5 ≡ C1 ∧ C1 ≡ C1.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Because event1 occurred initially and Rule B prevents any further events, every possible execution has event1 (it already happened). So the proposition ""Event1 always happens"" (C1) is true under the given context.
- Therefore C4 is true (it’s just C1), and thus C5 (C1 ∧ C4) is true.

Answer: C5 is True.

Combining initial condition and rules: because event2 already happened initially and event2 is terminal, no other events can happen anywhere in this execution — in particular event1 does not occur.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (so the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so any occurrence of event1 is followed by event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 ≡ (event1 happens).  
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — with C1 ≡ event1, C2 is (event1 → event1), which is a logical tautology (always true for any truth value of event1).  
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is a tautology, it holds in every state/time, so C3 is true.  
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — because C3 is true, the disjunction is true (whether or not event2 actually happens at a given time).  
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — since C4 is true in every state (because C3 is true in every state), C5 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- C2 is a tautology, so C3 (its ""always"" form) is true. That makes C4 true everywhere, and therefore C5 (""always C4"") is true. The specific dynamics (event2 was initial and terminal) don't change this logical chain because C2 was already universally true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.

Therefore C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 ≡ event1. C2 is (event1 → event1), a tautology, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true. Thus C4 (""event2 or C3"") is true everywhere, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true. The initial/transition facts don't affect this logical chain."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Now the step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state). event1 does not happen initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (a terminal state if event1 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (a terminal state if event2 occurs).
Given that event2 happened initially, the run consists of that initial state with event2 true and then no further state with any event.

(Assumption made: we treat the behavior as ending after the initial state — i.e., there is no next state. If your temporal semantics force infinite runs by stuttering, interpretations can change; see note at the end.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreting “always” as the temporal operator G (globally): G(event2) — event2 holds in every state along the run.
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” That is X(C2) (next C2).
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” That is F(C3) (finally / eventually C3).
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds (C1 ∧ C4).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- C1 (G event2): True. In the actual run the only state is the initial one and event2 is true there, so event2 holds in every state of the run.
- C2: True (same as C1).
- C3 (X C2): False, because there is no next state after the initial state, so “next” is not satisfied.
- C4 (F C3): False, because C3 never becomes true at any time (there is no next state where C2 would hold).
- C5 (C1 ∧ C4): True ∧ False = False.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Note on semantics: If you use an alternative model (e.g., LTL over infinite traces with a self-loop after terminal states, or a semantics where X of a non-existent next state is treated differently), some of the intermediate truth values might change. Under the plain reading above (finite run ending after initial event2, and X requires an actual successor), the result is as shown and C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 follows event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 follows event2).
Thus the system forces alternation: starting from the initial event2, event1 will occur next, then event2, then event1, etc. In particular event1 occurs (indeed infinitely often) on the run.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the alternation, this is true (event1 happens next).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" This is true (both disjuncts are true: C1 is true, and event1 actually occurs).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 holds, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 is false now and (under the alternation) C2 will continue to hold, C3 is false in the next state as well, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication whose antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).

4) How they relate & conclusion
- Because C1 and C2 are true and C3/C4 are false, the antecedent of C5 is false; therefore C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True (under the usual/classical interpretation below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” So once event2 has happened, no further events (including event1) can occur.
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” (Symmetric absorbing property for event1.)
Given event2 happened initially, that already prevents any subsequent events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 does not happen. (A claim that event1 never occurs.)
- C2: C1 does not hold. (The negation of C1: i.e. event1 does happen.)
- C3: If C2 holds, then event1 happens. (Implication: C2 → event1.)
- C4: If event2 happens, then C3 holds. (Implication: event2 → C3.)
- C5: C4 eventually holds. (Claim that C4 is true at some time — in particular it already holds now.)

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition “event2 happened” and “after event2 no other events can happen,” event1 cannot happen. So C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 (negation of C1) is false.
- C3 is the implication “if C2 then event1.” An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth), so C3 is true.
- C4 says “if event2 happens, then C3 holds.” Event2 did happen and C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5 says “C4 eventually holds.” Because C4 already holds (now), C5 is true under the standard reading of “eventually” (which allows the present moment).

Note on semantics: if you use a nonstandard reading of “eventually” that requires a strictly later time point and you require C4 to hold at that later point, then since no further transitions occur after event2 you would need C4 to hold at a later state. But C4 is a factual implication about the situation and holds in the initial state; under usual logics/temporal semantics “eventually” includes the current moment, so C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 happened initially so event1 cannot occur (C1 true, C2 false). C3 (C2 → event1) is vacuously true, and since event2 holds and C3 is true, C4 holds now. With the usual interpretation of ""eventually"" that includes the present moment, C5 is true."

Summary answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Additional facts (given): ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So whichever event happens, the system becomes terminal and no further events occur. Because event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both rules mean: if event1 occurs, there is no transition to any state where further events occur; likewise for event2. Thus once an event has occurred the execution stops (no later occurrence of event1 or event2).

3) Meaning and evaluation of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
  - In the initial state event1 has happened, so C1 is True.

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
  - Interpreting this as: in the immediate next state, either event1 or event2 happens. But because after event1 no other events can happen, there is no next state in which event1 or event2 occurs. So C2 is False.

- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens.""
  - Both disjuncts are false: C2 is False (see above), and event2 does not happen (cannot happen after event1). So C3 is False.

- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds.""
  - Event2 does not happen, and C3 is False, so C4 is False.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold.""
  - Since C4 is False, C5 is True.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 is true because event1 already occurred.
- C2 tries to assert that one of the events occurs in the next state; that fails because the scenario forbids any further events after event1.
- C3, C4 depend on C2 and/or event2 and therefore are false.
- C5 is simply the negation of C4, so it is true.

Final truth values:
- C1: True
- C2: False
- C3: False
- C4: False
- C5: True

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Answer: True.

Reasoning (assuming the usual ""next"" semantics where Xφ is false in a state with no successor):

- Initial state: event1 happened, so C1 (event1 or event2) = True.
- After event1 no further events can happen, so there is no next state in which event1 or event2 occurs. Therefore C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") = False.
- C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") = False (both disjuncts false).
- C4 (""event2 happens and C3 holds"") = False.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") = the negation of False = True.

Note: if your formalism treats ""next"" over a dead-end state as vacuously true (some branching-time conventions for AX over empty successor sets), the truth of C2 might differ; under that alternative C5 could change. Under the standard linear-time ""next"" used here, C5 is True."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time/state s0) event1 happened.
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred at s0, in every later state s1, s2, ... no event occurs).
- Also: if event2 ever happens at some time, then event1 must happen after it (this condition never gets to apply in our run because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur afterward).

2) Transition rules / reachable behaviors
- Because event1 occurs initially and “after event1 no other events can happen”, the only possible infinite run is:
  s0: event1 occurs
  s1, s2, ... : no events occur
- event2 never occurs in any state of this run.

3) What each C* means (interpreting them in standard linear-time temporal logic)
- Let p mean “event1 happens in the current state”.
- C1: “Event1 always happens” = G p (p holds in the current and all future states).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” = F (G p) (there exists some future state from which p holds forever).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” = X (F (G p)) (at the next state, C2 is true).
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” = X X (F (G p)) (two steps ahead, C2 is true).
- C5: “C4 eventually holds” = F (X X (F (G p))) (there exists some future state where C4 is true).

4) How these relate and evaluation on the run
- Truth of p by state: p is true at s0, false at s1, s2, ...
- C1 = G p is false at s0 (and at every state) because p fails at s1 (and later).
- Because C1 never holds at any state, C2 = F(C1) is false (there is no future state where C1 holds).
- Then C3 = X(C2) is false (C2 is false at s1), and C4 = X(C3) is false (C3 is false at s2).
- Finally C5 = F(C4) is false because C4 is false at every state (so there is no future state where C4 holds).

Conclusion: Given the initial event1 and the rule that no events occur afterwards, none of the nested conditions become true at any future state, so C5 is False.

Short answers up front: C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = False, C4 = True, so C5 = True (with the usual reading that events are sequential and ""initially event1 happened"" means event2 never occurs).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at the start of the scenario event1 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
So each event is terminal: once it occurs, it prevents any later events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (a claim that event2 never occurs)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (an implication: event1 ⇒ (event2 does not happen))
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" (conjunction: event2 occurs AND C2 is true)
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" (either C3 is true, or event1 happened)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (C4 is true in the actual/possible states — here read as a global/always truth about the scenario)

4) How do these conditions relate, and what is the truth value of C5?
- From (1) and (2): since initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot happen at any later time. Because event1 already happened at the start, event2 never occurs. Therefore C1 is True.
- C2 is the statement ""if event1 happens then C1"". Event1 does happen and C1 is True, so the implication is True; hence C2 is True.
- C3 requires ""event2 happens"" and C2. Since event2 does not happen, the conjunction is False. So C3 is False.
- C4 is ""C3 or event1"". C3 is False but event1 did happen, so C4 is True.
- C5 says ""C4 always holds."" Given the scenario's initial fact that event1 happened and that no further events can change that (both events are terminal and event1 already occurred), C4 is always true in this scenario. Thus C5 is True.

(If you allow simultaneous occurrence of events or read ""initially event1 happened"" differently, you could get different edge cases — but under the standard sequential reading above, C5 is True.)

Answering step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (we start in a state where event2 already occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so there is no next event after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (not directly relevant here because event1 does not occur initially).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" (equivalently: event2 -> C1)
- C3: same as C2 (it is the same statement: event2 -> C1)
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (C2 -> C3)

4) How these conditions relate and truth values
- From (1) and (2): because event2 already happened and no events can occur after event2, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2 (and identically C3) is the implication (event2 -> C1). In the current situation event2 is true (it happened) while C1 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C2 = false and C3 = false.
- C4 is the implication (C2 -> C3). With C2 false and C3 false, the material implication false -> false is true. Also note more generally C2 and C3 are the same formula, so C2 -> C3 is a tautology (it cannot be false).

Conclusion: C4 is True (under standard/material implication). If you meant a different interpretation of ""if"" or of the temporal operators, say so and I can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C2 and C3 are the same formula (event2 -> C1), so C2 -> C3 is an instance of A -> A, which is always true under standard/material implication. Equivalently, in the given scenario C1 is false and event2 is true, so C2 and C3 are both false and false -> false is true."

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no further events can occur, so event1 does not happen in the next state → C1 (and C4) is False.
- Event2 cannot happen after event1, so ""if event2 happens then C1"" is vacuously true → C2 is True.
- C2 is True and event1 did happen initially, so ""if C2 then event1 happens"" is True → C3 is True.
- C5 is ""if C3 then C4"": antecedent True, consequent False → C5 is False."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen.
(So each event, if it occurs, is absorbing — it prevents any further events.)

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e. event2 never occurs).
- C2: the same as C1 (a duplicate statement).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — the negation of C2, i.e. event2 does happen.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" — either event2 never happens, or event2 does happen.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — at some point (including now) C4 is true.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Because event1 has already happened and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event2 cannot happen at any time. Therefore C1 (and thus C2) is true.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.
- C4 is C1 or C3; since C1 is true, C4 is true.
- ""Eventually"" includes the present moment; since C4 already holds, C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 has already occurred and prevents any further events, so event2 never happens (C1 true, C2 true, C3 false), hence C4 is true now and therefore C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 ⇒ event1).
Together these imply a back-and-forth: since event2 happened initially, event1 must happen next, and then event2 must follow, etc.

Step 3 — meaning of C1–C4
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” Given the initial condition, C1 is false (event2 does happen).
- C2: “C1 holds or event1 happens” — i.e. (¬event2) ∨ event1. Since event1 does happen (by the transition rule from the initial event2), C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is also true.
- C4: “If C2 holds, then C3 holds” — the formula C2 ⇒ C3.

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- C2 and C3 are the same statement, and both evaluate to true here. An implication is false only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. That does not occur.
- Therefore C4 is true. (Also, logically C2 ⇒ C3 is a tautology when C2 and C3 are identical.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C2 and C3 are the same formula, so C2 ⇒ C3 is a tautology (always true)."

Short answer: C5 is True (under the usual semantics where ""eventually"" includes the current state). Explanation follows step-by-step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Given event2 happens initially and event2 is terminal, no further events (including event1) can ever happen.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., event1 holds / occurs.)
- C2: C1 does not hold (¬C1).
- C3: Event1 always happens (same as C1).
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds (C4 = ¬C1 ∨ C1).
- C5: C4 eventually holds (i.e., at some point in time C4 is true).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- C1 is false, because event1 never happens (event2 happened initially and blocks any further events).
- Therefore C2 = ¬C1 is true.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4 = C2 ∨ C3 = true ∨ false = true. (In fact ¬C1 ∨ C1 is a tautology, so C4 is true in any state.)
- C5 asks whether C4 eventually holds. Because C4 is true right away (in the initial state), it trivially holds eventually, so C5 is true.

Caveat: this conclusion assumes the usual interpretation of ""eventually"" that allows the property to hold immediately (standard LTL-style F). If one insisted that ""eventually"" means strictly at some later state and the system has no future states after the initial one, then ""eventually"" could be read as false. Under the standard interpretation, though, C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True (given the natural reading below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially; event1 has not happened.

(I'm reading ""event X happened"" as a proposition that is true once X has occurred — i.e., a persistent fact ""X has happened"".)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens no other events can happen.
- After event2 happens no other events can happen.
Because event2 has already happened initially, the system cannot have any further events after the initial moment.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 ≡ (event1 happened) ∨ (event2 happened).
- C2 ≡ same as C1.
- C3 ≡ C1 ∨ C2 (so C3 is true exactly when C1 or C2 is true — redundant here).
- C4 ≡ C3 ∨ (event1 happened).
- C5 ≡ ""always C4"" (C4 holds at every point in time / in every future state).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth-values?
- Initially, event2 happened, so (event2 happened) is true; therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.
- Hence C3 = C1 ∨ C2 is true.
- Hence C4 = C3 ∨ event1 is true.
- No further events can change the facts (because after event2 no other events can happen), so in every future state the same facts remain: event2 happened stays true, so C1–C4 remain true at all times.
- Therefore C5 (""always C4"") is true.

Note about interpretation: if instead you interpreted ""event X happens"" as an instantaneous, non-persistent occurrence that is only true at the single instant it occurs, then the answer could change (e.g., C4 might be true only at the initial instant and false later, making C5 false). Under the usual reading for such problems — that ""happened"" is a persistent fact or that truth persists after events that forbid further changes — C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Because event2 has already happened and ""happened"" is taken as persistent, C1–C4 are true initially and remain true in all future states, so C5 (""always C4"") holds."

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at some later point event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

A possible timeline consistent with these rules: at time 0 event1 holds; at some later time event2 holds; after that nothing else occurs.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (True if event1 holds now or at some future time.)
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (Same as C1.)
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" (This is equivalent to ""event1 happens or event1 eventually happens"" — logically equivalent to ""event1 eventually happens"".)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" (There exists a time now or later when C3 is true.)
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" (Conjunction of C1 and C4.)

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Since event1 already happened at the initial state, C1 is true. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is true.
- Hence C3 is true (because event1 happens OR C2 holds — both are true).
- If C3 is true now, then ""eventually C3"" (C4) is also true (eventually includes the current moment).
- Therefore both C1 and C4 are true, so C5 (C1 AND C4) is true.

Short answer: C5 is True (given the usual reading below). Explanation step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the start of the execution there is an occurrence of event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur sometime after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the single possible sequence consistent with the rules is: event2 (initial) → event1 → nothing else.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (we take this to mean “event2 does occur in this system/run” — i.e., it happens.)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: “Event1 happens and C2 holds.” So C3 is true iff event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” (negation of C3).
- C5: “C1 holds or C4 holds” (logical OR of C1 and C4).

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- From the context, event2 does happen (initially), so C1 and C2 are true.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so event1 does happen; with C2 true, C3 (“event1 happens and C2 holds”) is true.
- Therefore C4 (the negation of C3) is false.
- C5 = C1 OR C4 = True OR False = True.

Note on ambiguity: If “always happens” were taken in a stronger sense (e.g., “at every time point” or “repeatedly at all times”), then C1/C2 might be false; under that alternate reading the evaluation could change.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (state S0) event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. Because event1 happened initially, no events can occur in any future state S1, S2, ...
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs under Rule A.)

2) Transition/temporal consequences
- Since event1 already happened at S0 and Rule A forbids any further events, event2 cannot occur in any future state (S1, S2, ...).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (evaluated at the initial state S0 unless otherwise stated)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” At S0 this asks whether event2 occurs at S1. False (no events after S0).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” At S0 this means: at S1, is it true that event2 happens in S2? That is false too (no events).
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 is false, C3 is true (negation of false).
- C4: “C3 holds or event1 happens.” At S0, C3 is true (and event1 also happened at S0), so C4 is true.
- C5: “C4 always holds.” This requires C4 to be true at every state S0, S1, S2, ...

4) How they relate and final check of C5
- For any state Si (i ≥ 0): event2 never occurs (by Rule A), so C1 is false at every state; therefore C2 is false at every state; thus C3 is true at every state; hence C4 (C3 or event1) is true at every state (C3 already makes it true).
- Therefore C4 holds in all states, so C5 (“C4 always holds”) is True.

- C2: ""Event1 always happens."" (the same claim as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (C3 is the implication C1 → C2)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (C3 is true at all times)
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" (there is some time at which C4 is true)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values here?
- From the context, event1 never occurs, so C1 is false and C2 is false.
- C3 is the implication C1 → C2. False → False evaluates to True (implication is vacuously true when the antecedent is false, and here antecedent and consequent are identical).
- C3 is therefore true; since C3 is a global logical truth in this setting, ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is true.
- If C4 always holds, then in particular it holds at some time — so ""C4 eventually holds"" (C5) is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- Additional constraints: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — i.e. once event1 has occurred no further events occur, and likewise for event2.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: if event1 occurs, no other event (including event2) can occur afterward; the same holds if event2 occurs. Given the initial fact that event1 happened, event2 cannot happen later.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — this is false because event1 did happen.
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen"" — same as C1, also false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — formal: C2 → event1. Since C2 is false, the implication C3 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — since C3 is true, C4 is true (disjunction true if either disjunct is true).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" — formal: C1 → C4. C1 is false, so this implication is true (again vacuously true).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 did happen, C1 and C2 are false.
- From that, C3 is true (false ⇒ anything is true), hence C4 is true, and any implication with a false antecedent (C1 → C4) is true.
- Therefore C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is False (under the usual reading that events are instantaneous occurrences). I’ll show why step by step and note the small ambiguity that could change the answer.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the initial moment.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: “After event2, event1 must happen.” (If event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur afterwards.)
- Rule B: “After event1, no other events can happen.” (Once event1 has occurred, no further events — neither event1 nor event2 — can occur later.)

3) What each sub-condition means (logical form)
- C1: event2 OR event1.
- C2: event2 OR event1. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 OR event2 = (event2 OR event1) OR event2 = event2 OR event1.
- C4: C1 OR C3 = (event2 OR event1) OR (event2 OR event1) = event2 OR event1.
- C5: “C4 always holds” = always(event2 OR event1) — i.e., at every time point, either event2 or event1 holds.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Algebraically all C1–C4 reduce to the same proposition: event2 OR event1.
- Given the initial conditions and transition rules:
  - At the initial moment event1 is true, so C4 holds initially.
  - By Rule B, after event1 no other events can occur, so at all later times neither event1 nor event2 occurs (both are false at those later times if events are instantaneous occurrences).
  - Therefore event2 OR event1 is false at those later times, so C4 does not hold at all times.
- Hence C5 = “always(event2 OR event1)” is false.

Note on ambiguity: If you instead read “event1 happened” as setting a persistent flag (once true, it remains true forever), then event1 would be true at all times and C4 would hold always, so C5 would be true. My conclusion (C5 is False) assumes the more common interpretation that events are instantaneous occurrences and do not remain true at later times.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

With instantaneous events: event1 holds at the initial moment but thereafter no events occur, so ""always(event2 OR event1)"" fails. (If event1 were persistent rather than instantaneous, C5 would be True.)"

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 is true (happened).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen: logically E2 → E1.
- After event1, event2 must happen: logically E1 → E2.
So E1 ↔ E2 (each implies the other).

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — i.e. E2 ∧ E1.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e. (E2 ∧ E1) → E1.
- C3: same as C2 (you repeated it): (E2 ∧ E1) → E1.
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds — i.e. [(E2 ∧ E1) → E1] ∨ [(E2 ∧ E1) → E1].

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the initial E1 and the rules, E1 → E2 gives E2, so both E1 and E2 are true; therefore C1 (E2 ∧ E1) is true.
- (E2 ∧ E1) → E1 is a tautology in this case (indeed any conjunction implies each conjunct), so C2 is true. C3 is identical, so C3 is true.
- C4 is C2 ∨ C3 = true ∨ true = true.

Therefore C4 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happens.

(Assumption: ""happens"" is a state proposition: it is true or false in each state. ""Initially"" means in the first state event1 is true.)

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreted as: in any state where event1 is true, the following state(s) have no events true (so event1 and event2 are false in the next state).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as a constraint that whenever event2 is true in some state, event1 must be true in the following state. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs in the given initial trace.)

(If you meant different temporal scopes for ""after"" — e.g. ""eventually after event2"" — the conclusion still does not change for the scenario below.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 happens and event1 happens (equivalently: event1). So C1 is true exactly in states where event1 is true.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens. Formally C2 = (C1 → event1). This is tautologically true in any state where C1 is false; if C1 is true it requires event1 to be true (which is the same as C1), so in practice C2 holds whenever event1 holds, and also holds whenever C1 is false (because false → anything is true).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.
- C4: event1 happens and event1 happens (same as C1).
- C5: C3 or C4.

4) How they relate (truth evaluation in our scenario)
- Initial state: event1 is true, so C1 is true. Then C2 = (C1 → event1) is true (true → true).
- Next state: by ""after event1 no other events can happen"", the next state has no events, so event1 is false there. In that next state C1 is false, so C2 (which is C1 → event1) is true in the next state (false → whatever = true). Therefore C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true.
- C4 = C1 is true in the initial state.
- C5 = C3 ∨ C4 = true ∨ true = true.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it has occurred).
- Also given: after event1 no other events can happen; and after event2 no other events can happen. So both event1 and event2 are terminal — once one of them has occurred, nothing else can occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- There are effectively no allowable transitions after event1 (and none after event2). Since event1 has already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur after that. So in this scenario event2 does not happen.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a material implication. Because event1 is true and event2 is false in this situation, the implication is false. So C1 = False.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 = False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 is False, but event1 is True, so C3 = True.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Both parts are True, so C4 = True.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" This is an implication C1 -> C4. Since C1 is False, the implication is vacuously true (a false antecedent makes a material implication true). So C5 = True.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary)
- Event1 having happened and being terminal implies event2 did not happen.
- That makes C1 and C2 false (they claim event1 implies event2).
- Because event1 is true, C3 becomes true regardless of C2.
- C4 is then true (event1 and C3).
- C5 is true because its antecedent C1 is false, so the implication C1 -> C4 is vacuously true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 is true and event2 is false (event1 is terminal), so C1 and C2 are false. C3 = C2 or event1 = True, so C4 = event1 and C3 = True. C5 is the implication C1 -> C4; since C1 is false the implication is vacuously true."

Short answer: C5 is False (under the usual linear-time “next” semantics where there is no successor state after event2).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen after that (the system terminates / there are no outgoing transitions from a state where event2 has occurred).

3) What each sub-condition means and its truth value:
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” This is true in the initial state because event2 has already happened.
- C2: “Event2 eventually happens.” Same as C1, so true.
- C3: “C1 holds and C2 holds.” True ∧ True = True (so C3 is true in the initial state).
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” We must ask whether there is a next state. Given “after event2 no other events can happen,” there is no successor state after the initial state. Under the standard interpretation of the “next” operator (X p is false if there is no successor), C4 is false.
- (If one used a different model where time can stutter or an infinite sequence of identical terminal states exists, C4 could be true; but with the stated rule “no other events can happen” the natural reading is no successor exists.)

4) How they relate and C5:
- C5 is “Event1 happens or C4 holds.” Event1 does not happen (it cannot happen after event2 and was not stated to have happened before), and we found C4 is false. So C5 = False ∨ False = False.

Conclusion: C5 is False (under the usual semantics where “next” requires an actual successor state).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 already occurred so event1 is false; there is no successor state, so the ""next"" condition C4 is false. Thus C5 = (event1) ∨ (C4) = False ∨ False = False."

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: at time/state 0, E2 is true (E2 holds initially).

2) Transition rules
- If E2 holds in a state t, then E1 holds in the next state t+1.
- If E1 holds in a state t, then E2 holds in the next state t+1.
- So the states alternate: t0: E2, t1: E1, t2: E2, t3: E1, ...

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" = E1 ∧ E2 (both true in the same state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = globally (E1 ∧ E2) — C1 true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 (it is not the case that C1 holds in every state).
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" = E2 → C3 (in a given state).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = next-state(C4).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the alternating sequence, in no single state are E1 and E2 both true. So C1 is false in every state.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- Hence C3 = ¬C2 is true (globally true).
- C4 is the implication E2 → C3. Since C3 is true, E2 → C3 is true in every state (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- Therefore C4 holds in every state, in particular it holds in the next state after the initial state. That means C5 is true in the initial state.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Brief justification: C1 (E1 ∧ E2) never holds in any state (events alternate), so C2 (always C1) is false and C3 = ¬C2 is true in every state. Thus the implication C4 (E2 → C3) is true in every state, so it holds in the next state as well; hence C5 is True."

Short answer: C5 is False (under the natural reading that the Ci are statements about the whole run — i.e., ""event2 never occurs"").

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 has already happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after the initial state).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (interpreting them as global/run properties)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., in this execution/run, event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every point in time C1 is true — equivalent to C1 under this global reading).
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen"" (same as C1).
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" (so C4 is true exactly when event2 never occurs).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (there exists some time in the run from which C4 is true).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From (2), event2 must occur after event1, so event2 does occur in the run.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does happen), and C3 is false for the same reason.
- C2 is false as well (the property ""event2 never occurs"" does not hold).
- Hence C4 = (C2 or C3) is false at all times.
- Therefore C5 (""eventually C4 holds"") is false — there is no time at which C4 becomes true.

(If instead you intended C1/C3 to mean ""event2 is not occurring at the current instant"" rather than ""never occurs in the run"", the evaluation changes: C3 would be true initially and so C4 would hold initially and C5 would be true. But under the standard/global interpretation used above, C5 is False.)

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen in the next state.
So the system forces an alternating sequence of events: event1, event2, event1, event2, … Given the initial event1, event2 will indeed happen in the next state.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (a proposition that is true given the rules and the initial event1)
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” i.e. C2 = ¬C1
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” i.e. C3 = ¬C2
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” i.e. C4 = ¬C3
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” i.e. C5 = ¬C4

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
Evaluate stepwise using ¬ as logical negation:
- C1 is true (from the transition rules).
- C2 = ¬C1 = ¬true = false.
- C3 = ¬C2 = ¬false = true.
- C4 = ¬C3 = ¬true = false.
- C5 = ¬C4 = ¬false = true.

C5 is True. (More generally, Cn is true for odd n and false for even n in this chain.)

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is true initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal.
- Given event1 happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: If event1 happens, then event1 happens. This is the proposition p → p (with p = ""event1 happens""). p → p is a logical tautology, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1 (also p → p), so C2 is true.
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Since C1 is true and C2 is true (and in fact both are tautologies), C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1 (p → p), so C4 is true.
- C5: C3 holds or C4 holds (C3 ∨ C4). A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1, C2, C4 are identical tautologies, so they are all true regardless of the event-transition facts.
- C3 is an implication between true statements, so it is true.
- Therefore at least one of C3 or C4 is true (indeed both are), so their disjunction C5 is true.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the initial time.

2) Transition rules
- After an occurrence of event2, event1 must occur at some later time.
- After an occurrence of event1, event2 must occur at some later time.
- Therefore, starting from the initial event2, the system forces an alternating sequence event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... — in particular, both events occur infinitely often.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — this is a proposition true at any time when one of the events occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there exists a (possibly current) future time where C1 is true (i.e., some event occurs).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — at every time point, C2 holds; equivalently, from every time there will be some future time with an event (G F C1).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — at some future time C3 is true (F G F C1).
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds"" — whenever event1 occurs, C4 must be true thereafter.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event2 occurs initially, C1 is true at the initial time, hence C2 holds now.
- Given the alternating rules, from every time there will be a future event, so C2 holds at every time; thus C3 (always C2) is true.
- Since C3 already holds now, C4 (""eventually C3"") is also true (it holds immediately).
- C4 is therefore true globally (in particular it holds regardless of whether event1 happens).
- An implication with a true consequent is always true, so ""if event1 happens then C4"" is true.

Thus C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: from the initial event2 and the alternating rules both events occur infinitely often, so G F C1 holds (C3). Hence F G F C1 (C4) holds (indeed immediately). With the consequent C4 true, the implication ""if event1 happens then C4"" is true."

Short answer: C5 is True (under the usual infinite-trace / next-state semantics). Explanation follows step by step.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.
- Additional constraints: after event1 no further events can occur; likewise after event2 no further events can occur. So a canonical trace is: state0: event1 true; every subsequent state: no events true.

2) Transition rules between events
- There is no transition that produces another event after event1 (or after event2). After the first state where event1 holds, all later states have neither event1 nor event2 true.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" (event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (event1 → (event1 ∨ event2)). This implication is logically valid: whenever event1 is true, event1 ∨ event2 is true; when event1 is false the implication is vacuously true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (globally C2). Since C2 is true in every state (see previous line), C3 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). Because C3 holds in every state, it certainly holds in the next state of any state that has a next.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (F X C3). If C4 holds now (or holds at some future state), then C5 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C2 is a tautological implication, so it holds in every state.
- Therefore C3 (""always C2"") is true.
- Hence in any state with a next state, C4 (""next C3"") is true.
- In particular, at the initial state (which has a next state under the standard model), C4 holds already, so ""eventually C4"" (C5) is true.

Caveat: if you work with a semantics where the initial state is terminal (no next state) and Next is interpreted as false in terminal states, then C4 would be false everywhere and C5 would be false. Under the usual infinite-trace LTL interpretation (or any model with a next state), C5 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true at the start).
- Also given as rules (next step).

Step 2 — transition rules (constraints)
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward (no later occurrences).
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event1 implies that event2 happens later (event1 → event2).

Taken together with the statement that event2 already happened initially, these rules imply event1 cannot have happened (it can’t be earlier than the initial event2, and it can’t happen after event2).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 happens AND event2 happens.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. (Logically: event1 → (event1 ∧ event2). This is equivalent to event1 → event2.)
- C3: C2 holds AND event2 happens. (C2 ∧ event2.)
- C4: event1 happens AND C3 holds. (event1 ∧ C3.)
- C5: C4 does not hold. (¬C4.)

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- event2: true (given).
- event1: false (cannot happen because event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after it).
- C1 = event1 ∧ event2 = false ∧ true = false.
- C2 = (event1 → event2). Since event1 is false, the implication is true (and it also matches the given rule ""after event1, event2 must happen""). So C2 = true.
- C3 = C2 ∧ event2 = true ∧ true = true.
- C4 = event1 ∧ C3 = false ∧ true = false.
- C5 = ¬C4 = ¬false = true.

Conclusion
C5 is True.

(If one allowed simultaneous events or a different temporal interpretation, answers could change; under the natural reading above — event2 occurs initially and blocks any other events afterward — the result is C5 = True.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C5 is True (assuming there is a next state to evaluate).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in any state after the state where event2 happened, neither event1 nor event2 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs at some state, then event2 must occur at some later state). This is an implication; it does not force event1 to occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 does not happen"" (evaluated at the current state).
- C2: ""event2 does not happen"" (same as C1).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" (C2 → event2 at the same state).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" (C1 ∨ C3 at the same state).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4, where X is the next-state operator).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C5?
Evaluate in the initial state (where event2 did happen):
- C1 and C2 are false in the initial state (because event2 does happen).
- C3 is true in the initial state, because its antecedent C2 is false, so (false → anything) is true.
- Therefore C4 is true in the initial state (false ∨ true = true).

Now evaluate C4 in the next state. Because event2 happened in the initial state and “after event2 no other events can happen,” in the next state event2 does not happen. So in the next state:
- C1 and C2 are true (event2 does not happen in that state).
- C3 is false in that state (C2 true but event2 is false there, so C2 → event2 is false).
- C4 = C1 ∨ C3 = true ∨ false = true.

Thus C4 holds in the next state, so C5 is True.

Note on assumptions: this conclusion assumes there is a ""next state"" to evaluate (even if that state contains no events). If your formalism instead treats ""after event2 no next state exists"" so X-operators are undefined or considered false, then C5 would be undefined/false under that alternate semantics.

Answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
So both events are terminal: once either occurs, the system stops and no further events can occur.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — redundantly states that event1 happens (same proposition twice).
- C2: same as C1; it also states that event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e. event1 will hold at some (future) time (event1 will occur at some point).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" — either event1 holds now/at some relevant time, or it will eventually hold.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — neither event1 holds nor will it eventually hold.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Since event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen now or at any later time.
- Therefore C1 is false, C2 is false, C3 is false, and C4 (C1 or C3) is false.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is true.

(If one allowed event1 to have happened before the ""initial"" moment, or interpreted ""happens"" otherwise, conclusions could differ; but under the usual forward-time reading with the given initial state, C5 is True.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 has already happened and both events are terminal, so event1 cannot happen now or later. Thus C1 and C2 are false, C3 (C2 eventually holds) is false, C4 (C1 or C3) is false, and C5 (not C4) is true."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it has already occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. So because event2 happened, event1 will (or does) happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (This makes them alternate, but the single needed consequence is that event1 does happen given the initial event2.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: event1 does not happen. (¬event1)
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens. (C1 → event2)
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens. (C2 ∨ event2)
- C4: event1 does not happen. (same as C1, ¬event1)
- C5: If C3 holds, then C4 holds. (C3 → C4)

4) How they relate and truth-values
- From the context, event2 happened initially, and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” implies event1 does happen. So ¬event1 (C1 and C4) is false.
- C2 (C1 → event2) is vacuously true because C1 is false.
- C3 = (C2 ∨ event2) is true because event2 did happen (and also because C2 is true).
- So we have C3 = True and C4 = False.
- An implication C3 → C4 is false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Therefore C5 is false.

Note: the hypothesis set contains statements (C1/C4) that contradict the context, so the hypothesis is inconsistent with the context; nevertheless, evaluating C5 under the given context yields False.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state reached after event2 is terminal: there are no successor states reachable by any event).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 also leads to a terminal state).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — evaluated in the current (initial) state.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — i.e. in the immediate successor state.
- C3: “Event1 does not happen” — again, evaluated in the current state (same as C1).
- C4: “C2 holds and C3 holds” — both must be true in the current state.
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state” — C4 must be true in the immediate successor state.

Step 4 — relate and evaluate
- In the initial state event2 happened and, by the rule, no further events can occur. So event1 does not happen in the initial state → C1 is true. (Also C3 is the same, so C3 is true.)
- But there is no next state (no successor) after the initial state. Under the usual “next-state” semantics (the operator “next” is true only if a successor exists and the formula holds there), any claim of the form “holds in the next state” is false when there is no successor. Therefore C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is false.
- Since C4 = C2 and C3, and C2 is false, C4 is false in the current state.
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state; there is no next state, so C5 is false.

Conclusion
- Under the standard interpretation where “holds in the next state” requires an actual successor state, C5 is False.

(If you instead adopt a different convention — e.g. implicitly treating the terminal state as having a self-loop so a “next” state exists and is identical — then C2 and C5 would be true. The answer above uses the usual semantic assumption that a next-state assertion is false when no successor exists.)

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., event1 inevitably occurs sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is redundant; it just asserts that event1 happens.
- C2: same as C1 (also asserts event1 happens).
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — since C1 and C2 are the same, C3 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — this says that the statement ""event1 happens"" holds (is true) in the relevant sense at all points considered.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — the negation of C4.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition and transition rules, event1 must occur (it is inevitable after the initial event2).
- Therefore C1 and C2 are true, so C3 is true.
- Interpreting C3 as the global claim ""event1 happens"" (which the rules guarantee), C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

Note on possible ambiguity: If one reads ""Event1 happens"" as a proposition true only at the instantaneous moment of event1 (so it is false before event1 occurs), then C3 would not “always” hold prior to event1 and C4 would be false, making C5 true. But under the natural reading given the statements (""after event2, event1 must happen""), the intended meaning is that event1 inevitably occurs at some point, so C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (it holds at the start).

2) Transition rules:
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the execution becomes terminal once event1 has occurred).

3) What each Ci means (and its truth value):
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True: event2 is true initially and, by the rule, event1 must occur later, so both occur in the trace.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True: since C1 is true (and event1 also happens), the disjunction is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" True: at any point in time
  - if event1 has not yet occurred, the rule guarantees it will occur later, so the proposition ""event1 happens"" (an eventuality) is true from that point;
  - if event1 has occurred, then C1 holds (both happened), so the disjunction is true;
  thus C2 holds at every moment, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False, because we just established C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" False: C4 is false and never becomes true, so it does not eventually hold.

4) How they relate / final conclusion:
- Because the rules force event1 after the initial event2 and then terminate, C1 and C2 are true and remain true at all times, so C3 is true. C4 contradicts C3 and is false, so C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true on the trace (before event1, the rule guarantees event1 will occur, making the ""event1 happens"" disjunct true; after event1, C1 is true, so C2 holds), so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is never true. Therefore C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened.
- Additional facts: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So whichever of event1 or event2 occurs, it is terminal. Because event2 already happened initially, no further events can occur — in particular event1 does not (and cannot) happen.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal events: once either occurs, no other events occur afterwards.
- Since event2 already occurred at the start, event1 cannot occur in the actual scenario.

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: (event1 → event2) — if event1 happens then event2 happens.
- C2: (event1 → C1) — if event1 happens then the statement C1 holds. Logically, C2 is equivalent to C1 (A → (A → B) is equivalent to A → B).
- C3: (C2 → event1) — if C2 holds then event1 happens.
- C4: (event1 → event2) — same as C1.
- C5: (C3 → C4) — if C3 holds then C4 holds.

4) How they relate / truth evaluation
- Let E1 := ""event1 happens"", E2 := ""event2 happens"".
- From the scenario: E2 = True, E1 = False (because after E2 no other events can happen).
- Evaluate:
  - C1 = (E1 → E2). With E1 = False this implication is vacuously True.
  - C4 is identical to C1, so C4 = True.
  - C2 = (E1 → C1). With E1 = False this is True.
  - C3 = (C2 → E1). With C2 = True and E1 = False this is False.
  - C5 = (C3 → C4). With C3 = False and C4 = True, the implication is True (false antecedent → anything is True).

Therefore C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 were to happen, event1 must also happen (at some point after it). Given the first rule and the initial condition, event2 cannot occur at any time.

3) Meaning of the C-conditions
- C1: event2 happens AND event1 happens.
- C2: event2 happens AND event1 happens. (C2 is identical to C1.)
- C3: C2 does not hold (i.e., ¬C2).
- C4: If C1 holds then C3 holds (i.e., C1 → C3).
- C5: C4 eventually holds (i.e., at some time in the future C4 is true).

4) How they relate and truth values
- event1 has happened, and no further events can happen, so event2 never happens.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false (event2 does not happen).
- C3 = ¬C2 is true (since C2 is false).
- C4 is (C1 → C3). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true. (Note also logically C1 → ¬C1 is equivalent to ¬C1, so C4 simply says C1 does not hold, which is true.)
- C5 asserts that C4 eventually holds. C4 already holds now, so C5 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (call that state s0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. (If current state has event1, the next state has event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. (If current state has event2, the next state has event1.)
- Together these force an alternation: s0 (event2), s1 (event1), s2 (event2), s3 (event1), … infinitely alternating.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Interpreted at the current state, C1 is true iff the immediately following state contains event1.
  - At the initial state s0 (which has event2), C1 is true because the rule ""after event2 → event1"" makes s1 contain event1.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This means: at some (current or future) point along the run, C1 is true. Since C1 already holds at s0, C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2 (you listed the same statement twice). So C3 is also true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" This is the disjunction of the two previous facts.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because the initial state s0 has event2 and the rules force alternation, C1 is true at s0.
- Therefore C2 (eventually C1) is true (it holds immediately), and C3 is true as well.
- Consequently C4 = (C2 or C3) is true.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has happened (which it did initially), no occurrence of event2 is possible at any later time.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.
- Rule B: If event1 happens, then no other events can happen afterwards.
Because event1 already happened initially and blocks any further events, event2 cannot occur (there is no time left after the initial event1 for event2 to happen).

Step 3 — meaning of C1, C2, C3, C4
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens” — this is just the proposition “event2 happens” (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: C1 does not hold — i.e., “event2 does not happen.”
- C3: C1 does not hold — same as C2, “event2 does not happen.”
- C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds — i.e., “if event2 does not happen, then event2 does not happen.”

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- From the context, event2 cannot happen, so C1 is false and C2 and C3 are both true.
- C4 is the implication (not C1) → (not C1), which is a tautology (always true), and in the given situation its antecedent and consequent are both true.

Short answer: C5 is False (under the usual reading where events are instantaneous and ""eventually"" looks only at the current/future states).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 has occurred (the initial state contains the occurrence of event2).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur in any later state.
- Rule B: once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur in any later state.
(So an occurrence of either event blocks any future occurrences of any events.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (formally F event2 — there is some time ≥ the current time at which event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (formally X F event2 — in the immediate successor state, event2 will occur at some time ≥ that successor state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X X F event2), and similarly
- C4 = X^3 F event2, C5 = X^4 F event2.

4) How do these conditions relate and how do we evaluate them?
- Evaluate C1 at the initial state: true, because event2 already occurred in the initial state (F allows the current state).
- Consider C2 at the immediate successor state: by the rules, after event2 occurred there are no further events, so in that successor state there is no occurrence of event2 at any time ≥ that successor state. Therefore F event2 is false at the successor state, so C2 is false.
- Because C2 is false at the successor, C3 (which asserts that C2 holds in the next state) is false in the initial state, and by the same reasoning C4 and C5 are false.

Conclusion: C1 is true; C2, C3, C4, C5 are all false. Therefore C5 is False.

Note on an alternative interpretation: if ""event2 happened"" instead set a persistent proposition that remains true in all future states (i.e., event2 is treated as a lasting fact rather than a one-time instantaneous occurrence), then C1 would remain true in all later states and C2–C5 would be true. The above conclusion assumes the common view that events are instantaneous occurrences and ""eventually"" looks forward from the current state.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs only in the initial state (not persistently), so in the immediate successor state there is no future occurrence of event2; hence X^4 F event2 (C5) is false."

Short answer: C4 is False (under the usual interpretation of ""happens"" as an occurrence at a time point and ""always"" as the temporal ""globally"" operator). Explanation step by step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the start.
- Also given: after event2 no other events can happen; after event1 no other events can happen. So each event is terminal/absorbing.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event2 happens, the system stops (no further events).
- If event1 happens, the system stops.
- Since event2 happens initially, there are no subsequent events at all in the actual run.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice; effectively C1 = ""event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — interpreted as the temporal/global statement ""at all times from now on, C1 is true.""
- C3: same as C2 (duplicate).
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" — equivalently ""C1 always holds"" (since both conjuncts are the same).

4) How the conditions relate and truth values
- At the initial moment C1 is true (event2 did happen).
- But C2 asserts that C1 holds at every time point from now on. Interpreting ""happens"" as an instantaneous occurrence at a time point, at later times ""event2 happens"" is false (it happened in the past but does not happen again). Therefore C2 is false. Likewise C3 is false.
- Since C4 = C2 ∧ C3, C4 is false.

Note on alternate readings: If you instead interpret ""C1"" to mean ""event2 has occurred (ever)"" so that it remains true after the occurrence, then C1 would remain true and C2/C3/C4 would be true. But with the usual instantaneous reading of ""happens"" and the usual meaning of ""always"" (globally), C4 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial moment).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
Given event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to “event1 happens” (true in the given initial state).
- C2: same as C1, so also true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — reads as “C2 holds at all times.” Whether this is true can depend on how you interpret persistence of the fact “event1 happens,” but this detail will turn out to be irrelevant for C5.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" — a conditional whose truth depends on whether C3 holds whenever C1 does.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"" — a conditional with antecedent “event2 happens.”

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer about C5
- In the actual scenario event2 does not (and cannot) happen because event1 happened initially and prevents further events.
- In classical logic an implication ""If P then Q"" is true whenever P is false. Here P is ""event2 happens,"" which is false in the scenario, so the implication is vacuously true regardless of the truth of Q (C4).
- Therefore C5 is True. (This conclusion does not rely on whether C3 or C4 are true in themselves.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 does not (and cannot) happen, so the antecedent of ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"" is false; the implication is vacuously true."

Short answer: C5 is True (under the usual interpretation of ""happens"" and ""eventually"").

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened.
- Transition rules (given separately): after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no further events occur.

2) Transition rules between events
- Once event2 has happened, event1 will occur afterwards (so the timeline is event2 → event1 → stop).
- After event1 occurs nothing else can happen.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — logically equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — the implication C1 → event2. Because C1 is equivalent to event2, this is either tautological or at least true here (consequent event2 is true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some time (now or later) when C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — a disjunction; true if either C3 is true or event1 occurs.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — there exists some time (now or later) when C4 is true.

4) How they relate (truth propagation)
- C1 is true because event2 already happened.
- C2 is true: given event2 is true, the implication C1 → event2 holds (either because its consequent is true or because antecedent equals consequent).
- C3 is true: C2 already holds now, so ""eventually C2"" is satisfied.
- C4 is true: C3 is true, so C3 ∨ event1 is true regardless of whether event1 has occurred yet.
- C5 is true: C4 already holds now, so ""eventually C4"" is satisfied.

Therefore C5 is True.

Note on assumptions: this reasoning assumes the usual temporal reading where ""event happens"" is true at the time it occurs (and we count the current time as satisfying ""eventually""). If your formal semantics require ""eventually"" to mean strictly in the future (not including the present) and C2 holds only at the present instant and never again, you would need to check whether C2 will hold at a strictly later time; under the narrative (event2 then event1 then stop) C2 will still hold because it depends on event2 which occurred. Under typical interpretations there is no issue and C5 is true.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start of the trace).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Combining these with the initial condition gives the only possible finite trace: event2 occurs, then (later) event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e., at least one of the two events occurs in the trace.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — whenever event1 occurs, it implies (event1 or event2) holds. This implication is trivially true whenever event1 occurs.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 is true at every point in the trace (so C3 is true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 holds at all times, it holds at some time as well; so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens"" — conjunction of C4 and the fact that event2 occurs.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the trace: event2 occurs and event1 also occurs later. Therefore C1 is satisfied (indeed both events occur).
- C2 is true (implication holds whenever event1 occurs).
- C3 is true because C2 is always true.
- C4 is true because C3 being always true implies it is true eventually.
- C5 is the conjunction of C4 (true) and ""event2 happens"" (true because event2 occurred initially). Hence C5 is True.

Note: This conclusion assumes the usual reading that ""happens"" means ""occurs at some point in the trace"" and that the temporal statements are interpreted over the single trace described.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reasoning (brief):
- States: 0 (initial): event2. By the rules events alternate: state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...
- C1 and C2: ""event1 in the next state"" — at state0 this is true (state1 has event1).
- C3 = C1 or C2 — true whenever C1 (or C2) is true.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" = two-step statement: XX(event1). At state k, C4 is true iff event1 holds at k+2. Because events alternate, C4 is true exactly at odd states.
- C5 = (C4 -> event1). At any state k where C4 is true, k is odd, and event1 also holds at k. Wherever C4 is false the implication is vacuously true. Therefore the implication holds in every state.

So C5 is True."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (in the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- Rule B: If event2 happens, no other events can happen after it (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 already happened initially, Rule B forbids any further events after the initial state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “event1 happens in the next state” (i.e. immediately after the initial state).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e. event1 does not happen in the next state).
- C3: “C2 holds and event1 happens” (both C1 false and event1 happens) — a conjunction that requires event1 to happen.
- C4: “C3 holds and event2 happens” (requires C3 and also event2 happens).
- C5: “C4 does not hold” (i.e. C4 is false).

4) How these conditions relate and final evaluation
- From Rule B and the initial fact that event2 already happened, no events can occur after the initial state. Therefore event1 cannot happen in the next state → C1 is false.
- C2 is “C1 does not hold” → C2 is true.
- C3 requires event1 to happen (and C2); since event1 cannot happen, C3 is false.
- C4 requires C3 (and event2); since C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5 is “C4 does not hold” → C5 is true.

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpreted as: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will (eventually) occur. Formally: event1 ⇒ event2.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will (eventually) occur. Formally: event2 ⇒ event1.
(These two rules produce a mutual liveness: occurrences force the other to occur, e.g. an alternating sequence 1,2,1,2,… is consistent with them.)

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. This matches the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" so C1 holds.
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds. Since C1 holds (from above), C2 is true (an OR is true if one disjunct is true).
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens. We have C2 true and the initial condition says event1 happened, so C3 is true now.
- C4: C3 eventually holds. Because C3 already holds now, ""eventually C3 holds"" is true.
- C5: event1 happens or C4 holds. Event1 happens now and C4 holds, so C5 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 is derived directly from the transition rule ""after event1, event2 must happen.""
- C2 uses C1 as one disjunct, so C1 being true makes C2 true regardless of whether event2 has yet occurred.
- C3 combines C2 with the initial fact that event1 happened, so C3 is true immediately.
- C4 is the temporal lifting of C3 (""eventually C3""); since C3 is already true, C4 is true.
- C5 is then true because at least one disjunct (in fact both) is true.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 already happened initially, the system is already in the terminal state and no further events can occur.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., event2 never occurs)
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (at some future point the statement C2 is true)
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" (implication C1 → C3)
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" (C4 ∨ event2)

4) How the conditions relate; evaluation
- From the initial condition, event2 did happen. Therefore the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" (C1 and C2) is false.
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" is false too: since event2 has already occurred, the claim ""event2 does not happen"" cannot become true later.
- C4 is the implication (C1 → C3). An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Since C1 is false, C4 is true.
- C5 = (C4 ∨ event2). Both disjuncts are actually true: C4 is true (vacuously) and event2 happened is true from the initial condition. Therefore C5 is true.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened at the initial time.
- From ""After event2, no other events can happen"" we know event2 is terminal: once it has happened, no further events may occur.
- From ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we know any occurrence of event1 would require event2 to occur afterward.

2) Transition rules between events (rephrased)
- If event2 has occurred at some time then no event (including event1) can occur at any strictly later time.
- If event1 occurs at some time then event2 must occur at the same or a later time (but that is irrelevant if event2 already occurred earlier and prevents later events).

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — i.e. event1 never occurs at any time.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — formally: event1 → (¬event1). This implication is equivalent to ¬event1 (an implication p → ¬p is true exactly when p is false).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some time (now or later) at which C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — at every time, C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens"" — both C4 is true and event2 occurs (somewhen).

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal, no events can ever occur after that initial moment. Therefore event1 never happens. So C1 is True.
- Given C1 is True, the implication in C2 (event1 → ¬event1) is true (either vacuously or because ¬event1 is true). So C2 is True (in fact true at all times).
- If C2 is true now (and always), then ""C2 eventually holds"" is true (C3 is true).
- If C3 is true now (and at every time, because C2 is always true) then ""C3 always holds"" is true (C4 is true).
- Finally, event2 did happen (initially) and C4 holds, so C5 (C4 and event2) is True.

Therefore C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurred initially and is terminal, so event1 never happens (C1 true). That makes C2 (event1 → ¬event1) true, hence C3 and C4 hold, and since event2 did happen, C5 (C4 and event2) is true."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Thus the sequence of events alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (so event1 occurs now and repeatedly thereafter).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (True here — it already happened and will occur again.)
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (Same as C1; True.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (Negation of C2.)
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" (C1 → C3.)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (Negation of C4.)

4) How they relate / truth evaluation
- From the alternation, event1 does happen, so C1 = True and C2 = True.
- C3 = not C2 = not True = False.
- C4 is the material implication C1 → C3. With C1 = True and C3 = False, the implication is False (T → F = F). So C4 = False.
- C5 = not C4 = not False = True.

Therefore C5 is True (given ordinary classical logic and the stated transition rules; the result is robust whether ""eventually"" includes the present instant or means some later time, since event1 recurs).

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so the initial state satisfies event2 and not event1).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen: the immediate successor of any state where event2 holds is a state where event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen: a state where event1 holds has no successor (or has no further events). So the only possible trace consistent with the rules is: initial state with event2 → next state with event1 → end.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the implication event1 → event1, which is a tautology (always true) in any state where implication is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether, in the immediate successor state, C1 is true.
- C3: Same as C1 (again the tautology event1 → event1).
- C4: C2 ∧ C3.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — there exists some state now or in the future where C4 is true (standard LTL F C4).

4) How the conditions evaluate and relate
- At the initial state: event2 is true, event1 is false.
  - C1 (event1 → event1) is true (false → false is true).
  - The next state exists and is the event1 state; in that next state C1 is also true. So C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true at the initial state.
  - C3 is the same tautology and is true at the initial state.
  - Therefore C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is true at the initial state.
- C5 says C4 eventually holds. Since C4 already holds in the initial state, ""eventually C4"" is true (eventually includes the current state in the usual temporal logic semantics).

Minor note on semantics: if you use a semantics where X (next) is false at a terminal state, then C2 might be false when evaluated at the event1 (terminal) state. That does not matter here because C4 already holds at the initial state, so C5 is still true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event1 holds.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — interpret as: whenever event1 holds in a state, event2 holds in the next state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 holds in a state, event1 holds in the next state.
These two rules force an alternation: starting with event1 at t0, the trace is
t0: event1
t1: event2
t2: event1
t3: event2
… and so on.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just event2 ∧ event2, i.e. equivalently event2. C1 holds in any state where event2 is true (t1, t3, ...).
- C2: same as C1 (redundant).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — i.e. at some state now-or-later (or strictly later, either interpretation below) C2 (event2) is true. From any state in the alternating trace there is an occurrence of event2 (t1, t3, ...), so C3 is true in all states.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" — the implication C1 → C3. This is true in any state where either C1 is false or C3 is true; it can only fail if C1 is true and C3 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X C4, evaluated at the initial state means C4 must be true at t1.

4) Evaluation and relation of conditions
- At t0: C1 is false (event2 does not hold), C3 is true (because event2 occurs at t1), so C4 = (C1 → C3) is vacuously true at t0.
- At t1: C1 is true (event2 holds). Is C3 true at t1? Yes — event2 holds at t1 (so ""eventually event2"" is satisfied immediately), and even if ""eventually"" were interpreted as strictly later, there is another event2 at t3, so C3 still holds. Therefore at t1 the implication C1 → C3 is true. Hence C4 holds at t1.
- Since C4 holds at t1, C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"", evaluated at t0) is true.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state 0) event1 happens.

A simple timeline consistent with the description:
- state 0: event1 happens.
- state 1: because after event1 event2 must happen, event2 happens.
- state 2 onward: after event2 no other events can happen, so no events occur in these states.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs in some state, then in the next state event2 must occur.
- If event2 occurs in some state, then in all subsequent states no events occur (event2 is a terminal event in this run).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., event1 is false in the current state.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e., in every state, event1 does not happen — equivalently event1 never happens anywhere.)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e., either event1 never happens at all, or event1 holds in the current state.)
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" (i.e., in the immediately following state, either event1 never happens everywhere, or event1 happens in that next state.)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (i.e., in every state, the next state satisfies C3.)

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluation on the run
Evaluate them on the actual run described above:

- C1 at state 0: false (because event1 happens in state 0).
- C2: false (because C1 is false at state 0, so it is not true that event1 never happens).
- C3 at state 0: C2 or event1 = false or true = true. So C3 is true at state 0.
- C4 at state 0: C3 must hold in the next state (state 1). In state 1, C2 is still false (we already saw C2 is globally false), so C3 at state 1 reduces to ""event1 happens in state 1"". But in state 1 event2 happens (by the rules) and event1 does not happen. Therefore C3 is false in state 1. Hence C4 is false at state 0.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" is therefore false, because C4 is false at the initial state (and so not true in all states).

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: In the actual run state0 has event1, so C2 (event1 never occurs) is false. Then in state1 event2 occurs and event1 does not, so C3 is false in state1, making C4 false at state0. Hence C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the timeline is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: Event1 eventually happens.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" (disjunction).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (i.e., at all times C3 is true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold.""

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the rules, event1 does eventually happen (because event2 happened and forces event1). So C1 = True.
- C2 = (event2 happens) OR (C1). Both disjuncts are true here (event2 did happen and C1 is true), so C2 = True.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" → since C2 is True, C3 = False.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds"" → since C3 is already False, C4 = False.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold"" → since C4 is False, C5 = True.

Therefore C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 has occurred so event1 must occur, making C1 true. Thus C2 is true, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false. Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false, and C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).
- Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — so once event1 has happened (and it has, initially), no future occurrence of any event (including event2) is possible.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That constrains what must follow if event2 ever occurs, but it only matters if event2 can occur.
- Given the initial event1 and the rule that no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time. So event2 never happens in this scenario.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2: same as C1, so also equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" → equivalently, ""event2 does not happen"".
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" → C3 is true at every point in time (global/always).
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds"" → (event2 happens) OR (C3 always holds).

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial conditions, event2 cannot happen, so C1 is false and C2 is false.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
- Because event2 never happens at any time, C3 is true at all times, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.
- C5 is C1 ∨ C4 = false ∨ true = true.

Assumptions (make-or-break): I read this as a simple discrete-time/event temporal system where:
- “EventX happens” means “EventX occurs at the current step/time.”
- “Always” means “at every step from now on (globally).”
If you meant a different temporal meaning (e.g., “eventually” or “has happened at some time”), tell me and I’ll re-evaluate.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial step t0, event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs at some step, event1 must occur at the next step.
- After event1 occurs at some step, event2 must occur at the next step.
So the system forces alternation: ... → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “event1 happens or event2 happens.” At a given step, at least one of the two events occurs.
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” At a given step, at least one event occurs AND event2 occurs (equivalently: event2 occurs at that step).
- C3: “C2 always holds.” For every step, C2 is true (i.e., event2 occurs at every step).
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” It is not the case that event2 occurs at every step.
- C5: “C4 always holds.” At every step, C3 does not hold (i.e., at every step it remains true that event2 does not occur at every step).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation step-by-step
- At t0 (initial): event2 happened.
  - C1 is true at t0 (event2 happens ⇒ event1 or event2 holds).
  - C2 is true at t0 (C1 true AND event2 happens).
- At t1 (next step): by the rule, event1 must happen.
  - C1 is true at t1 (event1 happens).
  - C2 is false at t1 (event2 does not happen at t1).
- At t2: event2 happens again, so C2 true at t2, false at t1, true at t0, etc.

Therefore:
- C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false: C2 is not true at every step (it is false at the steps when event1 occurs).
- C4 (“C3 does not hold”) is true (because C3 is false).
- Is C4 always true? Yes: the pattern of alternation makes it impossible for C2 to be true at every step, so C3 remains false at every step. Thus C4 is true at every step.
- Consequently C5 (“C4 always holds”) is true.

Answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it occurs at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

From these rules we get a single deterministic timeline: event1 occurs initially, then event2 occurs later, and nothing happens after event2.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Interpreted as the claim that at least one of the two events occurs in the run.
- C2: identical to C1.
- C3: C1 and C2 both hold (so C3 is just the conjunction of two identical true statements).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 is true in the system/run at all relevant points (i.e., it is a global fact).
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — either the global fact C4 is true, or event1 happens.

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the scenario, both event1 and event2 occur in the run, so C1 is true (and therefore C2 is true). Thus C3 is true.
- Because C1 and C2 are true for the run, C3 is always true in this system, so C4 is true.
- C5 is a disjunction: C4 OR event1. Since C4 is true, C5 is true (the disjunction is true regardless of the other disjunct).

Note on ambiguity: If one instead read ""happens"" as ""happens right now"" and ""always"" as ""at every instantaneous state,"" the truth values could vary over time. Under the usual interpretation here (events occur at some time in the run and C4 is a global property), C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Since event2 happened initially and is terminal, no further events (in particular event1) can ever occur in this run.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (This is false in the actual run because event1 never occurs.)
- C2: same as C1 (""Event1 eventually happens."") — also false.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Formally: (event1 happens) → (event1 eventually happens). This implication is true: vacuously true in this run (the antecedent never holds), and logically true in general because if event1 happens at some time then event1 does indeed eventually happen.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" That is (C1) → (C3). In the actual run C1 is false, so C4 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Means C4 holds at every point/state along the execution.

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluation of C5?
- C1 and C2 are false. C3 is true (vacuously). C4 is true (vacuously, because C1 is false).
- Since no events can occur after the initial event2, the run has no state where C1 becomes true, so C4 remains true at every point of the run.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.
- Also given: after event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).

2) Transition rules between events
- If event2 happens then event1 must happen afterwards.
- If event1 happens then no further events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no future event (including event2) can ever occur.

3) What each Ci means (plain reading)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (i.e., event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there is some future time at which C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (at every time, C2 is true).
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"" (the implication: event1 ⇒ C3).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (there is some time in the future at which C4 is true).

4) How they relate (reasoning)
- From the initial condition plus ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event2 cannot occur at any time. So C1 is true (event2 never happens).
- If C1 is already true now, then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is true (it holds immediately).
- If C1 holds at all times, then for every time point the statement ""eventually C1"" holds, so C3 (C2 always holds) is true.
- Given C3 is true and event1 happens, the implication ""if event1 happens then C3"" (C4) is true.
- Because C4 already holds now, ""C4 eventually holds"" (C5) is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

(If one allowed the possibility that event2 had already happened before the initial moment, or that “event1 happens” was intended as a future occurrence rather than the given initial occurrence, the answer could change; with the stated initial event1 and the rule that no events can occur after it, the chain above makes C5 true.)

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0), event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After any state where event1 happens, the next state must have event2.
- After any state where event2 happens, the next state must have event1.
So the system forces alternation: s0 has event1, s1 must have event2, s2 must have event1, s3 event2, and so on.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e., at the current state at least one of the two events holds.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — at the current state neither event1 nor event2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — for every future state, the next state has neither event1 nor event2 (equivalently, from now on C2 is true at every state).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — it is not the case that C3 always holds.

4) How the conditions relate (and evaluation)
- From the alternation trace: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...
- Therefore at every state at least one of event1 or event2 holds, so C1 is true in every state.
- Hence C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false in every state.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false in every state.
- Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold"": since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state 0) event1 is true.

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: whenever event1 is true in some state, event2 is true in the next state. (Formally: event1 → X event2.)
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: whenever event2 is true in some state, event1 is true in the next state. (Formally: event2 → X event1.)
- Together these force an alternating pattern: from event1 you must go to a state with event2, and from event2 you must go to a state with event1.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens"" — i.e. event1 ∨ event2 holds in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. ¬(event1 ∨ event2) in the current state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e. X C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e. F C3 (there exists some future state where C3 holds).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — i.e. ¬F C3.

4) How these relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition and the transition rules we get this infinite sequence of states:  
  state0: event1 true  
  state1: event2 true  
  state2: event1 true  
  state3: event2 true  
  ... and so on (alternation).
- In every state at least one of event1 or event2 is true, so C1 is true in every state.
- Therefore C2 (= ""C1 does not hold"") is false in every state.
- C3 (= ""C2 in the next state"") is false in every state (since C2 is always false).
- C4 (= ""eventually C3"") is false (C3 never becomes true).
- C5 (= ""C4 does not hold"") is true (because C4 is false).

So C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True (given the usual reading below). Now the step-by-step analysis.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the initial moment.
- Additional system facts: once event2 has happened, no other events can occur thereafter. Also, if event1 ever happens, event2 must happen afterwards.

2) Transition rules / dynamics
- Because event2 happened initially and “after event2 no other events can happen,” there are no further event occurrences possible from the initial state.
- The rule “after event1, event2 must happen” only matters if event1 ever occurs; in this model it cannot occur after the initial event2 because no further events are possible.

3) What each sub-condition means (and truth now)
Interpret “X happens” as “X occurs (at some time) / the fact X has occurred.” Under that reading:

- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” True — event2 already happened.
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” False — event1 does not happen, so the conjunction is false (C1 is true but event1 is false).
- C3: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” Same as C1, so True.
- C4: “C2 holds or C3 holds.” True, because C3 is true.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” True — C4 already holds now, so it certainly holds “eventually.”

4) How the conditions relate to each other
- C1 and C3 are the same; they are satisfied by the already-happened event2.
- C2 would require event1 to happen; it does not, so C2 is false.
- Because C3 is true, C4 is true regardless of C2.
- Since C4 is true at the initial moment, C5 (“C4 eventually holds”) is true.

Caveats / alternative readings
- If you interpret “event2 happens” as true only at the single instant of occurrence (not as a persistent past fact), and if “eventually” is required to mean “at some strictly later time” (excluding the current instant), you should check whether C4 remains true at those later times. Under the stated system “after event2 no other events can happen,” there are no events later, but the truth of C3 at later times depends on whether “event2 happened” is a persistent proposition. The common, natural reading for “event2 happened” + “after event2 no other events can happen” is that event2 has happened and that fact is persistent, so the conclusion above (C5 true) holds. If you intended a different temporal semantics, tell me which and I’ll redo the evaluation.

I’ll answer the four numbered sub-questions step by step, then evaluate C5.

Assumption I use: “always” means “in every state (globally)”. If you meant something else (e.g., “infinitely often” or “eventually always”) say so and I’ll re-evaluate.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at time/state 0: event1 is true, event2 is false).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen next. So if event1 holds at state n, then event2 holds at state n+1.
- After event2, event1 must happen next. So if event2 holds at state n, then event1 holds at state n+1.
- Together these rules force an alternating sequence of events over time: state 0: event1, state 1: event2, state 2: event1, state 3: event2, … and so on forever.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (using “always” = globally)
- C1: “Event2 always happens” — event2 is true in every state.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens” — C1 is true and event1 is true in the current state.
- C3: “C2 always holds” — C2 is true in every state.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” — at the next state, C3 is true.
- C5: “C4 does not hold” — C4 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
Evaluate on the timeline produced by the transition rules:

- C1 (event2 true in every state)? No. At the initial state (state 0) event1 is true and event2 is false. So C1 is false.
- C2 (C1 and event1 at state 0)? C1 is already false, so C2 is false (even though event1 is true).
- C3 (C2 true in every state)? C2 is false at state 0, so C3 is false.
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state)? C3 is false in every state, so C4 is false.
- C5 (C4 does not hold)? Since C4 is false, the statement “C4 does not hold” is true.

Conclusion: Under the natural reading above, C5 is True.

Note on alternate readings: If by “always” you meant “infinitely often” (i.e., occurs repeatedly, not in every state), then event2 does occur infinitely often and C1 would be true in that sense, which would change the truth of C2–C5. Tell me which formal meaning of “always” you intend if you want the alternate analysis.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: With ""always"" = globally, event2 is false at the initial state, so C1 is false, hence C2 and C3 are false, so C4 is false; therefore ""C4 does not hold"" (C5) is true."

Short answers up front: the only events are event1 and event2; initially event2 has happened and both events are terminal (once either happens nothing more can happen). Evaluating the chain gives: C1 true, C2 true, C3 true, C4 false, and therefore C5 true (because event2 happened). Below is the step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Additional condition: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. Because event2 already happened, the trace contains event2 and then nothing else; event1 does not occur in this trace.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal events: once one occurs, no further events can occur.
- Since event2 already occurred at the start, no further events (including event1) can occur afterwards.

3) What each sub-condition means (and its truth value in this trace)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (event1 ⇒ event2). In our trace event1 never occurs, so the implication is vacuously true. Conclusion: C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Standardly ""eventually"" means ""at some time now or in the future."" C1 already holds now, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C2 true and event2 did happen), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 holds, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" The disjunction is true because event2 did happen. So C5 is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- From the situation (no event1, event2 already happened) we get C1 true ⇒ C2 true ⇒ C3 true ⇒ C4 false. Independently, event2 having happened makes any disjunction that includes ""event2 happens"" true; in particular C5 = (C4 holds) ∨ (event2 happens) is true because event2 happened.

Final answer: C5 is True.

(Note: this uses the usual interpretation that an implication with a false antecedent is true, and that ""eventually"" includes the present moment. If you use a different temporal convention—e.g., ""eventually"" means strictly later than now—C2 would still be true here because C1 is a static truth about the trace; but if you have another formalization in mind, say so and I’ll adapt the reasoning.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (it occurred initially).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event2 → event1, interpreted temporally as: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → event2). Together these give an alternation: event2 implies a later event1, which implies a later event2, etc.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just event2 (a redundant disjunction). So C1 asserts that event2 occurs.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Formally C1 → event1. Given C1 ≡ event2, this says event2 → event1, which matches the given transition rule.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" This is (C2) ∨ (event2). It is true if either the implication C2 is true or event2 occurs.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That means at some point (now or in the future) C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" Conjunction: C4 ∧ event2.

4) How the conditions relate and truth evaluation
- From the initial condition, event2 is true, so C1 is true.
- With C1 true and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", C2 is true (and it entails that event1 will happen after event2).
- Since event2 is true and C2 is true, their disjunction C3 is true immediately.
- Because C3 is already true, ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is true.
- Finally, C5 = C4 ∧ event2. Both conjuncts are true (C4 true, event2 true), so C5 is true.

Notes:
- C1 was redundant (E2 ∨ E2).
- The alternation rules guarantee repeated occurrences of both events, so any existential/“eventually” claims about C3/C4 are satisfied.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.
- Also given: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. That means once either event1 or event2 has occurred, the system has no further events in all subsequent states.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: if either happens, the future is frozen (no further events occur).
- In particular, because event2 already happened initially, there are no possible transitions that produce any new events (including event1) in any future state.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (i.e., event1 occurs in the immediate successor state.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (conjunction; requires event1 now and C1 true)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (there exists some future state where C2 is true)
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" (in the immediate successor state, C3 is true)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (negation of C4)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 requires event1 and C1; with C1 false (and event1 not occurring), C2 is false.
- C3 says C2 will hold at some future point. Because the system is stuck (no further events ever happen), C2 will never become true, so C3 is false.
- C4 asserts that C3 is true in the next state; since C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" Because C4 is false, C5 is true.

Thus, C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initial state) event1 holds.

A possible infinite run consistent with the rules: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … (they alternate).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen in the next state.
So the system alternates between event1 and event2 on successive states.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
Interpreting the English using standard temporal operators:
- C1: (event1 → event1). This is a propositional implication P→P (with P = event1).
- C2: always C1 (usually written G(C1) ) — C1 holds in every state.
- C3: C2 holds in the next state (X C2).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (X C3 = X^2 C2).
- C5: C4 holds in the next state (X C4 = X^3 C2).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is their truth value?
- C1 is a tautology: P→P is true in every state, regardless of whether P is true or false in that state.
- Therefore C2 = G(C1) is true (C1 holds in every state).
- Since C2 holds in every state, X C2 (C3) is true at the current state (because C2 holds in the next state).
- Repeating the same reasoning, X^2 C2 (C4) and X^3 C2 (C5) are also true.

Thus C5 is True. (This conclusion only relies on interpreting the statements in ordinary linear-time temporal logic; if “always” or “next” were intended in some nonstandard sense, the reasoning would need to be adapted.)

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, there are no further states/transitions from the initial state; event1 never occurs in any reachable execution.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (A conditional about occurrences of events.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (Globally: in every reachable state/execution C1 is true.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (There is some future state where C2 is true.)
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" (In the immediate successor state, C3 holds.)
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" (Implication from C4 to occurrence of event2.)

Clarifying semantics used:
- An implication ""P => Q"" is true whenever P is false (vacuous truth).
- The next-state operator is false at a state with no successor (terminal state).

4) How these conditions relate and what they evaluate to
- C1: true. There is no reachable situation where event1 happens without event2; in fact event1 never happens, so the implication is vacuously true.
- C2: true. C1 holds in the initial (and only) reachable state, so ""always C1"" holds.
- C3: true. Since C2 already holds now, ""eventually C2"" is satisfied.
- C4: false. C4 requires a next state in which C3 holds, but there is no next state (initial state is terminal), so ""next C3"" is false.
- C5: true. C5 is the implication C4 => event2. Because C4 is false, the implication is true (vacuous truth). (Separately, event2 already happened initially, but that is not needed for the vacuous-truth argument.)

Conclusion: C5 evaluates to True.

Answering step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it occurred initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e. whenever event1 happens, event2 will happen later).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. whenever event2 happens, event1 will happen later).
Together with the initial event2, this implies an alternation: event2 (initial) ⇒ event1 (later) ⇒ event2 (later) ⇒ ... so both events will occur (infinitely often, under the liveness interpretation).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is just a redundant disjunction; it reduces to ""event1 happens"" (i.e. event1 occurs at some point).
- C2: same as C1, so also ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is ""event1 happens,"" C3 says ""event1 happens at some (possibly later) time.""
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" So C4 is true if either event2 occurs (at some point) or C3 (i.e. event1 eventually occurs) holds.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" An implication: C1 ⇒ C4.

4) How do these conditions relate and is C5 true?
- From the initial event2 and the transition rules, event1 will happen (because after event2, event1 must happen). Therefore C1 and C2 (""event1 happens"") are true.
- Since C2 holds (indeed holds now/inevitably), C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true.
- Event2 happened initially, so event2 happens is true; therefore C4 (""event2 happens or C3"") is true (in fact true for either reason).
- C5 is the implication ""if C1 then C4"". We have C1 true and C4 true, so the implication is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

(If you intended different temporal semantics for ""happens"" or ""after"" — e.g. insisting on strict time indices, or requiring “happens now” vs “eventually” — state that and I can re-evaluate. Under the usual reading that ""after X, Y must happen"" means Y eventually follows X, the above holds.)

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some point after the initial state).
- After event1, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the actual timeline (given the rules) is: event2 has already happened, event1 will happen sometime after that, and then nothing else happens.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is true now because event2 has already happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 already holds, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" C2 becomes true when event1 occurs (it may not hold yet in the initial state).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This is equivalent to ""event1 eventually happens."" Given the rule that after event2 event1 must happen, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 means event1 eventually happens, so C3 ⇒ event1 is true; thus C4 holds.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the implication C4 ⇒ event1.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- We already know event1 does in fact happen (by the rule “after event2, event1 must happen”). Therefore the consequent of C5 is true.
- An implication with a true consequent is true, so C5 is true.
(Also: C4 is true as shown above, but you do not need C4 to be false/true to conclude C5 once you know event1 happens — the truth of the consequent alone makes C5 true.)

Therefore C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: given ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and event2 has already happened, event1 does occur in the run. Therefore the consequent of C5 (""event1 happens"") is true, so the implication C5 (C4 ⇒ event1) is true."

Short answer: C5 is True (in fact a tautology). Below is the step-by-step breakdown you requested.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (call it E) and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen. So given the initial event2, event1 will occur (E is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What each sub-condition means (using E = ""event1 happens"")
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" ≡ E (duplicate conjuncts do not change meaning).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ ¬E.
- C3: same as C1 ≡ E.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" ≡ (¬E) → E.
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds"" ≡ E → ((¬E) → E).

4) How these relate and evaluation of C5
- Simplify C4: (¬E) → E is logically equivalent to E. (Because (¬E)→E = ¬(¬E) ∨ E = E ∨ E = E.)
- Therefore C5 becomes E → C4 ≡ E → E, which is always true (a tautology).
- Independently, the scenario's rules make E true anyway (event2 → event1), so C5 certainly holds in the scenario. But the stronger point is that C5 is true logically in all cases.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True (vacuously), given the premises.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur after that point.
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (This rule is given but is irrelevant if event2 never actually occurs.)

Because event1 happened initially and it blocks any subsequent events, event2 does not occur in the actual execution described.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" In standard logic this is a material implication. Since in the actual execution event2 does not happen, the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" We have C1 = true and event1 did happen initially, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as: in the given execution/timeline (or across the possible runs allowed by the premises) C2 is true at all relevant times/points. Because nothing ever happens after event1 and C2 is true initially, C2 remains true, so C3 is true. (If you instead read ""always"" as ranging over some broader set of hypothetical alternate executions where event1 might not happen, you would need extra assumptions; with the given premises there is no such alternate where event2 occurs instead.)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what about C5?
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Again this is an implication whose antecedent (event2 happens) is false in the actual execution. A material implication with a false antecedent is true regardless of the consequent, so C5 is true (vacuously true).

Conclusion: Under the given premises (event1 happens initially and blocks all further events), event2 never occurs, making both C1 and C5 true by vacuous implication. If you intended a different semantics for ""always"" or intended to consider alternate runs where event2 could occur instead of event1, say so and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.

False.

Reason: take a run with three states t0, t1, t2 where
- t0: initially event2 happened;
- t1: event1 happens (required after event2);
- t2: no events (because after event1 no other events can happen).

Now evaluate:

- C4 at t1 asserts ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e. at t2). But at t2 event1 does not happen (no events after event1), so C3 is false at t2; therefore C4 is false at t1.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Additional constraints from the context:
  - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, all later states have no events).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. if event2 ever occurs, a later event1 must occur).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Once event1 occurs, no further events occur at any later time (so event2 cannot occur after an occurrence of event1).
- If event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur. Because event1 already happens initially, any trace with event2 before the initial event1 is impossible here; with the given initial event1, event2 cannot occur afterwards (by the first rule). So in the actual trace implied by the context, event2 never occurs.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e. in the immediate successor state).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is an implication of the form (P → P), which is always true in any state where P is defined.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (C3 holds at every state).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (there exists some future state where C4 holds).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C5?
- Given the context, after the initial state (where event1 occurred) no events ever occur again, so in the next state event1 does not happen. Hence C1 is false in the next state, and likewise C2 is false.
- C3 (C1 → C2) is true everywhere because the implication with identical antecedent and consequent is true (in particular it is vacuously true whenever C1 is false).
- Therefore C3 holds in every state, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.
- If C4 is true now (and thus true at every state), then ""C4 eventually holds"" is also true (it already holds now). Hence C5 is True.

(Assumption made: we use the usual state-sequence interpretation where ""next state"" exists and later states simply have no events; the conclusion is the same under the natural interpretations consistent with the given constraints.)

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event2 happens.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1 happens, no other events (neither event1 nor event2) can happen in any later state. So the timeline of events forced by the rules is:
  - s0: event2 (given)
  - s1: event1 (must follow event2)
  - s2, s3, ...: no events

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
Interpretation uses usual linear-time operators (Next, Always, Eventually).
- C1: (event1) OR (event2) — holds in a state iff at least one of the events occurs in that state.
- C2: Next C1 — C1 holds in the next state.
- C3: Always C2 — in every state from now on, C2 holds (i.e., in every state the next state satisfies C1).
- C4: Next C3 — C3 holds in the next state.
- C5: Eventually C4 — there exists some future state where C4 holds.

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluation on the timeline?
Evaluate per state given the forced timeline:

- s0: event2 = true, event1 = false → C1(s0)=true.
  Next state s1 has C1(s1)=true, so C2(s0)=true.
- s1: event1 = true, event2 = false → C1(s1)=true.
  Next state s2 has no events → C1(s2)=false, so C2(s1)=false.
- s2 and onward: no events → C1 = false, so C2 = false at s2 and later.

C3 = Always C2 requires C2 to be true at every state. But C2 is true only at s0 and false at s1 and thereafter, so C3 is false in every state. Therefore C4 = Next C3 is false in every state (since C3 is never true at any successor). Hence C4 never holds, so C5 = Eventually C4 is false.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (given).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen → event1 implies event2 (event1 -> event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen → event2 implies event1 (event2 -> event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (This is the rule event2 -> event1.)
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Same as C1.)
- C3: C2 always holds. (Claims the rule in C2 is universally true.)
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. (A meta-implication: C1 -> C3.)
- C5: Event2 happens and C4 holds. (Conjunction of the fact event2 and the statement C4.)

4) How they relate and truth-values
- From the context we have event2 -> event1, so C1 is true. C2 is the same statement, so C2 is also true.
- The context gives the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" as a general rule, so C2 “always holds” — hence C3 is true.
- C4 is the implication (C1 -> C3). Since C1 is true and C3 is true, the implication C1 -> C3 is true, so C4 holds.
- Finally C5 = (event2 happens) AND (C4 holds). Event2 is given as happening, and we just established C4 holds, so C5 is true.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e. the system is terminal after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (i.e. the system is terminal after event2).
Because event1 happened initially, we are already in a state after event1; therefore no further events can occur from that state.

3) Meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: (event2 happens) and (C1 holds).
- C3: eventually C2 holds (there is some future state where C2 is true).
- C4: C3 does not hold (i.e. C2 never occurs).
- C5: C4 always holds (C3 is false in every state, i.e. ""C2 never occurs"" is true now and forever).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Since we start in the state after event1 and no events can happen after event1, there are no future events:
  - event1 does not necessarily recur in the next state, so C1 is false (no new event occurs).
  - event2 cannot occur, so C2 is false.
  - therefore C3 (""eventually C2"") is false.
  - C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.
  - C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true, because C3 can never become true in any future state.

Remark on ambiguity: If one read ""no other events"" to mean ""no events different from the one that just happened"" (i.e. event1 could repeat but event2 could not), then C1 would be true (event1 can occur next) but event2 still cannot occur, so C2 and C3 remain false, C4 true, and C5 still true. In all reasonable readings consistent with the given rules, C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: we start in a state ""after event1"" and by the rules no further events can occur. So C2 can never become true, hence C3 (""eventually C2"") is false, C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true now and in every future state (there are no states where C3 could become true), so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true."

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (we read this as: in the next state after a state where event1 holds, event2 holds).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so a state after event2 has neither event1 nor event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (At S0 this says event2 holds in S1.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" (This is just the disjunction of event2-now or event2-in-next-state.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (C2 must be true in every state along the run.)
- C4: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Same form as C1; evaluated at the state of interest, e.g. S0.)
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds.""

4) How they relate and evaluation on the run
- From the rules and S0 we get this run fragment: S0: event1; S1: event2 (forced by the rule); S2: no events (because after event2 no events can happen).
- Evaluate at S0:
  - C1 is true at S0 because event2 indeed occurs in S1.
  - C4 is the same and is true at S0.
  - C2 is true at S0 (since C1 is true).
  - C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false: check S2 — at S2 neither event2 holds now nor in the next state (S3), so C1 is false at S2 and event2 is false at S2, so C2 is false at S2. Thus C2 does not hold in every state, so C3 is false.
- Therefore C5 = C3 and C4 is false (true ∧ false = false).

Conclusion: C5 is False. (If you meant a different temporal reading of ""must happen"" — e.g. eventually rather than next-state — state-by-state evaluation changes C1/C4, but under the natural next-state reading above the answer stays False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: At S0 C4 holds but C3 (""C2 always"") fails (at S2 neither event2 now nor next), so C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is false."

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (the system starts in the “after event2” situation).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Since we start after event2, no further events can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the formula event2 → event2, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Because C1 is true right now (it is a tautology), it certainly holds at some time in the future (indeed now). So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This negates C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, hence true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is the implication C3 → C4.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and conclusion)?
- C1 and C4 are tautologically true.
- C2 is true because C1 holds now/always.
- C3 is false (it asserts the negation of a true statement).
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Since C3 is false, C3 → C4 is true regardless of C4.
- Therefore C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (it’s true initially).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.)

Because event1 already happened initially and rule B forbids any further events after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time in any execution.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (taken as the claim that event2 does occur in the system; for our purposes this is false because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of C1)
- C3: ""Event2 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" (i.e., (not C1) or C1)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (C4 is true in all states/times)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition + rule B: event2 cannot occur → C1 is false → C2 is true → C3 is false.
- But logically C4 = (not C1) or C1 is a classical tautology (law of excluded middle), so C4 is true regardless of the truth of C1.
- Therefore C4 holds in all states, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.

Summary of truth values:
- C1: False
- C2: True
- C3: False
- C4: True (tautologically)
- C5: True

Thus C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C4 is (not C1) or C1, a tautology, so it holds in all states; therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 occurs, no other events can occur (so once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterwards).
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (if event1 ever happens, the system requires event2 to follow).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the implication rule about the relation between event1 and event2. Given the stated transition rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" C1 is true as a rule of the system. It is also vacuously true in any run where event1 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting ""eventually holds"" in the usual temporal sense (there exists some time at or after now when C1 is true), this is asking whether C1 will be true at some time in the execution. If C1 is already true from the start (either because the rule enforces it or because it is vacuously true), then ""eventually C1"" is satisfied.
- C3: same as C2 (it is the same statement repeated).
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" This is the disjunction of the two identical statements; logically it is equivalent to C2 (or to ""C1 eventually holds"").

Step 4 — how they relate and the truth of C4
- Because the system states that ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" C1 is true as a property of the system.
- Given C1 is true already, ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2 and C3) is also true (it holds now, so it holds at some time).
- Since both C2 and C3 are true, their disjunction C4 is true.

Conclusion: C4 is True.

(Nota bene: if one used a different technical reading of ""eventually"" that excluded the present moment or required a change from false to true, the conclusion could be reframed; under the standard interpretation where ""eventually"" means ""at some time now or in the future,"" C4 is True.)

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the system reaches a state in which no further events occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 will never occur given the first rule).

A convenient timeline: time 0: event1 occurs. For all times t > 0: no events occur.

3) What each sub-condition means (standard LTL-style reading):
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" = G(event2) (event2 holds at every time).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" = (event1 at the current state) ∧ G(event2).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = F(C3).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X(C4).

4) How they relate and truth values under the given scenario:
- Event2 never occurs (because after event1 no other events can happen). So C1 (G(event2)) is false.
- C2 requires both event1 (true at time 0) and C1 (false), so C2 is false at time 0.
- Therefore C3 = ¬C2 is true at time 0.
- C4 = F(C3) is true at time 0 because C3 already holds (eventually C3 is satisfied immediately).
- C5 = X(C4): we must check C4 in the next state (time 1). In the next state no events occur, but C2 is still false there (event1 does not hold at time 1 and G(event2) is false), so C3 is true at time 1, hence F(C3) (i.e. C4) is true at time 1. Therefore X(C4) is true at time 0.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

(If you intended different semantics for ""event1 happens"" or for the scope of the atomic propositions, let me know—the answer above assumes the usual state-based temporal interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Brief justification: At time 0, event1 holds but event2 never occurs, so C1 is false and C2 is false, hence C3 is true at time 0. Thus C4 = F(C3) is true at time 0. In the next state (time 1) C2 is still false, so C3 holds there too and therefore C4 holds at time 1. So X(C4) is true at time 0."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Additional rules: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen.
- From those rules and the initial fact, event2 does not occur at any time (it cannot occur after the initial event1).

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either happens, no further events can happen.
- In particular, because event1 has happened first, event2 cannot happen afterward.

3) Meaning of each condition
- C1: (event1 → event2).
- C2: (event1 → event2). (same as C1)
- C3: (event1 → event2). (same as C1)
- C4: (C2 → C3).
- C5: (C1 ∨ C4).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Since event1 did happen and event2 did not, the conditional (event1 → event2) is false (true antecedent, false consequent). Thus C1, C2, C3 are all false.
- C4 is the implication (C2 → C3). An implication with a false antecedent is true in standard propositional logic, so C4 is true.
- C5 is (C1 ∨ C4). With C1 false and C4 true, C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

(If you intended a different logical reading of ""if ... then ..."" — e.g., a strict causal law requiring temporal possibility or simultaneous occurrence — mention that and I can re-evaluate under that alternative semantics. Under ordinary propositional logic, the evaluation above applies.)

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the initial state) event2 has happened.

A natural intended timeline from the description:
- t0: event2 occurs.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → t1: event1 occurs.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → t2 and later: no events ever occur.

2) Transition rules between events
- Once event2 has occurred, the system must (next) have event1.
- After event1 occurs, the system reaches a terminal situation with no further events.

(So event2 occurs only at t0, event1 at t1, and nothing afterwards.)

3) What each sub-condition means (temporal reading)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (F event2). True at any state where event2 occurs now or will occur later.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1). At time t this means: at t+1, event2 eventually happens (from that point forward).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" (C2 → event2) evaluated at the same state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (G C3): in every state the implication C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (F C4): there is some state from which C3 holds in all future states (equivalently, eventually G C3).

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation on the timeline
Evaluate at each state:

- t0:
  - event2 is true, so C1 (F event2) is true (it holds now).
  - C2 = X C1: at t1, is there any future event2? No — event2 only happened at t0 and will not reoccur, so at t1 F event2 is false. Thus C2 is false at t0.
  - C3 = (C2 → event2): false → anything is true, so C3 is true at t0.

- t1:
  - event1 is true, event2 is false and will not occur later, so C1 at t1 is false.
  - C2 at t1 = X C1: at t2 there is still no future event2, so C2 false.
  - C3 at t1: again false → anything is true, so C3 true.

- t2 and later:
  - Same pattern: C1 false, C2 false, C3 true.

Thus C3 holds in every state, so C4 = G C3 is true (it always holds). Because C4 already holds at the initial state, ""eventually C4"" (C5) is also true (it holds right away).

Therefore C5 is True.

Short answers up front: C5 is True. Below is the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 happened (so event2 is true at the initial state; event1 is false there).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: if event1 holds at time t, then event2 holds at time t+1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: if event2 holds at time t, then event1 holds at time t+1.
- Together these force alternation: a state with event2 is followed by a state with event1, and vice versa.

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — logically equivalent to just ""event1 happens"" (C1 ↔ event1 at the current state).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — since C1 ↔ event1, C2 ↔ event1 as well.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — C3 ↔ ¬C2 ↔ ¬event1 (at the current state).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C4 ↔ next-state(C3) ↔ next-state(¬event1) (i.e., in the next state event1 is false).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — C5 ↔ ¬C4 ↔ ¬(next-state(¬event1)) which is equivalent to next-state(event1) (classically).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and evaluation given the rules and initial state)?
- At time 0: event2 is true, so event1 is false. Therefore C1 and C2 are false at time 0; C3 is true at time 0.
- By the transition rules, because event2 holds at time 0, event1 must hold at time 1. So in the next state event1 is true.
- C4 requires that in the next state event1 is false; but we just saw event1 is true at time 1, so C4 is false.
- Therefore C5 = ¬C4 is true. Equivalently, C5 says event1 holds in the next state, which does hold given the rules and the initial event2.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

True

Reasoning (brief):
- Let t0 be the initial state. At t0 event2 is true, so C1 (event2 does not happen) is false and C2 (not C1) is true.
- C3 is ""if C2 then event1"". At t0 C2 is true but event1 is not true until the next state, so C3 may be false at t0. However at t1 event1 holds and C2 is false (event2 is not happening at t1), so the implication C3 is true at t1 (vacuously or because event1 holds).
- Therefore C3 holds at some future state (t1), so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true at t0.
- At t1, the same reasoning shows C4 is true there as well (C3 holds at or after t1), so C4 holds in the next state from t0.
Thus C5 is True."

Answering step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur next (or at least eventually after it).
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur next (or at least eventually after it).
- Thus starting from the initial event2, the system forces a sequence that alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... — so event2 occurs at the initial time and then repeatedly thereafter (every other step).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
Interpreting the statements literally:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — logically this is just the same conjunct twice; it is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" It is true at any time where event2 happens. (If one intended it to mean two distinct occurrences, the system still produces multiple occurrences because of the alternation; see below.)
- C2: identical to C1, so the same truth conditions.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — equivalent to C2 ∧ event2, which reduces to event2 (or to having multiple occurrences of event2 if that was the intended reading).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" — since both reduce to event2, C4 is true exactly when event2 holds.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — asks whether at some time in the future (possibly now) C4 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C5?
- Because event2 has already happened initially, C1 and C2 are immediately satisfied under the usual (non-multoccurrence) reading, and so are C3 and C4.
- Even under the reading that requires multiple occurrences, the enforced alternation (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...) guarantees additional occurrences of event2, so C1–C4 still become true.
- Therefore C4 holds now (and will hold repeatedly), so “eventually C4” is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurs initially and by the rules event2 and event1 alternate forever, so C1–C4 (which amount to occurrences of event2) hold now and repeatedly — hence C4 holds at some time, so ""eventually C4"" (C5) is true."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so event1 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen ⇒ once event1 occurs, event2 cannot occur later (so effectively event2 will not occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen ⇒ event2 ⇒ event1, but since event2 does not occur, this implication is vacuously satisfied.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value given the context)?
- C1: ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" ≡ event1. Since event1 happened initially, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This is a temporal statement and is slightly ambiguous: if ""always"" means ""at every future time point C1 is true"" then its truth depends on whether you treat the occurrence of event1 as persistent. However, this ambiguity is irrelevant for the final result (see below).
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" = C2 ∨ C3. Since C3 is True, C4 is True regardless of C2.
- C5: ""event1 happens or C4 holds"" = event1 ∨ C4. event1 is True and C4 is True, so C5 is True.

4) How these conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because event1 is true, C1 and C3 are true. That already makes C4 true (via C3), and therefore C5 is true (either because event1 is true or because C4 is true). So C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True (under the usual temporal reading where “eventually” may be satisfied now).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- “After event2, event1 must happen”: whenever event2 occurs, that forces event1 to hold at (or after) that point.
- “After event1, no other events can happen”: once event1 holds the execution is terminal (no further events/transitions).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” (True if event1 holds now or at some future point.)
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: “C1 or C2” — since C1 and C2 are the same, C3 is equivalent to C1.
- C4: “C3 always holds” — C3 must hold at the current state and at every future state.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds” — there exists a time (possibly now) at which C4 holds.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 holds in the initial state, C1 (and C2) is true at the initial state.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so no future state can falsify “event1 eventually happens” (in standard temporal logic F p is true if p holds now). Thus C3 holds now and at every reachable state, so C4 holds.
- Since C4 already holds now, “C4 eventually holds” is satisfied immediately, so C5 holds.

Conclusion: C5 is True under the usual semantics where “eventually” can be satisfied at the current state. (If you adopt a nonstandard reading that “eventually” strictly means some later state and not now, you should state that explicitly — with that alternate reading one would need additional assumptions about a future occurrence of event1.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 holds in the initial state, so C1 (and C2) are true now, hence C3 and C4 hold at all reachable states (no transitions after event1), and therefore C4 holds immediately so C5 (""eventually C4"") is true."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so there is a next state, call it state1, where event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — no events in any states after state1).

So the only possible timeline consistent with the rules is:
- state0: event2 happens.
- state1: event1 happens.
- no further states with events after state1.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" (redundant) — simply: event2 happens in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — from the current state forward, in every state C1 is true (i.e., event2 holds in every state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — it is not the case that event2 holds in every state (existence of some future state where event2 does not hold).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" — in the current state both C3 is true and event1 occurs.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" — in the next state, C4 is true.

4) How the conditions evaluate on the timeline
- state0:
  - event2: true → C1 true.
  - Is C1 always true (C2)? No, because in state1 event2 does not happen, so C2 is false.
  - Therefore C3 (¬C2) is true at state0.
  - event1 is false at state0, so C4 is false at state0.
  - C5 at state0 asks: is C4 true in state1? (evaluate below)
- state1:
  - event1: true.
  - event2: false, so C1 is false in state1, hence C2 is false there and C3 is true.
  - Therefore C4 (C3 and event1) is true in state1.

Since C4 is true in the next state (state1), C5 is true in the initial state.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: In state0 C3 holds (C1 is not always true) and event1 occurs in state1; in state1 both C3 and event1 are true, so C4 holds in the next state and thus C5 is true."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is a given fact).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the sequence ends after event1).
- From these we know in every situation described by the context: event2 happened and then event1 happened.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally event1 → event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Formally (C1) ∨ (event1).
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Formally C2 ∨ C3.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the context we have event2 = True (it happened). An implication event1 → event2 is true whenever the consequent (event2) is true, so C1 is True.
- Given C1 is True, C2 = C1 ∨ event1 is True (disjunction true if one disjunct is true). Same for C3.
- Then C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is True (either or both disjuncts are true).

Therefore C4 is True.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the initial state) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen after it (event2 is terminal).

Given the initial condition that event2 already happened, no further events can occur (in particular, event1 will never occur after the initial state).

3) What each Ci means (interpreting ""happens"" as “happens now/at the relevant state” and ""always"" as globally):
- C1: (event1) OR (event2). At the initial state this is true because event2 happened.
- C2: (event1) AND C1. This requires event1 to hold (and C1), so C2 is equivalent to event1. Since event1 does not hold at the initial state (and, in fact, will never hold later because the system is stuck after event2), C2 is false.
- C3: C2 always holds (i.e., C2 at every state). Because C2 is false at the initial state (and never becomes true), C3 is false.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state. Since C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: C4 does not hold (i.e., not C4). Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- C2 is false → C3 false → C4 false → C5 true.

Note/caveat: If one used a different semantics for “next” on a terminal state (e.g., treating next as undefined or vacuously true), the middle step could be interpreted differently; with the usual linear-time semantics where ""next"" is false at a terminal state or there is an explicit next state with no events, the chain above holds and C5 is True.

Reasoning (brief):
- S0: initially event1 happened.
- By the rules, S1 must have event2, and after event2 no other events occur.
- C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false at S0 because S1 has event2, not event1.
- C2 (¬C1) is therefore true.
- C3 (""if event1 then C2"") holds: at S0 event1 and C2 are true, and at S1 the antecedent is false, so the implication is true.
- C4 (""eventually C3"") is true because C3 already holds now (and everywhere).
- C5 (""always C4"") is true because C4 holds in every reachable state.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (it is true at the initial point).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so any execution containing event2 will subsequently contain event1).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Combining A and B with the initial condition gives the only possible timeline: event2 occurs (initially), then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (Given the initial condition, this is true.)
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (Exactly the same as C1, so also true.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (Claims that C2 is false.)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (Claims that C3 is false.)
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" (Both parts must be true.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- C1 is true (event2 already occurred).
- C2 is true (same statement as C1).
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.
- Therefore C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.
- C5 = C1 AND C4 = true AND true = true.

Conclusion
C5 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (initially).
- Additional facts: after event2, no other events can happen; likewise after event1, no other events can happen. So each event, if it occurs, is terminal (prevents any further events).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either happens, no further events occur.
- Because event2 already happened initially, no other events can happen thereafter (in particular event1 cannot occur after that).

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — redundant conjunction; effectively ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — requires event1 and event2 to both have happened.
- C3: same as C2 (it is repeated): requires event1 and event2 both happened.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" — the implication C2 ⇒ C3.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- Given the initial condition (event2 happened initially and is terminal), event1 cannot happen afterwards, so C1 is false. Consequently C2 and C3 are false (they require event1 and event2 both).
- Logically, C2 and C3 are the same statement. Therefore C2 ⇒ C3 is true (either because they are identical or vacuously true when C2 is false).

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Timeline (from the text): initially (state s0) event1 happened.
- Rule “after event1, event2 must happen” means at the next state after any state where event1 happens, event2 happens. So from s0 we get event2 at s1.
- Rule “after event2, no other events can happen” means once event2 occurs, all later states have no events. So after s1 there are no events at s2, s3, …

So the concrete timeline is:
- s0: event1
- s1: event2
- s2, s3, … : no events

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Deterministic sequence implied by the two rules: event1 → (next) event2 → (then) nothing forever.
- No other transitions that produce events after event2.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpret as evaluated at the current state s0 unless a “next” is explicit)
- C1: “event1 happens or event2 happens.” That is true in a state exactly when that state has either event1 or event2.
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” At a state x, C2 says: in the next state (x+1) either event1 or event2 holds.
- C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” At a state x, C3 is the implication (C2 → event1) evaluated at x (i.e., if the next state has event1 or event2, then event1 holds in the current state x).
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” At state x, C4 says: at x+1 the implication (C2 → event1) is true.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” At the current state x, C5 asserts that C4 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is their truth value given the timeline?
Evaluate at s0 (the initial state):

- C1 at s0: s0 has event1, so C1 is True.
- C2 at s0: C2 says C1 holds at s1. At s1 event2 holds, so C1 (event1 or event2) is True at s1. Therefore C2 is True (from s0’s viewpoint).
- C3 at s0: C3 is (C2 → event1) at s0. We have C2 True and event1 does hold at s0, so the implication is True. Thus C3 is True at s0.
- C4 at s0: C4 says C3 holds at s1. Evaluate C3 at s1: there C3 is the implication (C2@ s1 → event1@ s1). At s1, C2@ s1 means “C1 holds at s2.” At s2 there are no events, so C1 is False at s2, hence C2@ s1 is False. An implication with a false antecedent is True, so C3 is True at s1. Therefore C4 is True (C3 holds in the next state).
- C5 at s0: C5 asserts “C4 does not hold.” But we just found C4 holds, so C5 is False.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

False

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
So occurrence of either event is terminal (prevents any further events).

Step 3 — meaning of each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (event2 never occurs)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., event2 does happen)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future time C2 becomes true — equivalently, event2 will occur at some time)
- C4: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" (i.e., either event2 eventually happens, or event2 never happens)

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- Because event1 has already happened and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot occur at any time. Thus:
  - C1 is true.
  - C2 (the negation of C1) is false.
  - C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false — C2 cannot become true because no further events can occur.
  - C4 is true (same as C1).
- C5 = C3 or C4. Since C4 is true, C5 is true regardless of C3.

Answer: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event1 has already happened and prevents any further events, so event2 cannot occur. Hence C4 (""event2 does not happen"") is true, making C5 = C3 or C4 true."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens then event2 must happen (event1 → event2).
- After event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally event2 → event2. This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 is true regardless of whether event2 actually occurs.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally event2 → C1. Since C1 is true, the implication event2 → C1 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3: same as C2, so it is also true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" (C2 ∨ C3).

4) How they relate and conclusion
- C1 is true (tautology).
- Therefore C2 and C3 are true.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is true.

So C4 is True. The temporal rules (initial event2 and terminality) do not change this logical conclusion because C1 is a tautology.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so event2 follows event1).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so event1 follows event2).
- Together these rules force an alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... indefinitely (assuming “must happen” means the next relevant occurrence is forced).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This restates the rule “after event2, event1 must happen.” True as a rule.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since event2 happens initially and C1 is true, C2 is true at the initial moment.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This would mean for every time point from some reference, C2 is true (i.e., at every time event2 happens and C1 holds). C1 holds as a rule, but event2 does not hold at times when event1 occurs, so C2 is not true at those times. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This says there is some future time from which C2 holds at every subsequent time. Because the system alternates indefinitely, there is no future point from which event2 holds at every subsequent time, so C3 never becomes true; thus C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

4) How the conditions relate:
- C1 is true (rule). C2 is true initially (conjunction of the initial event2 and C1). But because of the enforced alternation, C2 cannot hold at every time, so C3 is false. C3 never becomes true at any future time, so C4 is false. Hence C5 (the negation of C4) is true.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it has already occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: nothing happens after it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — logically equivalent to: Event1 happens. (redundant disjunction)
- C2: same as C1 — Event1 happens.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" — means Event2 happens AND Event1 happens.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" — means Event1 holds AND (Event2 AND Event1) — equivalent to Event1 AND Event2 (order not shown by the conjunction).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — means NOT (Event1 AND Event2).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the initial condition and rules: event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen, so event1 does happen. Therefore both event2 and event1 occur (event2 first, then event1).  
- So C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = True (event2 and event1), C4 = True (both hold), and C5 = NOT C4 = False.

  - C2 (C1 or event2) is true.
  - C3 (C2 eventually holds) is true.
  - C4 (event1 or C3) is true.
- C5 asserts C4 holds in the next state s1.
- But after event2 no other events can happen, so in s1 event2 does not occur. From s1 onward event2 never occurs, hence:

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.
- Additional context: after event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs nothing else can occur). Also: if event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Because event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after it, no occurrence of event2 can happen at any time in this execution. (Event2 is impossible in this scenario.)
- Separately, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" says any time event2 occurs, event1 must occur after it. That rule is moot here because event2 never occurs, but it does not contradict anything.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally: event2 → event2. This is a tautology (always true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" In temporal terms: eventually C1 is true. Since C1 is true already (a tautology), ""eventually C1"" is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is true now, eventually C2 is also true.
- C4: Same as C1 (event2 → event2), so also true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Formally C3 → C4.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C5?
- C1 and C4 are tautologies, therefore true in the given model.
- C2 is true because C1 holds (so “eventually C1” is satisfied).
- C3 is true because C2 holds (so “eventually C2” is satisfied).
- Therefore the antecedent of C5 (C3) is true and the consequent (C4) is true; so the implication C3 → C4 is true.
- Even by vacuous-implication reasoning, implications of the form p→p or true→true are true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened (so the system starts in a state after event2).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (states reached by event1 are terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (states reached by event2 are terminal).
Because the initial state is “after event2,” that initial state has no successor states (it is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (Reads as: in the current state, event1 does not occur.)
- C2: “Event1 does not happen.” (Same as C1.)
- C3: “C2 always holds.” (Reads as: in every reachable state, C2 is true.)
- C4: “If C1 holds, then C3 holds.” (A conditional: C1 ⇒ C3.)
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” (Reads as: in the immediate successor state, C4 is true.)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and evaluation
- In the initial state, event2 occurred and event1 did not, so C1 and C2 are true in the initial state.
- There are no successor states (the initial state is terminal), so the only reachable state is the initial one. Since C2 is true in that only state, C3 (“C2 always holds”) is true.
- Given C1 is true and C3 is true, the implication C4 (C1 ⇒ C3) is true in the initial state.
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state. But there is no next state (no successor), so whether C5 is true depends on the chosen formal semantics for “next”:
  - Under the usual linear-time/temporal-next semantics (e.g., LTL), X φ (“φ holds in the next state”) is false at a terminal state because there is no next state to satisfy φ. Under this common reading, C5 is False.
  - Under some branching semantics for universal next (e.g., an interpretation of “for all next states, C4 holds”), a universal claim over an empty set of successors can be treated as vacuously true; under that reading C5 could be considered True. But that is a different formalization (and uncommon if the phrase “holds in the next state” is meant as the LTL-style next).

Conclusion
- With the standard linear-time “next” interpretation, C5 is False (because there is no next state to satisfy C4). If a vacuous-universal semantics for “next” is intended, one could instead declare C5 True — but the usual reading yields False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state is terminal (no successor), and under the standard linear-time ""next"" (X) semantics Xφ is false when there is no next state, so C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false."

Summary answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in every state following a state where event2 happened, neither event1 nor event2 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs in some state, then event2 must occur afterward).

Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 no events can occur, event1 cannot occur in any later state (there is no opportunity for any event after that initial event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 or event2"" — equivalent to just event2.
- C2: ""event1 or C1"" — equivalent to event1 ∨ event2.
- C3: ""event1 or C2"" — equivalent to event1 ∨ (event1 ∨ event2) which simplifies to event1 ∨ event2 (so C3 = C2).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C3 evaluated at the state immediately after the current one.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — i.e. ¬(C3 holds in the next state).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C5?
- In the state after the initial state (the ""next"" state), no events occur (because event2 happened initially and after event2 no events can happen). Therefore at that next state event1 = false and event2 = false, so C3 (event1 ∨ event2) is false in the next state.
- Hence C4 (C3 holds in the next state) is false, so C5 = ¬C4 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C3 simplifies to (event1 ∨ event2). Since event2 occurred initially and no events can occur afterwards, in the next state both event1 and event2 are false, so C3 is false there. Thus C4 (C3 holds in the next state) is false and C5 = ¬C4 is true."

Short answer: C4 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After an occurrence of event1, event2 must occur.
- After an occurrence of event2, event1 must occur.
So once event2 has happened, the rules force an alternating sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … (each occurrence forces the next).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” (This is ambiguous: it can mean (A) event2 holds at every moment, or (B) event2 keeps occurring repeatedly / occurs infinitely often. See note below.)
- C2: “Event1 happens or C1 holds.” (a disjunction; true if event1 happens, or if C1 is true.)
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold (conjunction).

4) How do they relate and final truth value?
- From the rules and the initial event2, event1 must happen next; so “Event1 happens” is true (it will occur, at least once and in fact infinitely often in the forced alternation).
- Therefore C2 is true (because the left disjunct “Event1 happens” is true). C3 is identical, so C3 is true.
- Hence C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is true.

Note on C1’s ambiguity:
- If C1 is read strictly as “event2 holds at every single moment” (A) — that is false, because event2 does not occur at the same moments as event1 (they alternate).
- If C1 is read as “event2 will occur repeatedly / infinitely often” (B) — that is true, because the alternation guarantees infinitely many event2 occurrences.
- The truth of C4 does not depend on which reading of C1 you take, because C2 and C3 are already satisfied by the fact that event1 does happen.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the initial state s0) event1 happened (so event1 is true at s0, event2 is false at s0).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 holds at some state, the next state must have event1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 happens, there are no further events in later states (i.e. the run terminates or no successor state with any event).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2 at the current state).
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens now → (X event2) OR event2.
- C4: C3 always holds → globally (C3) at every state.
- C5: C1 holds or C4 holds → (X event2) OR (always C3).

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- At the initial state s0: event1 is true, event2 is false.
- Because event1 occurs at s0 and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", there is no next state with any event. Under the standard semantics of the next operator X, X event2 is false at a state with no successor. Thus C1 and C2 are false at s0.
- event2 is false at s0, so C3 = C2 OR event2 = false OR false = false at s0.
- Therefore C4 (""always C3"") is false (it fails already at s0).
- Finally C5 = C1 OR C4 = false OR false = false.

So, given the stated initial condition and transition rules (and the usual interpretation that Xφ is false at a terminal state), C5 is False.

(If you intended a different semantics for ""next"" or for terminal states, tell me which and I will re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: at the initial state event1 holds and there is no successor, so X event2 is false and event2 is false, hence C3 is false, C4 (always C3) is false, and C5 = C1 ∨ C4 = false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens, no other events can happen afterwards.
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards.
Because event2 already happened initially, no further events can occur at any later time.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" — both events occur (at some points in the run).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — C1 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some point in time (including the initial instant) C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — C3 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — C4 is true in the immediate successor state.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot ever occur. Therefore C1 is false.
- Hence C2 (C1 does not hold) is true (already true in the initial state).
- Since C2 is already true now, ""eventually C2"" (C3) is true.
- Therefore C4 (C3 does not hold) is false.
- C5 asserts C4 holds in the next state; since C4 is false now (and remains false), C5 is false.

Possible semantic variants (next-state existence, whether ""eventually"" includes the present) do not change the conclusion under the given facts: C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).
- Additional rules: after event1 occurs, event2 must happen sometime later; after event2 happens, no further events occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- event1 → eventually event2 (event2 will occur after event1).
- event2 is terminal: once event2 has occurred nothing else happens afterward.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (interpreted as “event2 does not occur”).
- C2: “C1 always holds.” (C1 holds at every time).
- C3: “C2 holds or event1 happens.” (C2 ∨ event1).
- C4: “C3 always holds.” (C3 holds at every time).
- C5: “C4 always holds.” (C4 holds at every time — equivalent to C4 in standard temporal logic).

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluate under the scenario?
- Because event1 occurs initially and that guarantees event2 will occur later, event2 does in fact occur. Therefore the statement “event2 does not happen” (C1) is false as a global claim.
- C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false, because C1 is not true at all times.
- C3 = (C2 ∨ event1). At the initial time C3 is true only because event1 has happened. But after the required event2 occurs, event1 is no longer happening and C2 is false, so C3 becomes false at those later times.
- Since C3 does not hold at all times, C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false.
- C5 is “C4 always holds”. Because C4 is already false, C5 is also false (and ordinary temporal logic gives G G φ = G φ, so nesting “always” doesn’t rescue it).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial time).
- Rule: once event1 has happened, no other events can happen after it.

Step 2 — transition rules (constraints)
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.
- If event1 happens, nothing else can happen after that.
Given that event1 already happened initially, no other events can occur after that moment — so event2 cannot occur at any later time. Under the usual reading of ""initially, event1 happened"" (i.e. event1 is already true at the start), there is no time before that for event2 to have happened, so event2 does not happen.

Step 3 — meaning and truth value of each Ci
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False, because event1 did happen initially.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" — False, because event2 does not happen and C1 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" — same as C1, so False.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" — True. This implication is vacuously true because C2 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" — False, because event2 does not happen (conjunction with true C4 is still false).

Step 4 — how they relate
- C2 depends on either event2 or C1; since neither is true, C2 is false.
- C4 is true only as a material implication with a false antecedent (C2), so it does not rescue C1/C3.
- C5 requires event2 to be true; since event2 does not occur, C5 is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 has happened.
- Extra constraint: after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never occurs at any time after the initial state (in particular it never occurs at or after the initial state).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can occur. That means once we are in the initial state where event2 happened, no future state will have event1 (or any other new event).
- The other rule “after event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs; it places no additional obligations in the execution that actually happens.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens or event1 happens.” This is equivalent to just “event1 happens” (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” = next(C1).
- C3: “C2 does not hold” = not next(C1).
- C4: “C3 does not hold” = not(not next(C1)) = next(C1).
- C5: “C4 eventually holds” = eventually(next(C1)).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values under the given scenario?
- Because event1 never occurs in any state, C1 is false in every state.
- Therefore next(C1) (C2) is false in every state.
- Hence C3 = not next(C1) is true.
- C4 = not C3 = false.
- C5 = eventually(C4) = eventually(false) is false (there is no future state where C4 is true because C4 is false at every state).

Answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must (i.e. will) happen at some later time.
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must (i.e. will) happen at some later time.
Thus, starting from the initial event2, the system ensures both events occur (and in fact they alternate).

3) Meaning of each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (a conjunction about those events)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" (i.e. both C1 and C2 are true)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (negation of C3)
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" (conjunction of event1 and C4)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the initial event2 and the transition rules, event1 does happen. So both event2 happens and event1 happens are true; therefore C1 is true. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is true.
- C3 = C1 and C2, so C3 is true (true and true).
- C4 = not C3, so C4 is false (since C3 is true).
- C5 = event1 happens (true) AND C4 holds (false) → overall false.

Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (call the initial state s0): event1 happened in s0.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: if event2 happens in some state, then event1 happens in the next state.
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreted as: once event1 has happened, no events occur in any later state. (So all states after the state where event1 occurred have no event1 and no event2.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (A global claim that event2 holds in every state.) Under the given scenario this is false because in s0 event1 happened and Rule B prevents events afterwards, so event2 does not happen everywhere.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" So C2 is true in a state iff (event2 always happens) or (event1 happens in that state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 is the negation of C2 at a state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" At a state X, C4 is true iff in the immediate next state (X+1) C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" At a state X, C5 is true iff in the immediate next state (X+1) C4 is true (equivalently, iff C3 holds in state X+2).

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation across states
Work with three consecutive states: s0 (initial), s1 (next), s2 (next after that).

- s0: event1 happened (given). By Rule B, no events occur in s1 or later.
- Evaluate C1, C2, C3 in each state:
  - C1 is a global property ""event2 always happens"" — false everywhere under these facts (event2 does not happen at s0, and no events occur later).
  - s0:
    - event1 holds, so C2 = (C1 or event1) = True.
    - Thus C3 = not C2 = False.
  - s1:
    - event1 does not hold (Rule B), and C1 is false, so C2 = False.
    - Thus C3 = True.
  - s2:
    - same as s1: no events, so C2 = False, C3 = True.

- Now C4 and C5 as defined:
  - C4 at s0 means ""C3 holds in s1"" — true because C3 is true in s1.
  - C4 at s1 means ""C3 holds in s2"" — true because C3 is true in s2.
  - C5 at s0 means ""C4 holds in s1"" — true because C4 is true in s1.

Therefore C5 is True (true in the initial state).

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (call that state 0) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After any state where event2 happened, the next state must have event1.
- After any state where event1 happened, the next state must have event2.
- Thus the system alternates: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — a formula evaluated at a given state; true at a state iff the immediately following state has event1.
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: C1 and C2 — logically equivalent to C1 (both identical), so C3 is true at a state exactly when the next state has event1.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 must be true at every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — at the current state, C5 is true iff at the following state C4 is true.

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the alternating pattern, at state0 (event2) the next state (state1) has event1, so C1/C3 are true at state0.
- At state1 (event1) the next state (state2) has event2, so C1/C3 are false at state1.
- Because C3 is false at state1, C4 (""always C3"") is false (it fails at least at state1).
- Therefore C4 is not true at any state that ""sees"" the failure, and in particular C4 is false at state1.
- C5 at state0 asks whether C4 holds in the next state (state1). Since C4 is false at state1, C5 is false at state0.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The system alternates event2 (state0) → event1 (state1) → event2 (state2) → ... So C3 (equivalent to ""next state has event1"") is true at state0 but false at state1, hence C4 (""always C3"") is false. C5 asks whether C4 holds in the next state (state1); since C4 is false at state1, C5 is False."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Now the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (e1) and event2 (e2).
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happened (e1 is true in the initial state).

(Assumption made for the rest: ""After X, Y must happen"" means whenever X is true in some state, Y is true in the next state. ""Eventually"" means “at some state at or after the current one” — the usual LTL F operator. The conclusion below is robust under the minor variant “strictly later” as well.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If e1 holds in a state, then e2 holds in the next state. (e1 → X e2)
- If e2 holds in a state, then e1 holds in the next state. (e2 → X e1)

From e1 true in the initial state these rules force an alternation:
- state 0: e1
- state 1: e2
- state 2: e1
- state 3: e2
- ... and so on.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens” = F e2 (there exists some state at/after the current one where e2 is true).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” = X (F e2) (in the next state, e2 will eventually happen).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” = X X (F e2) (two steps ahead, e2 will eventually happen).
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” = F (X X (F e2)) (at some state now or later, two steps ahead from that state, e2 will eventually happen).
- C5: “C4 does not hold” = ¬F (X X (F e2)).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
Evaluate each at the initial state (state 0) using the alternating trace above:
- C1: true, because e2 occurs at state 1.
- C2: true, because in state 1 (the next state) e2 occurs immediately, so F e2 holds there.
- C3: true, because in state 2 (two steps ahead) e2 will occur at state 3, so F e2 holds at state 2.
- C4: true, because C3 already holds at the initial state (so certainly C3 holds at some state), hence F (C3) is true.
- C5: “C4 does not hold” is therefore false, since C4 does hold.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: from the initial e1 you get the alternating trace e1,e2,e1,... so F e2 and hence X F e2 and XX F e2 hold; therefore F(XX F e2) is true, so its negation C5 is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → next event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 → next event1).
Thus the system alternates: starting with event2 at time 0, event1 at time 1, event2 at time 2, etc.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: event1 happens in the next state. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 or C2, so C3 is equivalent to “event1 happens in the next state.”
- C4: If event2 happens (now), then C3 holds (i.e. if event2 now, then event1 next).
- C5: C4 does not hold.

4) How do these relate and result?
- From the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” whenever event2 holds the next state has event1. That directly matches C4.
- Because C4 is true, the statement “C4 does not hold” (C5) is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.
- Additional conditions: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So once either event occurs the system has no further events (the run terminates or stays in a terminal state).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 occurs, there is no successor state with further events.
- If event2 occurs, there is no successor state with further events.
- Given the initial event1, event2 never occurs at any later point.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is true in the initial state because event1 happened.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to happen. Because event2 does not happen (event1 happened and no further events occur), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This asserts C2 in every state; since C2 is already false in the initial state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (terminal), so under the usual temporal semantics where X φ (""next φ"") is false when there is no successor, C4 is false. (Even if one instead treated terminal states as stuttering into identical successors, C3 is false everywhere, so C4 would still be false.)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false in the initial state, C5 is false.

4) How they relate
- C1 is true, but C2 requires event2 and therefore is false.
- Because C2 is false, all temporal statements that universally require C2 (C3), that require C3 in the next state (C4), or that assert C4 always (C5) are false.
- Thus the chain breaks at C2 and every subsequent Ci (C3, C4, C5) is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → event1 is terminal: once event1 holds, there are no successor states with any further events.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" → event2 would also be terminal if it ever occurred.
- Because event1 already held initially and it is terminal, there are no successor states at all in the run you have.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p). It is true in any state (whenever event1 holds, it implies itself).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Means C1 is true in every state (a global/always operator). Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Means there is some state (possibly the current one, under standard temporal semantics) where C2 holds. Because C2 holds in all states including the initial state, C3 is satisfied immediately.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" This asserts that in the immediate successor state C4 is true.

4) How they relate and the conclusion about C5
- We already have C4 = false in the initial state (because C3 holds).
- There are no successor states (event1 is terminal), so the ""next"" state does not exist. Under standard temporal semantics (e.g., LTL: X φ requires a real successor j = i+1 and is false at a state with no successor), X(C4) is false at the initial state. Even if one tried to evaluate C4 at a non-existent next state, there is no state where C4 can be true, so C5 is false.
- Therefore C5 is False.

Note on semantics: this conclusion uses the usual interpretation of ""next"" (it requires an actual successor state; if none, X φ is false) and of ""eventually"" (exists j ≥ current such that φ holds). If you use nonstandard definitions (e.g., ""eventually"" meaning strictly later and one takes different conventions for terminal states), the truth of intermediate Cs might be discussed differently, but with the common conventions above C5 is definitively false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 holds initially and is terminal, so there is no next state. C4 is the negation of an already-true C3, so C4 is false in the initial state. With no successor, the ""next"" operator X(C4) is false under standard semantics, so C5 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (so at the initial moment event2 is true).
  
Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"": whenever event1 occurs, the system reaches a terminal state with no further events.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"": whenever event2 occurs, the system reaches a terminal state with no further events.
- Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 nothing can happen, the system is already in a terminal state and no further events can occur.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., event1 is never true at any time)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., it is false that event1 does not happen — equivalently, event1 does happen at some time)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future time C2 becomes true)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (i.e., C3 is false)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (i.e., it is false that C3 does not hold — equivalently, C3 holds)

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no further events can occur, event1 never happens. Therefore C1 is true.
- If C1 is true then C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false.
- C2 is false now and, since no events or state changes can occur after the initial state, C2 will never become true; so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- C3 is false, so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.
- C4 is true, so C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start (it is true initially).

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Meaning: whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards (so event2 → eventually event1).
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Meaning: once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur thereafter — event1 is terminal.

3) What each sub-condition (Ci) means
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (i.e. event2 occurs at all relevant times / in every state)
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → C1.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" (conjunction)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (C3 is true at all times)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (¬C4)

4) How these relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition and Rule B: event1 already happened and is terminal, so no further events can occur after that. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial state.
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false, because event2 does not (and cannot) occur.
- C2 (""if event2 happens then C1"") is true vacuously: since event2 never actually happens, the implication holds.
- C3 (""event1 happens and C2"") is true at the initial state: event1 did happen and C2 is true.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false: C3 contains ""event1 happens"", which is only true at the initial moment; after that no events can occur, so C3 is not true at all times.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is therefore true (since C4 is false).

Conclusion: C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Two instantaneous events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events (interpreting ""after X, Y must happen"" as “whenever X occurs, Y must eventually occur”):
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, event2 must eventually occur. (Formally: G(event1 -> F event2).)
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, event1 must eventually occur. (Formally: G(event2 -> F event1).)

3) What each sub-condition means:
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Interpreted as: at every time point from now on, event2 holds (G event2). In the instant-event model this means event2 occurs at every moment.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” Logical negation of C1 (¬C1).
- C3: “C2 always holds.” C2 is true at every time (G ¬C1).
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” At some point (possibly now) C3 becomes true (F C3).
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” Negation of C4 (¬C4).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial event1 and the two rules, the system is forced into an infinite alternation: event1 (initial) → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... . Both events occur infinitely often but neither holds continuously at every moment.
- Therefore C1 (G event2) is false: event2 is not true at the moments when event1 occurs.
- C2 (¬C1) is true initially.
- C2 remains true forever (there is never a point from which event2 holds at all future times, because event1 will keep occurring), so C3 (G C2) is true.
- Since C3 is already true now, C4 (F C3) is true (it holds eventually, in fact immediately).
- C5 (¬C4) is therefore false.

Final conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs only intermittently (alternating with event1), so C1 (G event2) is false, hence C2 (¬C1) is true at every time (C3), so C4 holds, making C5 (¬C4) false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. So in the next state after S0 (call it S1) event2 occurs.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so after S1 there are no further events).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (false in any state where event2 occurs)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (material implication: event1 → C1)
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (C2 → C3)
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" (i.e., C4 is true in S1)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- In S1 (the next state after S0) event2 does happen (by the transition rule).
- Therefore C3 (and C1) is false in S1.
- In S1, event1 does not happen (it happened in S0), so the antecedent of C2 is false in S1; thus C2 is true in S1 (material implication with false antecedent is true).
- C4 is (C2 → C3). In S1 this is (true → false), which evaluates to false.
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state (S1); since C4 is false in S1, C5 is false.

Hence C5 is False.

(If you intended a different semantics for ""if … then"" or a different notion of ""next state"", mention that and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

In the next state (S1) event2 occurs, so C3 (and C1) is false there. C2 is true in S1 (its antecedent event1 is false), so C4 = (C2 → C3) is (true → false) = false in S1. C5 asserts C4 holds in the next state, so C5 is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: no events can occur at any time after event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur at some later (or subsequent) point.

Given event1 already happened and is terminal, there is no time after the initial moment when any other event (including event2) can occur. So event2 cannot occur.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event2 happens — logically equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2: same as C1 (also ""event2 happens"").
- C3: If C1 then C2 (C1 → C2). Since C1 and C2 are identical, this implication is true whenever we evaluate it as a material implication.
- C4: event2 happens or C3 holds (event2 ∨ C3).
- C5: C4 does not hold (¬C4).

4) Evaluation and relations
- event2 is false (cannot occur after the initial terminal event1).
- Therefore C1 = false and C2 = false.
- C3 = (false → false) = true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C4 = (event2 ∨ C3) = (false ∨ true) = true.
- C5 = ¬C4 = false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

(If one allowed events to occur before the ""initial"" moment, different readings could change the result; under the usual reading that ""initially event1 happened"" fixes the starting point and no events can follow, the above is the correct evaluation.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 is terminal so event2 cannot occur (C1/C2 false). Then C3 (false → false) is true, so C4 = event2 ∨ C3 = true, hence C5 = ¬C4 is false."

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial moment).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., once event1 occurs, no further events occur afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (i.e., once event2 occurs, no further events occur afterward).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both must be true).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" (i.e., event1 and C1 true).
- C3: same as C2 (Event1 happens and C1 holds).
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" (both C2 and C3 true).

4) How they relate (reasoning)
- Because event1 has already happened initially and the rule says no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen at any later time. Therefore event2 does not happen.
- C1 requires event2 to happen, so C1 is false.
- Since C1 is false, C2 and C3 (which require C1) are false.
- C4 requires both C2 and C3; since they are false, C4 is false.

Note on edge cases: if one allowed simultaneous occurrence (event1 and event2 at the exact same instant) or allowed events before the ""initial"" moment, conclusions could differ. Under the standard reading given (event1 happened initially and ""after"" means any later events are prohibited), C4 is False.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: E2 has happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After any occurrence of E2, E1 must happen (i.e. whenever E2 occurs, some later E1 will occur).
- After any occurrence of E1, E2 must happen.
- Starting from the initial E2, these rules force an infinite alternation: E2 → E1 → E2 → E1 → ...

So both E1 and E2 occur (in fact infinitely often).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (repetition is redundant).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 ≡ E1, C2 ≡ E1 ∧ E1 ≡ E1. So C2 is also equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ ◇C3 (there exists some future point where C3 is true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" ≡ ¬◇C3 (i.e. C3 never becomes true).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From (2) we know E1 does happen (indeed infinitely often). Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.
- Hence C3 = ¬C2 is false, and it never becomes true, so C4 (◇C3) is false.
- Therefore C5 = ¬C4 is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: starting from the initial E2 and the two rules, E1 occurs (in fact infinitely often). Thus C1 (""E1 and E1"") is true, so C2 (""E1 and C1"") is true. Therefore C3 (¬C2) is false and never becomes true, so C4 (◇C3) is false, and C5 (¬C4) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).
- Additional rules: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So each of event1 and event2, if they occur, are terminal — no further events occur after them.

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event1 occurs at some time, then no event may occur after that time.
- If event2 occurs at some time, then no event may occur after that time.
- Since event2 happened initially, nothing can occur after that point; in particular event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is tautological repetition but reduces to ""event2 happens."" Given the initial condition, event2 does happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This requires both C1 (true) and that event1 happens. But event1 does not happen (because event2 happened initially and is terminal), so C2 is False.
- C3: same as C2 (it is written identically), so C3 is also False.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" That requires both C2 and C3 to be true; since both are false, C4 is False.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 is true (because event2 happened).
- C2 and C3 both require event1 to have happened; given the initial event2 and the terminal rule, event1 did not happen, so C2 and C3 are false.
- Therefore C4 (C2 and C3) is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.
- Extra constraints: after event2 happens no other events can happen; after event1 happens no other events can happen. So whichever of event1 or event2 occurs, that terminates further events. Since event2 has already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can ever occur.

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminating: once either has occurred, no events can occur afterwards.
- Because event2 occurred initially, the system is in a post-event2 state with no possibility of any subsequent events.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (Either read as ""event1 holds at every state"" or as ""event1 occurs on every run/eventual occurrence"". In either reading, given event1 never occurs here, C1 is false.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" The negation of C1.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Means at some time (possibly now) C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" Conjunction of C3 being true and event1 occurring.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" The next-state operator applied to C4.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- C1: False (event1 does not and cannot happen because event2 already happened and prevents further events).
- C2: True (negation of C1).
- C3: True (C2 already holds in the initial state, so “eventually C2” is satisfied immediately).
- C4: False (although C3 is true, event1 never happens, so the conjunction fails).
- C5: False (C4 does not hold now, and it cannot hold in the next state either because event1 can never occur after the initial event2).

Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 already happened and forbids any further events, so event1 cannot occur; thus C4 (which requires event1) cannot hold now or in the next state, making C5 false."

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen (i.e., event2 implies that a later event1 occurs).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: no subsequent event2 or any other event).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C2: same as C1 (given text repeats it).
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is equivalent to C1 (i.e., event2 eventually happens).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — there will be some future time at which C3 is true (i.e., at some future time event2 eventually happens).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — at every time point C4 is true.

4) How these relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any future time. (The only way event2 could satisfy the implication ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is if event2 had occurred strictly before the initial event1, but no such occurrence is given.)
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false (event2 does not eventually happen), so C3 is false.
- C4 (""eventually C3"") is false because C3 will never become true in any future time.
- C5 (""always C4"") is false because C4 is already false (so it is not true at every time).

Conclusion: C5 is False. (If you intended a different temporal ordering — e.g., event2 could have occurred before the initial event1 — state that explicitly and the answer may change.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: since event1 has already occurred and no events can occur afterward, event2 can never eventually happen, so C1/C2/C3/C4 are false and thus ""C4 always holds"" (C5) is false."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.
- Important consequence given: once event1 has happened, no other events can ever happen afterwards. So from the initial state onward there are no further events (event1 does not occur again and event2 never occurs).

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 occurs the system has no further event occurrences.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 were to occur, then at some later point event1 must occur. (This rule is irrelevant here because, under the first rule, event2 never occurs.)

3) What each sub-condition means (formal/intuitive)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (X event1)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (F C1) — there exists some future state from which the immediate-next state has event1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" (X C2) — in the immediate next state, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (¬C3)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (G C4) — at every state, C4 is true.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event1 already happened initially and no further events can happen, event1 will not happen in the next state (nor in any later state). Therefore C1 is false in the initial state and in every state.
- Since C1 is false in every state, there is no future state where C1 becomes true, so C2 is false in every state.
- Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 (which asks whether C2 is true in the next state) is false in every state.
- C4 is ¬C3, so C4 is true in every state.
- C5 says C4 holds always. Because C4 is indeed true in every state, C5 is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

Reasoning (concise):
- Let s0 be the initial state (event1 happened). By the context, no events occur in any successor states s1, s2, ...
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false at every state, because event1 happened only at s0 and does not occur in any s_{n+1}.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false at s0 because C1 is false at s1.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true at s0 (since C2 is false).
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true at s0 because C3 is true at s1 (the same pattern repeats: C1 false ⇒ C2 false ⇒ C3 true at each successor).
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is therefore true at s0 because C4 is true at s1.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it s0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. So from any state where event1 occurs (e.g. s0), the next state (s1) has event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. So from a state with event2 (e.g. s1), the next state (s2) has event1.
(Thus the system alternates: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, ...)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (next state relative to the initial state s0).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 and C3 — since C2 and C3 are the same claim, C4 is just the same claim repeated (i.e. event1 in the next state).
- C5: C1 or C4 — logically equivalent to C1 (because C4 ≡ C1, so C1 ∨ C4 ≡ C1).

4) How they relate and truth value
- From the initial state s0 we know s1 must have event2 (by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen""). Therefore event1 does NOT happen in the next state s1. So C1 is false; hence C2 and C3 are false; C4 (C2 ∧ C3) is false; and C5 (C1 ∨ C4) is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

Answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the start of consideration event2 is true/has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is absorbing).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is absorbing).
Given the initial occurrence of event2 and the rule that nothing can happen after event2, there are no further events after the initial moment.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" This is a disjunction about whether either event occurs.
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 claims the negation of C2.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" So C4 requires both the disjunction (C1) and the negation of that disjunction (C3) — i.e., a contradiction.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" There exists some time (now or later) at which C4 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the initial condition, event2 does happen, so the disjunction in C1 and C2 is true. Therefore C1 = True and C2 = True.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 = False.
- C4 = C1 AND C3 = True AND False = False.
- Because after event2 no other events can happen, nothing can change in the future to make C3 true or C4 true. Thus C4 will never become true at any later time.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is False.

Concise conclusion: C5 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Initially event2 has occurred, so C1 and C2 are true. C3 is ¬C2, so false, making C4 (C1 ∧ C3) false. No further events can occur after event2, so C4 can never become true; hence C5 (""eventually C4"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (the trace starts with event2 having occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So whichever of the two occurs, the system stops and no further events occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1 → ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: C1 and C2 → ""Event1 happens"" AND ""Event1 happens"", which is just ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: same as C1 → ""Event1 happens"".
- C5: C3 or C4 → ""Event1 happens"" (since both C3 and C4 are equivalent to ""Event1 happens"").

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final truth value)?
- All Ci essentially assert that event1 happens.
- But the actual system state is: event2 happened initially, and because event2 is terminal, no further events (including event1) can happen afterward.
- Therefore event1 does not occur in the trace. Hence every Ci that asserts event1 happens is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- Because event1 happened and the context says “after event1, no other events can happen,” no other events can occur after that — in particular event2 does not happen (so event2 is false).

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event2, event1 must happen” is the implication event2 → event1.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” together with the fact event1 already happened implies event2 is false (event2 did not occur).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. Formally C1 = (event2 → event1).
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens. C2 = C1 ∨ event1.
- C3: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. C3 = (event2 → event1) (same as C1).
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds. C4 = C2 ∨ C3.
- C5: C4 holds and event2 happens. C5 = C4 ∧ event2.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth evaluation
- Evaluate C1: event2 is false, so the implication event2 → event1 is vacuously true. Thus C1 = True.
- Evaluate C2: C1 is True, and event1 is also True; so C2 = True ∨ True = True.
- Evaluate C3: same as C1, so C3 = True.
- Evaluate C4: C2 ∨ C3 = True ∨ True = True.
- Evaluate C5: C4 is True but event2 is False, so C5 = True ∧ False = False.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it is true initially).

2) Transition rules between events (given):
- After event2, event1 must happen. Logically: event2 → event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That makes event1 a terminal event (no further transitions after event1).

3) What each sub-condition means and its truth value under the given rules:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is exactly the rule event2 → event1, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" This is C1 ∨ event2. Since C1 is True (and event2 is also true initially), C2 is True.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" This is event1 → C2. Because C2 is already True, the implication is True (a true consequent makes the implication true). So C3 is True.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This duplicates C1, so C4 is True.

4) How they relate and final answer:
- C5 is ""C3 holds and C4 holds"" = C3 ∧ C4. Both conjuncts are True, therefore C5 is True.

Short answer: C4 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
Because event1 already happened initially, there are no transitions out of the initial state.

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the immediate successor state, event2 happens.
- C3: identical to C2 (same meaning).
- C4: C2 or C3 — equivalently ""C1 holds in the next state.""

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Since event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur now or in any successor (there are no successors).
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 does not happen), so C2 and C3 are false, and thus C4 (C2 or C3) is false.

If you use a different semantics for ""next state"" (for example, treating a non-changing stuttering successor as a next state), the conclusion is the same: there is never a state where event2 has happened, so C1, C2, C3 and hence C4 are false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it S0) event1 holds.

(I'm assuming the usual next-state reading of ""after"" and the usual global reading of ""always"".)

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — whenever event1 holds in some state, event2 holds in the next state. Formally: event1 at state n => event2 at state n+1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — whenever event2 holds in some state, event1 holds in the next state. Formally: event2 at state n => event1 at state n+1.
- These two rules force the events to alternate: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, … .

3) Meaning of the C-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the proposition event1 => event1, a tautology; whenever event1 holds the implication is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true in every state (global truth).
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Because C2 holds everywhere, C3 is equivalent to just ""event2 holds"" in that state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This asserts that event2 holds in every state (plus C2, which is already global). So C4 is the claim that event2 is true in all states.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" This claims that, in the next state (S1), C4 is true (i.e., from S1 onward event2 holds in every state).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the alternation produced by the transition rules, event2 does not hold in every state: it holds in S1, S3, … but not in S0, S2, …. So C3 is true in states where event2 holds (S1, S3, …) but false in states where event1 holds (S0, S2, …).
- Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"" / ""event2 holds in every state"") is false.
- C5 asserts that C4 is true in the next state. Since C4 is false in every state (including S1), C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: events alternate (S0:event1, S1:event2, S2:event1, ...). C4 asserts event2 holds in every state (G event2), which is false. C5 (X C4) asks whether C4 holds in the next state (i.e., at S1); it does not, so C5 is False."

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.

2) Transition rules (what can happen after what):
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
So event1 is terminal: once it has happened, nothing else (including event2) can happen thereafter.

3) What each sub-condition means:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (there exists some future time at which event2 occurs)
- C2: same as C1 (literally the same statement).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is a tautological implication (it is true: if event2 eventually happens then event2 eventually happens).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" So C4 says: C3 ⇒ (event2 happens). Because C3 is true, C4 is equivalent to just saying ""event2 happens.""
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" i.e., at some time C4 is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation:
- Because event1 already happened and no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen now or in the future. Therefore C1 is false (and so is C2).
- C3 is true (vacuously/tautologically true).
- C4 reduces to ""event2 happens,"" which is false.
- C5 (""eventually C4"") is false because C4 never becomes true.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.
- Additional constraint: once event1 has happened, no other events can happen after that time.

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means that in every state strictly after a state in which event1 occurred, no events occur. Because event1 occurs initially, that means no events can occur in any later state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means if event2 ever occurs, then (in the future) event1 must occur. This is an implication about futures after event2.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — i.e. event2 holds at all times (globally).
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — equivalent to saying the property C2 is true in all states (so again that event2 always happens).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate next state, C3 is true (so in the next state event2 would have to always happen thereafter).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — both C1 and C4 must be true.

4) How these relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur in any later state. Given the initial state already has event1, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any time (unless one allows simultaneous occurrence at the same instant — see note below). So event2 does not always happen; in fact event2 does not happen at all.
- Therefore C1 (and C2, C3, C4) are false. Since C5 is the conjunction of C1 and C4, C5 is false.

(Note on an alternate interpretation: if you allowed event2 to co-occur at the exact same initial instant as event1, then it might be possible for event2 to occur at that single instant, but ""always happens"" (C1) requires event2 at every time, which still fails because at later times no events occur. So C1 and hence C5 remain false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 has already occurred and prevents any further events, so event2 cannot hold at all (hence cannot hold ""always""). Thus C1 (and therefore C2–C4) are false, so C5 (C1 and C4) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (so ""event1 happens"" is true at least at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 occurs then event1 will occur (E2 → E1).
- After event1, event2 must happen → if event1 occurs then event2 will occur (E1 → E2).
- From the initial E1 and the rules we get E2 will occur, and from E2 we get E1 (so both events do occur).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: E2 ∨ E1 (event2 happens or event1 happens). Given initial E1, C1 is true.
- C2: E2 ∨ C1. Logically this is E2 ∨ (E2 ∨ E1) which simplifies to E2 ∨ E1 — so C2 is equivalent to C1, hence true.
- C3: E2 ∨ E1 — same as C1, so true.
- C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds (C2 → C3). Since C2 and C3 are equivalent (and both true), C4 is true.
- C5: C4 does not hold (¬C4).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because C2 and C3 are the same proposition (E2 ∨ E1) and that proposition is true, the implication C2 → C3 (C4) is true.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition (call it state s0): event2 has happened.
- From s0 we move to a next state s1 where event1 must happen. After event1 (in s1) no further events occur (s1 is terminal).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen: so there is a transition s0 -> s1 and event1 holds in s1.
- After event1, no other events can happen: s1 is terminal (no s2 where other events occur).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (evaluated at the current state, which is s0 unless otherwise noted)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a conjunction that amounts to ""event1 happens."" C1 is false in s0 (event1 has not yet happened) and true in s1.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is true in any state where either C1 is false or event1 holds. In particular C2 is true in s0 (antecedent false → vacuously true) and true in s1 (antecedent true and consequent true).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Evaluated in s0, the next state is s1; since C2 is true in s1, C3 is true in s0.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Same as C1. Evaluated in s0 this is false (event1 does not yet happen in the initial state).
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" This is the conjunction of C3 and C4 evaluated in the current state (s0).

4) How they relate (final evaluation)
- In s0: C3 is true (because C2 is true in s1), but C4 is false (event1 does not hold in s0). Therefore C5 = C3 AND C4 = true AND false = false.

So C5 is False. (If you instead evaluated everything at s1, C4 and C1 would be true there, but C3 at s1 would ask about C2 in the next state of s1 which does not exist under the given model.)

Short answer: C5 is True (under the usual reading that events are instantaneous and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" means the system does nothing after the initial event).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event1 occurred.

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred, no further events occur thereafter.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — similarly, if event2 occurs, no further events occur.
- Because event1 already occurred initially, the first rule implies no further events (so event2 never occurs at any future state).

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — i.e. at every state from now on event1 holds (G event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — there is some future state from which C1 (that event1 always holds) is true (F C1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — F C2.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — X C3.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — ¬C4.

(These are standard temporal-logic readings; if you intended different semantics say so.)

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- Because only one instantaneous occurrence of event1 is known (initially) and no further events occur, event1 is not guaranteed to hold at every future state — C1 is false.
- If C1 is false at the initial state and no future state can make it true forever, C2 (F C1) is also false.
- Then C3 (F C2) is false, and C4 (X C3) is false.
- Therefore C5 = ¬C4 is true.

Note on an alternative reading: if you instead interpret ""event1 happened"" as a persistent fact that remains true forever after occurrence, then C1 would be true, making C2, C3 and C4 true and C5 false. The answer above assumes the conventional instantaneous-event interpretation.

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So: event1 → event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So: event2 → event1.)
These rules imply an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (C1 ≡ event1 → event2.)
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Same as C1.)
- C3: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Same again.)
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds. Given C2 and C3 are the same implication, C4 is true if at least one of those identical implications holds.
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds. (C5 ≡ (event1 → event2) AND (C2 ∨ C3).)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the transition rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we conclude event1 → event2 is true. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2 and C3 express the same implication, so they are also true.
- C4 = (C2 ∨ C3) is true because at least one (in fact both) of C2 and C3 is true.
- C5 = C1 ∧ C4 is therefore true ∧ true, so C5 is True.

(Notes: C2 and C3 are redundant copies of C1; the initial occurrence of event1 is consistent with the implications but not needed to establish the logical truth of the implications.)

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Since event2 happened initially and it is terminal, there are no further states after the initial state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 holds now."" True in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This requires a successor state where C1 is true. There is no next state (trace ends), so C2 is false (standard next-operator semantics: X p is false at a terminal state).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false now and will never become true (no future states), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication C4 → event1. Since C4 is false, the implication is true by vacuous truth.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- The chain collapses because the system stops immediately after the initial event2. C1 is true, but all temporal statements requiring any future state (C2, C3, C4) are false. C5 is true only because its antecedent C4 is false; that makes the conditional true even though event1 never actually occurs.

Summary truth values: C1 = True, C2 = False, C3 = False, C4 = False, C5 = True.

True

Short answer: C5 is False (under the natural reading that each plain ""happens"" refers to the current state and only C2 quantifies ""in the next state"").

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the immediate next state after an event2-state contains event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (evaluated at the initial state unless a temporal qualifier is given)
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — redundant; equivalent to ""event2 happens"". At the initial state this is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In the next state, by the transition rule, event1 happens (not event2), so C1 is False in the next state. Therefore C2 is False (at the initial state).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" At the initial state C2 is False and event1 does not happen in the initial state (it happens only in the next state), so C3 is False.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Event2 is True initially but C3 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 is False, so C5 is False.

4) How they relate
- The chain shows C1 True, but because event2 is immediately followed by event1 (and not another event2), C2 fails, which makes C3, C4, and finally C5 all fail. So C5 is False.

Note on an alternate reading: if you instead read the unqualified ""event1 happens"" in C3 as referring to the next state (or to the future) rather than the current state, then C3 would be True (because event1 does happen next), and then C4 and C5 would become True. But given that C2 explicitly said ""in the next state"" while the others did not, the conventional interpretation is that the plain ""happens"" expressions are current-state claims — yielding C5 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: In the initial state event2 is true so C1 is true. But the next state has event1 (not event2), so C1 does not hold there and C2 is false. Hence C3 (C2 or event1 in the initial state) is false, making C4 and therefore C5 false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (the system starts in a state where event1 occurred).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (a terminal/absorbing state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (also terminal).
So any state in which event1 or event2 has occurred is terminal: no further events occur after that point.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (i.e., at some future point from the initial state).
- C2: same as C1 (a duplicate).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (from the immediate successor state, event2 will eventually happen).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (there is some future state at which C3 is true).
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds"" (either event2 eventually happens now, or at some later point C3 becomes true).

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the initial state event1 has happened and that state is terminal (no further events). Therefore event2 cannot happen at any future point. So C1 and C2 are false.
- Because no further events occur, the next state (and any later state) cannot satisfy C2, so C3 is false and C3 will never become true, hence C4 is false.
- C5 = C1 or C4 = False or False = False.

Reason: C3 (always C2) forces event1 to hold in every state (since event1 holds initially and C2 requires event1 in the next state, globally).

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
- Starting from the initial event2, these rules force an alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … so event2 does occur (indeed infinitely often).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (interpreted as “event2 never happens”).
- C2: “C1 does not hold” = ¬C1, i.e. “Event2 does happen” (the negation of C1).
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens” = (¬C1) ∨ event2.
- C4: “C3 always holds” (C3 is true at every time).
- C5: “C4 always holds” (C4 is true at every time).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event2 did happen initially (and will keep happening by the transition rules), C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 = ¬C1 is true.
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2 is true (already true because C2 is true).
- Since C2 is a global fact (¬C1) and thus true at all times, C3 is true at all times, so C4 is true.
- If C4 is true, then “C4 always holds” (C5) is also true.

Therefore C5 is True.

True

Short answers up front: C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = True, C4 = False, and C5 = True (assuming the usual reading of “after … must happen” as guaranteeing the later event will occur).

Step‑by‑step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the initial time).

2) Transition rules between events?
- “After event2, event1 must happen” — whenever event2 occurs it is followed (at some later time or the next state) by event1.
- “After event1, event2 must happen” — whenever event1 occurs it is followed (later or next) by event2.
So with event1 true initially, the rules force event2 to occur later, then event1 again, etc. (an alternating sequence).

3) What does each Ci mean?
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (This matches the “after event2, event1 must happen” rule.)
- C2: Event1 happens AND C1 holds. (Both the fact event1 happens and the implication in C1 are true.)
- C3: C2 eventually holds. (At some time C2 is true.)
- C4: C3 does not hold. (Negation of C3.)
- C5: C4 holds OR event2 happens. (Disjunction of ¬C3 and the occurrence of event2.)

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- C1: True by the given rule.
- C2: True now (event1 holds initially and C1 is true).
- C3: True — since C2 already holds now, it certainly “eventually” holds.
- C4: False — it asserts ¬C3, but C3 is true.
- C5: C4 OR event2. Since C4 is false, C5 reduces to “event2 happens.” Given the transition rule “after event1, event2 must happen” and that event1 already happened initially, event2 will (eventually) happen. Therefore C5 is true (at least eventually). 

Caveat about timing/semantics: if you evaluate C5 at the exact initial instant before event2 has occurred yet, then C5 might be false at that instant (because C4 is false and event2 hasn’t happened yet). But under the given rules event2 must occur at some later time, so C5 becomes true (and is true if you interpret these statements as about eventual occurrence).

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 has happened (so event1 is true initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted as: whenever event2 occurs at some state, there must be an occurrence of event1 in a later state (or at least in the next state, depending on reading).
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Interpreted as: once event1 has occurred in a state, no event (neither event1 nor event2) occurs in any subsequent state. In other words, a state that has event1 is terminal with respect to events.

(Also assume standard linear discrete-time semantics where ""in the next state"" refers to the immediate successor state; if no successor exists then an ""X"" / ""next"" condition is false.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" (Both true in the same state or both hold in the considered state.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" (So requires event2 and event1, and yet another event2 — effectively still dependent on event2 happening.)
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" (Disjunction of event2 and C2.)
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" (The immediate successor state satisfies C3.)
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" (Both event1 in the current state and C3 in the next state.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth-values under the given context?
- From the initial condition and Rule B, once event1 has happened initially, no events can occur in any subsequent states. Therefore event2 does not (and cannot) occur in any later state.
- C1 requires event2; since event2 never occurs, C1 is False.
- C2 requires C1 and event2; since C1 is False (and event2 is absent) C2 is False.
- C3 is ""event2 or C2""; both disjuncts are False, so C3 is False in every state.
- C4 requires C3 to hold in the next state. But C3 is False in the next state (there are no events there), so C4 is False.
- C5 requires event1 (True initially) AND C4 (False). A conjunction with a false conjunct is False. Therefore C5 is False.

Notes on ambiguities: If you intended different temporal semantics (e.g., ""after"" meaning ""at some past time"" or allowing events to co-occur differently), please specify and I can re-evaluate. Under the natural reading above (initial event1, event1 makes future states event-free, ""next"" = immediate successor), C5 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 is true initially and by ""after event1, no other events can happen"" no events (including event2) can occur in any later state. So C3 is false in the next state, hence C4 is false, and therefore the conjunction C5 (event1 ∧ C4) is false."

Answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If/when event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards (i.e., any path that has event2 is followed by event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — there are no outgoing transitions).

Because event1 already happened initially and is terminal, the system has no further states/transitions.

3) What each sub-condition means?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1). This is true in the initial/only state because event1 already occurred (eventually includes the current state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1). This asks whether in every reachable state C1 is true. There is only the initial state, and C1 is true there, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (¬C2). Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3). Because C3 is false now and there are no future states that could make it true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4). There is no next state (event1 is terminal). Under the usual temporal semantics where X p is false at a state with no successor, X C4 is false. Even ignoring that, C4 is false in all reachable states, so C5 is false.

4) How the conditions relate:
- C1 is true initially -> so C2 (that C1 holds in all states) is true because the only state satisfies C1.
- C3 asserts ¬C2, so it contradicts reality and is false.
- Therefore C4 and C5, which depend on C3 becoming true or being true next, are false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, the next state must have event2.
- After event2 occurs, the next state must have event1.
These rules force an alternating sequence of events starting from s0:
s0: event2
s1: event1
s2: event2
s3: event1
… and so on, alternating forever.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (evaluated at a given state s, C1 refers to the immediate successor of s.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1 at the current state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = from the current state onward, C2 is true at every future state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" = from the current state onward, C3 is true at every future state.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" = there exists some future state at which C4 is true.

4) How they relate (truth along the trace)
- On the alternating trace above, C1 alternates: false at s0 (since s1 has event1), true at s1 (since s2 has event2), false at s2, true at s3, etc.
- Therefore C2 = not C1 also alternates (true at s0, false at s1, true at s2, ...).
- For C3 to hold at some state s, C2 would have to be true at s and at every future state. But C2 is not stable; it is false at every other state, so there is no state from which C2 holds forever. Hence C3 is false at every state.
- If C3 never holds at any state, then C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false at every state.
- Consequently, C4 never holds at any future state, so ""eventually C4 holds"" (C5) is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the system forces an infinite alternation (event2, event1, event2, ...), so C2 alternates and never holds always; hence C3 never holds at any state, so C4 never holds, and therefore C5 (""eventually C4"") is false."

Summary answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (at the start).

2) Transition/temporal rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterwards).

Given rule A and the initial event1, no other events can ever occur after the start; in particular event2 cannot occur at any time.

3) What each condition means (truth values under the above)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" — False (event2 cannot happen at all).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — True (negation of C1).
- C3: ""Event2 always happens."" — Same as C1, so False.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" — This is (True → False), so False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — Since C4 is false, C5 is False.

4) How they relate
- Because event1 occurs initially and forbids any later events, event2 never happens; that makes C1/C3 false and C2 true. The implication C2 → C3 is then false, so the universal claim C5 that C4 always holds is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 occurs initially and forbids any later events, so event2 never happens. Thus C1 (and C3) are false and C2 is true, making the implication C4 (C2 → C3) false; therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is True).
- Also given: after event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen; event2 is False.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur. So event2 is prevented.
- (""After event2, no other events can happen"" is also stated but irrelevant since event2 never occurs.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value)?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Since event2 is False, C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally (C1 → C2). Since C1 and C2 are identical, this implication is true (and in particular any implication with a false antecedent is true). So C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 is True and event1 is True, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" Formally (C4 → event2). Here C4 is True but event2 is False, so the implication is False.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 both assert event2; both are false because event1 prevents any further events.
- C3 is a vacuously/tautologically true implication given C1 = C2.
- C4 combines the true C3 with the true fact that event1 happened, so C4 is true.
- C5 then asserts that from C4 we get event2, but since event2 does not happen, C5 is false.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, no other events can ever happen afterwards (event1 is terminal).
- If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur after that (but this is irrelevant given the initial event1 and its terminal property).

3) Meaning of each condition

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some time in the future (possibly now) C1 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some time in the future (possibly now) C2 is true.
- C4: ""event2 happens or C3 holds"" — either event2 occurs or C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — the negation of C4.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- event1 already happened initially, so C1 is true (the ""or"" is satisfied by event1).
- If C1 is already true, then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true.
- If C2 is true now, then ""eventually C2"" (C3) is true as well.
- C3 being true makes C4 true (C4 is event2 or C3).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so event1 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (Formally: event1 -> event2.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal). Rule B does not contradict A; it just ends the sequence after event2.
- Therefore the only possible sequence consistent with the rules is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, then nothing else.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly Rule A (event1 -> event2). Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event1 -> C1. C1 is the proposition (event1 -> event2). In the context C1 is true, so the implication event1 -> C1 is true. (Concretely: event1 is true and C1 is true, so the implication holds.)
- C3: Same as C2 (a duplicate). It is also true for the same reason.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" This is the conjunction of two true statements, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate
- C1 is the basic rule given by the context.
- C2 and C3 assert that when event1 occurs, the rule C1 is in force; since C1 is already true, both implications hold.
- C4 is the conjunction of C2 and C3, hence true.

- Initially event2 happened, so C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false at the initial state.
- C2 (C1 → event2) is therefore vacuously true at the initial state.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so in the next state event2 does not happen; at that next state C1 is true while event2 is false, making C2 false there.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time t0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen at some later time.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen at some later time.
- Together with the initial event1, these rules force an infinite alternation: e1 at t0, e2 at some t1>t0, e1 at t2>t1, e2 at t3>t2, … So event2 does occur (in fact infinitely often), though not at t0.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (reading ""happens"" as “occurs at the current time” and “eventually” as the usual temporal eventually)
- C1: “Event2 always happens” (i.e., holds at every time). This is false: at t0 event1 happened, not event2.
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens (now).” At t0 both disjuncts are false, so C2 is false at t0. At the first time event2 actually occurs (t1), C2 is true (because the second disjunct is true).
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” True at t0, because at the soonest time when event2 occurs (t1) C2 becomes true.
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” Since C3 already holds at t0, C4 is also true at t0 (and note that eventually eventually P is equivalent to eventually P).
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” This is false, because C4 does hold.

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- Because event2 will occur after the initial event1, C2 becomes true at that future time, making C3 true now; hence C4 is true, so C5 (which asserts C4 does not hold) is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From initial event1 and the rules G(event1 -> F event2) and G(event2 -> F event1), event2 will occur later, so C4 holds and thus C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (This is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1.)

Because event1 happened initially and it prevents any later events, event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

3) Meaning and truth of each Ci
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Since event2 does not happen, C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication is true: either because C1 logically includes event2 (so C1 → event2 is valid) or because an implication with a false antecedent is true. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is true (disjunction true if one disjunct is true).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Same as C1, so false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" (C3 → C4). C3 is true and C4 is false, so the implication is false.

4) How they relate (summary)
- Event1 occurring initially blocks event2, so any statement requiring event2 is false.
- C2 is vacuously/structurally true; that makes C3 true; but C4 (which requires event2) is false; therefore C5 (C3 → C4) is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 and C4 are false (event2 cannot happen after event1). C2 is true (vacuously), so C3 is true (C2 ∨ event2). Thus C3 is true while C4 is false, making the implication C5 (C3 → C4) false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it S0) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events (interpreting the natural reading as next-state constraints):
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Interpreted as: whenever event1 holds in a state, event2 holds in the immediate next state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Interpreted as: once event2 occurs in a state, in all subsequent states no events occur (so neither event1 nor event2 holds after that point).

(If you intended a different temporal interpretation — e.g. “event2 must happen eventually” rather than “in the next state”, or simultaneous events in one state — the conclusion can change. Below follows the standard discrete next-state reading.)

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: event1 holds in the next state (X event1).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 or C2 — therefore equivalent to X event1.
- C4: C3 always holds (G C3) — i.e. in every state, the next state has event1.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state (X C4) — i.e. in the state after the initial state, it is true that in every state thereafter the next state has event1.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Start at S0: event1 holds (given). By the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", in S1 we must have event2.
- Once S1 has event2, the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" implies that in S2, S3, ... no events occur (so event1 is false in S1 and all future states).
- Therefore at S0, C1 (X event1) is false (because S1 has event2, not event1). So C2 is also false, hence C3 is false in S0.
- C4 is ""always C3""; since C3 is false at least at S0 (and at S1 and later), C4 is false.
- C5 asks whether C4 holds in the next state (S1). C4 is false overall, and in particular it does not hold at S1, so C5 is false.

Conclusion: Under the standard next-state interpretation, C5 is False. (If you meant different temporal semantics, tell me which and I can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Additional rule: after event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Additional rule: after event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event2 occurs at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur.
- If event1 occurs at some time, then no events can occur after that time.
- Since event1 happened initially (and is terminal), no events can occur after that initial moment. That prevents any occurrence of event2 at or after the initial event1; unless one admits events before the “initial” moment, event2 does not occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — logically just ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same literal).
- C2: same as C1 (identical).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" → C3 = not C2.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" → C4 = event2 AND (not C2).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" → C5 = C1 AND C4.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because C1 and C2 are the same formula (both are ""event2 happens""), C2 is true exactly when event2 happens.
- C3 = not C2, so C3 is true exactly when event2 does not happen.
- C4 = event2 AND (not C2). But since C2 ≡ event2, this is event2 AND (not event2), which is a contradiction and always false.
- C5 = C1 AND C4. Since C4 is always false, C5 is always false.

You can also see this from the scenario facts: event1 happened initially and no events can happen after it, so event2 does not happen; therefore C1 and C2 are false, C3 true, C4 false, and C5 false.

Conclusion: C5 is False (indeed, C5 is impossible under the given formulas — C4 is a contradiction).

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 implies event1 happens afterwards).

(These transition rules are background facts but aren’t needed for the logical relations below except to note that event2 does in fact happen in the scenario.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (¬event2)
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" In propositional form: (¬event2) → (¬event2). This is logically true (a tautology).
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" In form: event2 → C3.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" i.e. ¬C4.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C3 is always true because it is of the form p → p.
- Since C3 is true, any implication whose consequent is C3 is true; therefore C4 (event2 → C3) is true.
- C5 asserts that C4 does not hold, but we have established C4 does hold. Hence C5 is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the relevant time/event-state, event1 is true.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 → event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 → event2).
(These rules describe what must follow, but the key fact for the hypothesis is that event1 does happen initially.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (so C1 asserts ¬event1)
- C2: “Event1 does not happen.” (same as C1, ¬event1)
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” Formally C1 → C2. Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is trivially true; also given ¬event1 is actually false (because event1 does happen), the material implication C1 → C2 is true anyway.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” That is ¬C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: “If event1 happens, then C4 holds.” Formally event1 → C4.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- We know event1 is true. C4 is false (¬C3, but C3 is true). So the conditional event1 → C4 has a true antecedent and a false consequent, hence is false under standard (material) implication.
- Therefore C5 is false.

(If you use a different implication semantics than the standard material conditional, mention that—under the usual logic assumptions above, C5 is False.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C3 (C1 → C2) is true, so C4 (¬C3) is false. Since event1 is true and C4 is false, the material implication event1 → C4 (C5) is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has already happened.
- Also given: after event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

2) Transition rules
- If event2 ever happens, it must be followed by event1.
- But because event1 has already happened and no other events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. (The ""after event2 → event1"" rule is then vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — simply equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — equivalent to ""eventually event2 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""(eventually event2) and (event2 now)"" (which reduces to event2 if it is interpreted as happening at some time).
- C4: same as C1, i.e. ""event2 happens.""
- C5: ""C3 or C4"" — since C4 ≡ event2, C5 simplifies to ""event2 happens.""

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Given the initial terminal event1, event2 never happens. Therefore C1, C2, C3, C4 are all false.
- Consequently C5 (which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"") is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it s0) event1 happened.
- Consequence of “After event1, no other events can happen”: once event1 has occurred at some state, in every later state no events occur (neither event1 nor event2).
- Consequence of “After event2, event1 must happen”: if event2 occurs at some state, then event1 must occur in the immediately following state.

Step 2 — transition rules between events (summary)
- Because event1 already happened at s0 and the rule “after event1 no other events can happen” applies, no events can occur in s1, s2, ... (all future states are event-free).
- Therefore event2 can never occur in any future state (there is no allowed place for event2 to happen).
- The rule “after event2 event1 must happen” is vacuously satisfied because event2 never happens.

Step 3 — meanings of C1..C5 (relative to the initial state s0)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — means event2 holds at s1.
- C2: “C1 holds and event1 happens” — means (event2 at s1) AND (event1 happens at the same point intended by the phrase). Either way, it requires C1 to be true.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — means C2 is true at s1 (so it would require event2 at s2, etc.).
- C4: “Event2 happens or C3 holds” — disjunction of event2 at s1 or C3 true at s0.
- C5: “C4 holds and event2 happens” — requires C4 true at s0 and event2 happening (presumably at the relevant next state).

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 is false: event2 cannot happen at s1 because after event1 (at s0) no events can occur in s1.
- C2 is false: it requires C1 to be true; since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 is false: C2 is false at s1 as well (no events happen there), so C3 is false.
- C4 is false: both disjuncts are false (event2 does not happen, and C3 is false).
- C5 is false: it requires event2 to happen and C4 to hold; neither holds.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (the system becomes terminal with respect to events).
- After event1 happens, likewise no other events can happen.
(So whenever either event occurs the run is stuck with respect to further event occurrences. Since event2 already occurred initially, no further events can occur in the future.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there exists some future point where event1 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (in the immediate successor state, it will be true that event1 eventually happens).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (negation of C2).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" (negation of C3).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (there is some future state where C4 is true).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth-values?
- Because event2 occurred initially and no further events can happen after event2, event1 cannot ever happen. Therefore:
  - C1 is False.
  - C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is also False (the next state, if it exists, still has event2 already happened and so C1 is false there).
  - C3 = ¬C2 is therefore True.
  - C4 = ¬C3 is therefore False.
  - C5 = ""eventually C4"" is False because C4 is already false and nothing in the future can change (no events can occur to flip truth values), so C4 will never become true.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurred initially and prevents any further events, so event1 never happens (C1 false). Hence C2 false, C3 true, C4 false, and C4 can never become true in the future, so C5 is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.
- Additional facts: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So any state in which event1 or event2 has occurred is terminal (no further events occur afterwards).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- From the initial state (where event1 has happened) there is no transition that yields any further event — in particular event2 does not happen after the initial event1.
- In general, a state where event1 or event2 has occurred has no successor events. (Under standard temporal semantics, such a state is a last state; the X (“next”) operator is false there because there is no successor.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally (event2 → event2). This is a logical tautology (always true): an implication with the same antecedent and consequent is true in every state where the truth values are evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is false in every state.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" C2 is false, and moreover event2 does not occur in the reachable states (because event1 already happened and stops further events). So C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false in every reachable state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There are two standard ways to see this as false:
  a) If we interpret the initial state as terminal (no successor), then the next-state formula X C4 is false by standard LTL semantics (X φ is false in a state with no successor).
  b) If there is a successor state but no events happen there, C4 is still false in that successor (as argued above), so X C4 is false because C4 is false in the next state.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary)
- C1 is a tautology, so C2 (the negation of C1) is impossible/false.
- Because C2 is false and event2 never occurs after the initial event1, C3 and C4 are false.
- Therefore C5 (C4 in the next state) is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: In the initial (terminal) state event1 has happened so there is no successor. C1 is a tautology, so C2 is false. Hence C3 is false, and since event2 never occurs after event1, C4 (C3 or event2) is false. Finally X C4 (C5) is false in a state with no successor (and would also be false in any successor), so C5 is False."

Step 0 — quick summary answer
- C5 is False (given the stated context and the natural reading that ""Event1 does not happen"" asserts Event1 never happens).

Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (so event1 does occur at least once, at the initial time).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (event1 is terminal — once event1 occurs, no further events occur after that time.)

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — i.e. event1 never occurs.
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 holds and C3 holds — equivalently: event1 does not happen AND event1 does not happen, which is just event1 does not happen.
- C5: C1 holds or C4 holds — equivalently: event1 does not happen OR event1 does not happen, i.e. event1 does not happen.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final evaluation)?
- From the context, event1 did happen initially. Therefore the proposition ""event1 does not happen"" is false.
- So C1 is False. C2 and C3 are also False. Then C4 = C2 ∧ C3 = False ∧ False = False. Then C5 = C1 ∨ C4 = False ∨ False = False.
- Conclusion: C5 is False.

Note on assumptions: I treated ""Event1 does not happen"" as a global claim that event1 never occurs. If you intended a different temporal reading (e.g., ""does not happen after some time t""), please clarify and I can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The context says event1 happened initially, so the statement ""event1 does not happen"" is false (hence C1, C2, C3 all false). Therefore C4 (C2 ∧ C3) is false and C5 (C1 ∨ C4) is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the current state) event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Interpreting ""after X, Y must happen"" as ""if X happens in the current state then Y happens in the next state"", the rules enforce that event1 and event2 alternate: starting from event2 now, the next state is event1, then event2, then event1, ….

3) Meaning of C1–C5
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens (now), then C1 holds"" — i.e. if event1 happens now, then event2 happens in the next state. This exactly restates the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some (possibly the current) future state at which C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — the negation of C3.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — in the next state it is true that C3 does not hold.

4) How they relate and final truth value
- The transition rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" makes C2 true from the start (C2 is true in every state: if event1 occurs then event2 follows; if event1 does not occur the implication is vacuously true).
- Since C2 is already true now, ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is true.
- Therefore C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state; since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Hence C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 is true already (the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" makes the implication hold in every state), so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true, making C4 (""C3 does not hold"") false; therefore C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

Assumptions (clear semantics used)
- Time is a sequence of states S0, S1, S2, ...
- “Next state” means the immediate successor (S_{n+1}).
- An event “happens” at a particular state when it is true in that state.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means: once event2 happens in some state, no events occur in any later state.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (in S0) event2 happened. So event2 is true in S0.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens then event2 must happen (we treat this as: when event1 occurs at some state, event2 occurs in the next state).
- After event2 happens (as in S0), no events occur in any subsequent states (S1, S2, ...).

Given event2 already happened in S0, it follows that no events occur in S1, S2, ...

3) Meaning and evaluation of each Ci (evaluated from S0 unless otherwise stated)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” — that asks whether event2 is true in S1. Since no events occur after S0, event2 is false in S1. So C1 is false (at S0).
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens” — (C1) ∨ (event2 at current state S0). C1 is false, but event2 is true in S0, so C2 is true (at S0).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — this asks whether C2 is true in S1. Evaluate C2 in S1: in S1, event2 is false and C1 (which would be event2 in S2) is also false, so C2 is false in S1. Thus C3 is false (at S0).
- C4: “C3 does not hold” — since C3 is false, C4 is true (at S0).
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state” — this asks whether C4 is true in S1. We need C4 at S1 = ¬(C3 at S1). We already found C3 at S1 is false, so C4 at S1 is true. Therefore C5 is true (at S0).

4) Relations / summary
- Timeline: S0: event2 = true. S1, S2, ...: no events.
- Truth values at S0: C1 = false, C2 = true, C3 = false, C4 = true. C5 is the assertion that C4 is true at S1; since C4 is true at S1, C5 is true.
- Conclusion: C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (time t0) event2 happened. So at t0: event2 = true, event1 = false.

(I'm assuming a simple discrete-time model where at each time step we evaluate which event holds; the given ""after ... must happen"" rules refer to the next time step.)

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state: whenever event2 is true at time t, event1 is true at t+1.
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state: whenever event1 is true at time t, event2 is true at t+1.

These rules force alternating occurrences: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, …

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 does not happen (i.e. event1 = false) — interpreted at the current state.
- C2: If C1 holds then event2 happens (C1 → event2) — a formula evaluated at the current state.
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens (C2 ∧ event2) — evaluated at the current state.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (i.e. X C3).
- C5: C4 always holds (i.e. □C4, C4 is true at every time).

4) How they relate — truth-value evaluation
Evaluate at t0 (initial state): event2 = true, event1 = false.
- C1 at t0: true (event1 does not happen).
- C2 at t0: true (antecedent true and event2 is true).
- C3 at t0: true (C2 true ∧ event2 true).
- C4 at t0: asks whether C3 is true at t1.

Now at t1: by the rules, event1 = true and event2 = false.
- C1 at t1: false (event1 does happen).
- C2 at t1: vacuously true (C1 false → anything).
- C3 at t1: false (C2 true but event2 is false, so C2 ∧ event2 = false).

Therefore C3 is false at t1, so C4 is false at t0. Since C4 fails already at t0, “C4 always holds” (C5) is false.

Conclusion: C5 is false. (If you allow different semantics, e.g. events can co-occur in a state, you could re-evaluate, but under the usual “next-state” alternation implied by the rules the result is as above.)

Reasoning (concise):

- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — True at S0 because C1 holds and event1 occurs at S1.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" — True at S1 (C2 holds at S1 and event1 holds at S1).

- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"" — At S0 the antecedent C4 is true but event1 does not hold at S0 (event2 does), so the implication is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the start-state event2 is true).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: if event1 occurs, no further events occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — event2 is terminal as well.
- Therefore once either event occurs, no other event can occur later.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 happens ∧ event1 happens — equivalent to just ""event1 happens"".
- C2: C1 ∧ event2 happens — equivalent to ""event1 happens ∧ event2 happens"" (both events occur).
- C3: eventually C2 holds — at some future point both event1 and event2 hold simultaneously or have both happened.
- C4: same as C1 (event1 happens).
- C5: C3 ∧ C4 — requires event1 happens now (C4) and at some (possibly same or later) time both event1 and event2 hold (C3).

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- Initially event2 has happened. Since event2 is terminal, no other events can happen after that; in particular event1 cannot happen after the initial event2.
- There is no information that event1 happened earlier or simultaneously. Under the usual linear-time reading (no simultaneous past occurrences given), event1 does not hold.
- Therefore C1 and C4 (which assert event1) are false.
- C2 (both event1 and event2) is false.
- C3 (eventually C2) is false.
- Hence C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is false.

Note (edge case): if your semantics allowed event1 and event2 to have both occurred simultaneously at the initial moment, then C1–C5 could all be true. But given the stated initial condition (""Initially, event2 happened"") and the ""after X no other events can happen"" rules, the intended reading makes C5 false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Since event2 has already occurred and both events are terminal (no other events can happen after either), event1 cannot occur; C4 (which requires event1) is false, so C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially (in every execution/run, the initial state has event1).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so every run that starts with event1 will continue with event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So every permitted run is the sequence: event1 then event2, then stop.

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” (Ambiguity: usually means “in every run/event trace event1 occurs” — I’ll use that reading.)
- C2: “Event1 always happens.” (This is written the same as C1; likely a typo. If intended to be “Event2 always happens,” I will note that below.)
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” (C1 ⇒ C2.)
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” (¬(C1 ⇒ C2).)
- C5: “C4 always holds.” (in every run, C3 does not hold)

4) How they relate and truth values
- Under the literal text (C1 and C2 identical): C1 and C2 are the same statement. If C1 is true then C2 is the same true statement. So C3 (C1 ⇒ C2) is true (it is a tautology when antecedent and consequent are identical). Therefore C4 (the negation of C3) is false, and C5 (“C4 always holds”) is false.

- If the obvious intended reading was C2 = “Event2 always happens”: given the context every run contains event1 followed by event2, so both “event1 occurs in every run” and “event2 occurs in every run” are true. Hence C1 and C2 are true, C3 (C1 ⇒ C2) is true, C4 is false, and C5 is false.

Conclusion: In either the literal reading or the likely intended reading, C5 is false.

If you meant a different formal reading of “always” (e.g., “holds at every moment in time” rather than “occurs in every run”), tell me which temporal interpretation you want and I’ll re-evaluate.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
(So each event, once it has occurred, prevents any further events afterwards.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (both events occur)
- C2: same as C1 (the hypothesis states C2 is identical to C1)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" i.e. not(C2)
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" i.e. C1 and not(C2)
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4)

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Since C2 = C1, C3 = not(C2) = not(C1).
- Thus C4 = C1 and not(C1), which is a contradiction and therefore false in every state.
  (Whether event1 and event2 can occur simultaneously or not doesn't matter for this point: even if C1 were true, C3 would then be false, so C4 is still false.)
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state. Because C4 is always false, C5 is false as well.
  (If your semantics treats ""next"" as undefined when there is no next state, that would likewise prevent C5 from being true; under the usual convention Xφ is false if there is no next state.)

Therefore C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event2 and event1.
- Initially (call that state S0) event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

So the only possible timeline starting from S0 is:
S0: event2 (initial),
S1: event1,
then termination (no further events).

3) Meaning of the C-conditions (given literally)
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” (i.e., event2 occurs in S1)
- C2: “C1 holds and event2 happens.” (conjunction; given C1 already asserts event2 in the next state, C2 is just C1 ∧ event2)
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” (¬C2)
- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” (◊¬C2)
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” (¬◊¬C2)

4) Relations and truth values under the timeline
- In S1 the event is event1, not event2. So C1 is false.
- Because C1 is false, C2 (C1 ∧ event2) is false.
- Therefore C3 = ¬C2 is true (it already holds at S0).
- Since C3 already holds now, “eventually C3” (C4) is true.
- C5 is “C4 does not hold,” so C5 is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the initial moment (so the system starts in a state where event2 already occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards. (event1 ⇒ eventually event2)
- If event2 occurs, no other events can happen afterwards. (event2 is terminal)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to simply ""event1 happens"". (A or A = A)
- C2: same as C1, so also ""event1 happens"".
- C3: C1 and C2 — since both are the same, C3 is again ""event1 happens"".
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — this asserts that at all times (globally) event1 happens.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""C4 ∨ event1"".

4) How do these conditions relate, and what are their truth values given the rules?
- Because the system starts with event2 and event2 is terminal (no other events can happen after it), event1 cannot happen at any time in the run that starts with the given initial condition.
- Therefore:
  - C1 = False (event1 does not happen)
  - C2 = False
  - C3 = False
  - C4 = False (it is not true that ""event1 always holds"")
  - C5 = C4 ∨ event1 = False ∨ False = False

So C5 is False.

(If you allow a different interpretation where event1 could have occurred before the ""initial"" moment or simultaneously with the initial event2, the truth values might change; under the usual reading that the trace starts with event2 and nothing earlier can be assumed, the conclusion above holds.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 happened, event1 will eventually happen).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition and its truth value
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Because event2 happened initially and Rule A requires event1 to follow event2, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This is a logical OR. Since C1 is true, C2 is true (the disjunction is true regardless of whether event1 already happened or only eventually happens).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 holds, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Event2 did happen initially, so the disjunction is true; C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 holds, C5 is false.

Step 4 — how they relate
- The initial truth of event2 forces C1 to be true, which makes C2 true; the negation C3 is therefore false. C4 is true because event2 is true, so its negation C5 is false.

Final answer
- C5 is False.

False

Answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterwards.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Both events are terminal when they occur.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what are their truth values given the context?
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the initial condition that event1 happened, C1 is True.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication event1 → (event1 or event2). That implication is logically true (indeed P → (P ∨ Q) is a tautology), and in our context the antecedent and consequent are true, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 does hold, C3 is False.
- C4: same as C1, so True.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" This is the conjunction C3 ∧ C4. Since C3 is False, the conjunction is False.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- C5 requires C3 to be True, but C3 asserts that a true statement (C2) is false, so C3 is False. With C4 True but C3 False, C5 = False ∧ True = False.

Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
Step-by-step:

1. Initial: event1 has happened.
2. C1 = (event1 or event2) ⇒ True (since event1 happened).
3. C2 = (event1 → C1). This implication is True (antecedent true and consequent true; also P → (P∨Q) is tautology).
4. C3 = (not C2) ⇒ False (because C2 is True).
5. C4 = (event1 or event2) ⇒ True (same as C1).
6. C5 = (C3 and C4) ⇒ False (False ∧ True = False).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.

Given event2 already happened initially and it is terminal, event1 cannot occur (there is no later point where event1 can happen).

- C1 is false: event1 cannot occur because event2 already happened and prevents any further events.
- C2 is true: the implication C1 → event2 holds. (Either because C1 is false, or because event2 in fact did occur; in classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true.)
- C3 (¬C2) is false because C2 is true.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (true at the start).
- Rules given as background: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen.

2) Transition rules / timeline
- Because event1 has happened and ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 will occur (at some time after event1).
- Once event2 occurs, it is terminal: no further events occur after it.
So there is a timeline where event1 occurs and then event2 occurs (and then nothing else).

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens,"" C2 is the implication (event2 → event2), which is a tautology (always true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is true now (indeed always), C2 definitely holds at some time (so ""eventually C2"" is true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C3 is true, so ""eventually C3"" is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This asserts that C4 is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- C2 is tautologically true, so C3 and then C4 are also true.
- C5 asserts the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

False

Answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the current state) event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So the system forces alternation: starting from the initial event2, the next state will have event1, the next after that event2, and so on (event2 occurs repeatedly/infinite recurrence).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (i.e. there is some current or future state where event2 occurs)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 or C2 — logically equivalent to ""event2 eventually happens"" (redundant).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state — i.e. from the next state, event2 eventually happens.
- C5: C4 does not hold — the negation of C4.

4) How they relate / truth values
- C1 is true: event2 already happened initially and, in any case, will happen again due to the alternation.
- C2 is true (same as C1).
- C3 is true (disjunction of two true statements).
- C4 is true: in the next state (which must be event1), event2 will eventually happen (the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees this).
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step breakdown

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens in the initial state (call it s0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen: once event1 has happened (i.e. in and after s0), no further events occur in any later state. In particular, event2 can never occur in any state after s0.
- After event2, event1 must happen: if event2 ever occurs in some state, then event1 must hold in the following state. (This rule is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (X event2).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” (F C1) — there is some future state where C1 is true.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds” (F C2).
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” (F C3).
- C5: “C4 always holds” (G C4) — at every state, C4 is true.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 happens initially and no events can happen afterward, event2 never occurs in any state.
- Therefore C1 is false in every state (the next state never has event2).
- If C1 is always false, then “eventually C1” (C2) is false in every state. Similarly C3 and C4 are false everywhere (they are nested eventualities over a proposition that never becomes true).
- In particular, C4 is false at the initial state, so it is not true at every state. Hence C5 = “C4 always holds” is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 never occurs (after event1 no events can happen), so C1 is always false, hence all nested eventualities C2–C4 are false at the initial state, so C5 = ""C4 always holds"" is false."

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Reasoning (brief):
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rules force alternation: after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen, so both events will occur (indeed repeatedly). Thus C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") holds.
- C2 (""if event1 happens then C1"") holds because any occurrence of event1 guarantees a subsequent event2 (and event1 already occurred).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") and C4 (""C3 always holds"") therefore hold under the invariant rules.
- If C4 always holds, then C4 certainly holds at some time — so C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e. event1 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: if event2 happens then event1 must (later) happen — logically: event2 ⇒ event1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, no further events occur. Since event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur after that. In the given scenario that means event2 does not occur.

Conclusion from context: event1 = true, event2 = false.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 happens AND event2 happens = event1 ∧ event2. With the context, C1 is false (because event2 is false).
- C2: C1 does not hold = ¬(event1 ∧ event2). Given event2 = false, C2 is true.
- C3: C2 holds OR event1 happens = ¬(event1 ∧ event2) ∨ event1. This simplifies logically:
  ¬(E1 ∧ E2) ∨ E1 ≡ (¬E1 ∨ ¬E2) ∨ E1 ≡ True ∨ ¬E2 ≡ True.
  So C3 is a tautology (always true), and in the specific scenario it is true.
- C4: event1 happens AND event2 happens = same as C1, so C4 is false here.
- C5: If C3 holds then C4 holds = (C3 ⇒ C4).

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because C3 is true and C4 is false in this scenario, the implication C3 ⇒ C4 is false.
- Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C3 = ¬(E1 ∧ E2) ∨ E1 = (¬E1 ∨ ¬E2) ∨ E1 = True, so C3 is always true. C4 = E1 ∧ E2 is false in the given scenario (E2 does not occur). Thus C5 = (C3 ⇒ C4) is True ⇒ False, which is False."

Answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened. So in the initial state event1 is true.
- The context also says ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — both event1 and event2 are terminal (no further events occur after either one).

2) Transition rules between events
- Once event1 has occurred, the system stops (no further events).
- Once event2 has occurred, the system stops.
- Given the initial condition that event1 already happened, there are no further events possible from now on.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"". Since event1 did happen initially, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — an implication. Since C1 is true and C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — this asserts ¬C3. But C3 is true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — says that at some time now or in the future C4 becomes true.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- C1 = true, C2 = true, so C3 = true.
- C4 = not C3 = false, and since no further events or state changes can occur (event1 is terminal), C4 will never become true later.
- Therefore ""C4 eventually holds"" (C5) is false.

So C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

C1 and C2 are true (event1 already happened), so C3 (C1 → C2) is true, hence C4 (¬C3) is false. No future events can change this, so ""C4 eventually holds"" (C5) is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Now the step-by-step breakdown you asked for (I assume “after” means “in the next state,” since C1 is stated as “in the next state”):

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (state s0): event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event2 happens in a state, then event1 happens in the next state.
- If event1 happens in a state, then event2 happens in the next state.
(So the system alternates: s0:event2 → s1:event1 → s2:event2 → s3:event1 → ...)

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (Evaluate each at the initial state s0)
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” At s0 this asks whether event1 happens at s1. True (by the transition rule).
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” Interpreting the first part as “event1 happens in the current state (s0),” this requires event1 at s0 AND C1 true. At s0 event1 does not happen (s0 has event2), so C2 is False.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” This asks whether C2 is true at s1. At s1, event1 does happen, but C1 evaluated at s1 (does event1 happen at s2?) is false because s2 has event2; thus C2 at s1 is False. So C3 (C2 true at s1) is False.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 is False, C4 is True.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” Since C4 is True, C5 is False.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary)
- From the alternation of events, C1 is true at s0, but C2 fails because event1 is not true at s0. That makes C3 false, which makes C4 true, which in turn makes C5 false.

Final verdict: C5 is False.

(If you meant “after” in a weaker sense like “eventually” rather than “next state,” the truth values can change — let me know if you meant that and I’ll re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C5 is False.

I'll walk through the four parts you asked for, using the natural reading that each Ci is evaluated at the current state unless it explicitly mentions ""in the next state"".

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state0) event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the state immediately after a state where event1 happened — state1 — must have event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred, no further events occur).

So the timeline is: state0: event1 happened. Then state1: event2 happens. After state1 there are no further events.

3) What each Ci means (reading each at the state where it is stated):
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” (At state0, this asserts event1 happens at state1.)
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” (Conjunction evaluated at the current state: event1 happens here AND C1 is true.)
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” (Negation of C2 at the current state.)
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” (Negation of C3 at the current state.)
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” (Asserts that C4 is true in the next state.)

4) How they relate / truth values
Evaluate at state0 (initial state):
- C1 at state0: asks whether event1 happens at state1. But by the rules state1 has event2, not event1, so C1 is False.
- C2 at state0: requires event1 happens at state0 (true) AND C1 holds (False). So C2 is False.
- C3 at state0: is “C2 does not hold” → True (because C2 is False).
- C4 at state0: is “C3 does not hold” → False (because C3 is True).

Now C5 asks about C4 in the next state (state1). We must evaluate C4 at state1:
- First find C2 at state1: C2 at state1 = “event1 happens at state1 AND C1 holds at state1 (meaning event1 happens at state2)”. event1 does not happen at state1 (event2 does), so C2 at state1 is False.
- C3 at state1 = “C2 does not hold” → True.
- C4 at state1 = “C3 does not hold” → False.

Therefore C5 = “C4 holds in the next state (state1)” is False.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 must occur later). This rule is irrelevant once we know event2 never occurs, but it is consistent with the other rules.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (a global claim that event2 never occurs)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Interpreting this naturally: at some point (from some time onward) it is true that event2 does not happen. If event2 never happens at all, C1 is already true now and so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") — true for the same reason.
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold — the conjunction of two true statements, so true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — the negation of C4.

4) How they relate and conclusion
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur. Therefore C1 is true; hence C2 and C3 are true; thus C4 is true. C5, being the negation of C4, is false.

(Also: Rule B is vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules (what can happen after what)
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, neither event2 nor any other event can occur afterwards).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs at some time, then event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (asserts event2 happens)
- C2: same as C1 (redundant/repeated)
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" (requires event1 and that event2 always happens)
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" (requires event2 and that C3 holds)
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" (requires C1 and C4)

Step 4 — evaluation and how they relate
- From the initial condition and Rule A: event1 has occurred and after that no other events can occur, so event2 cannot occur at any later time. Therefore event2 does not happen.
- Hence C1 (event2 always happens) is false. C2 is the same, so false.
- C3 requires C2, so C3 is false (even though event1 is true, C2 is false).
- C4 requires event2 and C3; both are false, so C4 is false.
- C5 requires C1 and C4; both are false, so C5 is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- Additional constraints: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either occurs, the execution stops.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event1 occurs initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" there are no transitions that produce any further events. In particular, event2 cannot occur at any later time in this run.
- (More generally, once event1 or event2 occurs the system has no further moves.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Under the given run, event2 never happens (because event1 already happened and prevents any further events). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state with events after the initial state (or, in standard temporal semantics, X C2 is false when there is no next state), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Event2 does not happen and C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is never true at any point, C5 (F C4) is false.

4) How they relate (summary)
- Because event1 occurs initially and blocks any further events, event2 can never occur. That makes C1 false and this falsehood propagates through the definitions of C2–C4, so C4 never becomes true and therefore C5 is false.

Reasoning (brief):
- Let s0 be the initial state where event2 happened.
- s1 is the next state; by the rules, event1 must happen at s1 and then no further events can occur (so event2 does not occur at s1 or later).

Evaluate the Ci at s0:
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false (event2 does not happen at s1).
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (C1 is false at s1).
- C3 (""C2 holds or event2 happens"") is true at s0 because event2 happens at s0.
- C4 (""C3 holds or event2 happens"") is therefore true at s0.
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") asks whether C4 is true at s1. At s1: event2 does not happen and C3 is false there (since C2 is false at s1 and event2 does not occur at s1), so C4 is false at s1. Hence C5 is false."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, the next relevant step has event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate). Starting from the initial event1, the system produces event1, event2, event1, event2, ….

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value in this system)?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""at every time point,"" this is false. Event1 does occur repeatedly (every other step) but not at the steps where event2 occurs, so C1 does not hold.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a true proposition about the system; it therefore holds at all times, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 is true, so this conditional reduces to ""event2 happens."" Given the transition rules (they alternate), event2 does indeed happen. Therefore C4 is true.
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" This asks whether whenever event1 occurs, C4 is true. But C4 is a true statement (holds globally), so the implication is true in every case where event1 happens.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- From the initial/transition rules we derived C1 = False, C2 = True, C3 = True, C4 = True.
- Because C4 is true globally, the implication in C5 (""event1 ⇒ C4"") is true whenever event1 happens.

Therefore C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C4 holds (C3 is true and event2 does occur in the system), so C4 is a true statement; therefore the implication ""if event1 happens then C4 holds"" is true whenever event1 occurs, hence C5 is True."

Summary answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Given the initial event2 and the rules, the system will alternate event2, event1, event2, event1, ... so both events occur repeatedly (infinitely often).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (using standard temporal/read-as-written meanings)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as a plain implication event1 ⇒ event1. This is a tautology (always true): whenever you evaluate it the antecedent equals the consequent, so the implication is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Means C1 is true at every moment (globally). Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Means at some time in the future C2 will be true. Because C2 already holds at all times, C3 is true (it holds immediately).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This asserts ¬C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" This asserts that at some future time C4 is true (i.e., ¬C3 becomes true). But C4 is false at every time (C3 is true now and continues to be true), so C5 is false.

4) How they relate (short chain)
- C1 true → C2 true → C3 true → C4 false → C5 false.

Therefore C5 is false. (If you intended different temporal readings for C1 — e.g., ""if event1 happens now then event1 will happen again in the future"" — say so and I will re-evaluate under that interpretation.)

Answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (i.e. any occurrence of event2 requires a later occurrence of event1).
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (i.e. any occurrence of event1 requires a later occurrence of event2).
- Taken together (and assuming these “must” rules are enforced), any occurrence of one event forces a later occurrence of the other, so starting from the initial event1 you get event2, then event1, then event2, … (an alternating sequence).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — a proposition that is true at a moment if event1 does not occur at that moment (or read as “event1 never occurs” when used under always).
- C2: “C1 always holds” — globally/for all times C1 is true; equivalently, event1 never occurs from now on.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds” — at some future time, C2 becomes true (i.e. from some point onward event1 never occurs).
- C4: “C3 does not hold” — the negation of C3 (i.e. it is not the case that eventually event1 never occurs).
- C5: “Event2 happens and C4 holds” — both that event2 occurs at some point and that C3 is false.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- C1 is false right away because the initial condition says event1 did happen.
- C2 (“event1 never happens”) is therefore false (it fails immediately).
- Because the rules force alternation, event1 will continue to occur infinitely often (after each event2, event1 must occur, and after each event1, event2 must occur). Therefore C2 can never become true in the future, so C3 (“C2 eventually holds”) is false.
- C4 (the negation of C3) is true.
- Event2 does happen (it must happen after the initial event1), so “Event2 happens” is true.
- Therefore C5 = (Event2 happens) AND (C4) = true AND true = True.

Note: This conclusion assumes the “must” rules are enforced (so the obligations are satisfied). If the rules could be violated, then event2 might not happen and the truth could differ; under the usual reading of the given constraints, C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (the system is terminal after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is also terminal if it ever occurs).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (there is some future state where event2 occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does not eventually happen).
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" (conjunction: event2 happens AND event2 does not eventually happen).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (C3 is true at every time/state).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (in the next state, C4 is true).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event1 has already happened and after event1 no further events can occur, event2 cannot happen now or in the future. So C1 is false.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is true.
- C3 asserts ""event2 happens"" AND ""event2 does not happen eventually"" — that is a contradiction (A and not-A). Since event2 does not happen, the conjunct ""event2 happens"" is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false because C3 is already false in the actual state (and remains false).
- C5 asks whether C4 holds in the next state. There is no meaningful next state after the terminal state reached by event1; even if you regard the post-event state as the ""current"" (terminal) state, C4 is false there, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

2) Transition rules

- After event2, event1 must happen → they alternate: event1, then event2, then event1, etc.

3) Meaning / truth of each Ci (standard propositional/temporal reading; ""happens"" means it does occur)
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since event1 already happened, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is ¬C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the implication (C2 → event1). An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously True, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is ¬C3, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is False (already false at the relevant time), C5 is False.

Summary answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (in the current state) event1 happened.
- Additional global facts: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has occurred, no further events occur afterwards.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event1 already happened in the initial state and is terminal, there can be no occurrence of event2 after that. The successor state (if one is considered) has no events happening. The same terminal property applies if event2 had happened.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" This requires both events to occur (at some times); given event1 already happened and no events can occur after it, event2 does not happen. So C1 is False in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since event1 happens in the initial state, C2 is True (true because of the second disjunct).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" At the initial state C2 is True and event1 is True, so the implication is True; thus C3 holds in the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is False in the initial state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must evaluate C4 in the immediate successor state.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation of C5
- In the successor state there are no events (because event1 was terminal). So in the next state:
  - event1 does not happen (no events occur),
  - C1 is still False (event2 never occurred),
  - C2 = (C1 or event1) is False,
  - C3 = (C2 -> event1) is True (a false antecedent makes the implication true),
  - therefore C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is False in the next state.
- Thus ""C4 holds in the next state"" (C5) is False.

(If one instead assumes there is no successor state at all, then C5 is not true either — typically a ""next"" formula is considered false at a terminal state.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: in the next state no events occur. There C1 is false and event1 is false, so C2 is false, hence C3 (C2 → event1) is true, so C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false. Therefore C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.
- Extra facts: “After event1, no other events can happen” and “After event2, no other events can happen.” So both event1 and event2 are terminal (if either occurs, nothing else occurs afterwards). Given the initial condition, event1 has occurred; event2 does not occur after that.

2) Transition rules
- There are no transitions leaving event1.
- There are no transitions leaving event2.
(That simply means neither event allows any further events once it happens.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event1 happens.” This is the implication P → P with P = “event1 happens.” In standard logic P → P is a tautology (always true).
- C2: Same as C1, so also a tautology (always true).
- C3: “If event1 happens, then C2 holds.” Since C2 is true (tautologically), the implication “event1 → C2” is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C4: “C1 holds and C3 holds.” Conjunction of two true statements, so C4 is true.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” That is the negation of C4.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C1 and C2 are true (tautologies).
- C3 is true because its consequent C2 is true.
- Therefore C4 (C1 ∧ C3) is true.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

Note: This conclusion assumes standard material implication / propositional logic reading of the “if … then …” statements. If you intended a different logic (e.g., some non-classical or temporal/modal reading), tell me which and I can re-evaluate.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at time t0).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 occurs, event2 will occur at some later point).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 will occur again later).
- Interpreting ""must happen"" as a guarantee of occurrence (not a mere obligation).

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Since event1 already happened at t0, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (Same as C1) — true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true (and in fact event2 will also happen after event1, so C3 is true regardless).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is true and C3 is true, so the implication C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" We know event2 will happen after the initial event1, and we have C4 true, so both parts of the conjunction hold.

Step 4 — how they relate and final conclusion
- Timeline: t0: event1 (given) → some t1: event2 (required) → some t2: event1 (required) → ...
- From the timeline and the truth values above, C1, C2, C3, C4 are all true, and event2 does occur.
- Therefore C5 (event2 happens AND C4 holds) is true.

Answer: C5 is True.

(If one instead reads ""must happen"" as only a deontic obligation that might not be fulfilled, the conclusion could change; the above assumes ""must"" means the event will indeed occur.)

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (in the initial state) event2 has happened.
- Rules: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event2 occurs (which it does initially) no further events can ever occur; likewise if event1 ever occurred it would block further events.

2) Transition/occurrence consequences
- Because event2 already happened initially and it prevents any other events thereafter, event1 can never occur at any later time. (There is no state in which event1 becomes true at or after the initial state.)
- The ""after event1 ..."" clause is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs.

3) Meaning of each Ci (using standard temporal operators)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — read as G(event1): event1 holds in all future states.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — F(C1) = F(G(event1)): at some future point from then on event1 holds forever.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — X(C2).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — X(X(C2)).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — X(X(X(C2))).

4) Relation and evaluation
- Since event1 never occurs in any state (because event2 already occurred and forbids further events), G(event1) is false in every state. Hence C1 is false everywhere.
- If C1 is never true, F(C1) (C2) is false (there is no future state where C1 becomes true).
- If C2 is false now, it is also false in the next state, the next next state, etc., so X(C2), X(X(C2)), X(X(X(C2))) are all false.
- Therefore C3, C4, and C5 are all false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
(So either event occurring puts the system into a terminal state with no further events.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — event2 never occurs (from the initial point onward).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate next state, event2 does not happen.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — at some future point, the property C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — either C3 is true or event1 occurs.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — the negation of C4.

4) How they relate (logical reasoning)
- Since event1 has already happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot happen at any future point. Therefore C1 is true.
- If event2 never happens, then in every next state event2 does not happen, so C2 is true (in particular it is true in the immediate next state).
- If C2 is true now, then ""eventually C2 holds"" is certainly true, so C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 or event1"": both disjuncts are true here (event1 happened initially and C3 is true), so C4 is true.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition / occurrence rules
- Rule A: After event1 occurs, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has occurred, no subsequent occurrence of event2 (or any other event) is possible.
- Rule B: If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards (i.e., event2 → eventually event1). 

With the given initial condition (event1 already happened), Rule A prevents any further events ever occurring, so event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given Rule A and the initial event1, C1 is false (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" This is the disjunction (event2) ∨ C1. Since both disjuncts are false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is ¬C2. Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is ¬C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" This is (event2) ∨ C4. Both disjuncts are false, so C5 is false.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen afterward, event2 never occurs. That makes C1 false, which cascades as shown: C2 false → C3 true → C4 false → C5 false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next (or eventually next in the following states).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
- With event2 true initially and these mutual obligations, the system must alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... — an infinite alternation in which event2 occurs now and infinitely often thereafter.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology p → p (true whenever you interpret it as “event2 implies event2”); it is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 holds in every state, it certainly holds in the next state, so C2 is true in any state that has a next state (and our alternating trace provides next states).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 already holds now (or at some future point), then C3 is true. Given C2 holds now (and in every state), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is simply the negation of C3. Because C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" This is the conjunction of (event2) and (C4). While event2 does happen (initially and repeatedly), C4 is false, so the conjunction is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- Chain: C1 is true ⇒ C2 is true ⇒ C3 is true ⇒ C4 is false.
- Therefore C5 = (event2) ∧ C4 = True ∧ False = False.

(Assumption: standard semantics with an infinite execution trace or at least a defined next state after the initial state. If the model disallows a next state, C2 could be undefined/false; that only makes C3 false as well and would not make C5 true.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (p → p for event2) is always true, so C2 and hence C3 hold. Therefore C4 (the negation of C3) is false. C5 = (event2) ∧ C4 is false because C4 is false (even though event2 holds)."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at the start) event2 has happened.
- Hence at the initial moment event2 = true.

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (once event2 has occurred, there are no further events at later times).
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must also occur sometime at that same moment or later).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2: C1 OR (event1 happens).
- C3: same as C1 (event1 AND event2).
- C4: C2 AND C3.
- C5: “C4 always holds” — i.e. C4 is true at all times (a global/always truth).

4) How they relate and truth values under the given rules
- Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 no further events can occur, event1 cannot occur at any later time. (Unless you allow simultaneous occurrence at the initial instant; see note below.) So under the standard reading:
  - event2 = true
  - event1 = false
- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1 = event1 AND event2 = false (since event1 is false).
  - C2 = C1 OR event1 = false.
  - C3 = same as C1 = false.
  - C4 = C2 AND C3 = false.
  - C5 = “C4 always holds” = false (because C4 is not true).

Therefore C5 is False.

Note on simultaneous occurrence: if you allow event1 to have occurred exactly at the same initial instant as event2 (so both are true at time 0), then C1 and C3 would be true at that instant and C2 and C4 true at that instant, and C5 would depend on whether “always” requires truth at all times after the initial instant (it would fail later because no further times let C4 continue if it must hold at all times); under the usual interpretation that “after event2 no other events can happen” and only event2 happened initially, the natural reading gives event1 = false and thus C5 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 already happened and prevents any later events, so event1 cannot occur. That makes C1/C3 false, hence C4 false, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false."

Step 0 — assumptions/reading
- Events: event1 and event2.
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" means at the initial moment (now) event1 has already occurred.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" means once event1 occurs there are no further occurrences of any events (including event2) at any later time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" is irrelevant once event1 has already happened initially, because no later events are possible.

Now the four parts:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred at the initial time; therefore, by the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no events (including event2) can ever occur in the future.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event2 occurs at some time t, then event1 must occur at some time t' > t.
- Rule B: If event1 occurs at some time t, then no events can occur at any t' > t (event1 is terminal).
- Because event1 already occurred initially, Rule B blocks any future event2 from ever occurring.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — simply means event2 happens (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — still just requires event2 to happen (since C1 is equivalent to event2).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there will be some future time when event2 occurs.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — at every time point, it is true that eventually event2 will occur (i.e., from every time onward, event2 will happen sometime later).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — C4 is true at every time point (a global, nested always).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C5?
- From the initial condition + Rule B, event2 cannot occur at any future time. So any condition that requires event2 (C1, C2, C3) is false.
- C1 is false ⇒ C2 false ⇒ C3 (""eventually C2"") is false.
- C4 (""always C3"") is false because C3 is false (it must hold at every time but does not).
- C5 (""always C4"") is therefore false.

Final answer: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal — nothing may occur after it).
- Rule B: After event2 happens, event1 must happen later (event2 implies event1 will occur afterwards).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: same as C1 — also ""event2 happens.""
- C3: C1 and C2 — still just ""event2 happens.""
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e. ""event2 happens at some (future) time.""
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens"" — i.e. ""event2 happens and (event2 eventually happens)."" In short, C5 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event1 has already happened initially and rule A forbids any events after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. (If one allowed event2 in the past before the initial moment, that would be a different modeling choice; under the usual forward-time reading with the given initial condition, event2 does not happen.)
- Therefore C1, C2, C3 are false (event2 does not happen), C4 is false (event2 does not eventually happen), and hence C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened (so event2 is true now).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs in some state, then event2 occurs afterwards.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 occurs in a state, all subsequent states have no events.)

3) What each Ci means
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — a statement about whichever state we're evaluating (a disjunction).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — the implication event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2). This implication is always true whenever event1 is false (vacuously), and trivially true whenever event1 is true because the consequent contains event1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — in the current state we assert that, in the immediately following state, the implication C2 is true.
- C4: ""event2 happens and C3 holds"" — both event2 is true now and C2 is true in the next state.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — the negation of C4.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- In the initial state event2 is true by assumption.
- Because event2 happened, the rule “after event2 no other events can happen” means the next state has no events: in particular, event1 does not happen in the next state.
- Evaluate C2 in that next state: since event1 does not happen there, the implication event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2) is vacuously true. So C2 holds in the next state, hence C3 is true in the initial state.
- Now C4 = (event2 happens now) ∧ C3. Both conjuncts are true (event2 is true now, C3 true), so C4 holds in the initial state.
- Therefore C5, which asserts ""C4 does not hold"", is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- Additional rules: once event1 occurs, no further events can occur (the execution is then terminal). Similarly, if event2 occurs it is terminal. In the actual run we are given, event1 happens initially, so thereafter no events occur.

2) Transition rules
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal events: after either one occurs, the system stays in an eventless suffix (no further occurrences of either event).
- Because event1 already happened initially, the rest of the timeline contains no occurrences of event1 or event2.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. event1 does not hold.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — in temporal logic: Globally (always) ¬event1; event1 never holds at any state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — in temporal logic: Next (Globally ¬event1). From the next state onward, event1 never occurs.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — Globally (Next (Globally ¬event1)). At every state, the next state has the property that event1 never occurs afterwards.

4) How they relate and truth values
- C1 is true at the initial state (event1 happened).
- C2 (¬event1) is false at the initial state.
- C3 (always ¬event1) is false when evaluated at the initial state (because event1 did occur there). However, C3 is true when evaluated at any state strictly after the initial state, because after the initial event1 no further events occur.
- C4 says ""in the next state, C3 holds."" From the initial state this is true: the next state is in the suffix where event1 never occurs, so C3 holds in that next state. More generally, for any state in this run, the next state (if it exists) lies in the eventless suffix and therefore has C3 true.
- Therefore C4 holds at every state of the run (initial and all later states).
- Hence C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.

Conclusion: Given the context, C5 is True.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened in the initial state.
- Also given: once event2 has happened, no further events can ever occur.

2) Transition rules between events?
- If event2 has occurred, the system is terminal: no other events (including event1) can happen after that point.
- If event1 ever happens, the rule requires that event2 must happen afterwards. (But in the given trace event2 already happened initially, so event1 cannot occur after that.)

3) What each Ci means (informal temporal reading)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., in every state, event2 happens in the next state).
- C3: ""Event1 happens (now) and C2 holds.""
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (in every state, event1 happens now and C2 holds).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (there is some future state where C3 holds in all states from that point, per the usual reading of eventually).

4) How they relate and truth values under the given context
- Given event2 already happened initially and that event2 makes the system terminal, there will be no next-state event occurrences. So C1 is false (event2 does not ""happen in the next state"").
- Since C1 is false, ""always C1"" is false → C2 is false.
- C3 requires event1 to happen now and C2 to hold; event1 does not happen (no events after initial) and C2 is false → C3 is false.
- C4 (""always C3"") is false because C3 is false.
- C5 (""eventually C4"") is false because C4 never becomes true.

Therefore C5 is False.

(If you intended a different semantic reading — for example treating ""event2 has happened"" as a persistent past fact that remains true in every subsequent state — re-evaluate C1 accordingly. Under the standard reading of ""happens in the next state"" as an occurrence at that next state, the conclusion above stands.)

False

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What each sub-condition means (and its truth value given the context)?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This implication is True, because C1 is true and C2 is true (an implication with true antecedent and true consequent is true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False, because C3 does hold.
- Additional fact: from the transition rule and the fact event1 happened, event2 must happen; therefore ""Event2 happens"" is True.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation of C5
- C5 is ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" We have (Event2 happens) = True and C4 = False, so (True OR False) = True.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After an occurrence of event1, event2 must happen next.
- After an occurrence of event2, event1 must happen next.
So the system alternates: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...

3) Meaning of the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens"" — i.e. at the current moment either event1 or event2 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — negation of C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — C2 ∨ event1.
- C4: ""event1 happens and C3 holds"" — event1 ∧ C3.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — C4 must be true at every moment in time.

4) How they relate / evaluation
- At the initial moment: event1 is true, so C1 is true. Hence C2 is false. C3 = C2 ∨ event1 = false ∨ true = true. C4 = event1 ∧ C3 = true ∧ true = true. So C4 holds initially.
- At the next moment (when event2 occurs): event2 is true and event1 is false. So C1 = true (because event2 is true), C2 = false, C3 = C2 ∨ event1 = false ∨ false = false, and C4 = event1 ∧ C3 = false ∧ false = false. Thus C4 does not hold at the times when event2 occurs.

Since the system alternates, there are times (all the event2 moments) where C4 is false. Therefore C4 is not true at all moments, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C4 requires event1 to hold. At the moments when event2 occurs (which do occur), event1 is false, so C4 is false then; therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., event2 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does happen).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal, but that does not undo the fact that event2 already happened).

3) What each condition means
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., event2 is false)
- C2: same as C1 (redundant)
- C3: C1 and C2 — equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen"" (still false if event2 did happen)
- C4: ""If event1 happens then C3 holds."" Formally: event1 → C3
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" i.e., ¬(event1 → C3). In classical logic this is true exactly when event1 is true and C3 is false (antecedent true, consequent false).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- From the context: event2 happened, so C1 = False and C2 = False.
- Therefore C3 = False.
- Because event2 happened and the rule says event1 must then happen, event1 = True.
- C4 (event1 → C3) is then False (true antecedent, false consequent).
- C5 = ¬C4 is therefore True.

So C5 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules (after-occurrence rules)?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — if event1 occurs at some time, it is terminal: no further events occur after it.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — likewise, if event2 occurs at some time, it is terminal.
- Since event2 already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state: no further events (including event1) can occur.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There exists some future time at which event1 occurs.)
- C2: same as C1 (the statement is repeated).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" i.e. event1 does not eventually happen.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" i.e. at every time point, it is true that event1 does not eventually happen.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" i.e. event1 eventually happens AND, at every time point, event1 does not eventually happen.

4) How they relate and evaluation:
- Because event2 has already happened and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen now or in the future. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (event1 does not eventually happen).
  - C2 is false (same as C1).
  - C3 is true (C2 does not hold).
  - C4 is true: at every time point the future still contains no event1, so ""event1 does not eventually happen"" holds always.
- C5 requires both C1 (false) and C4 (true). The conjunction is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start (so at time 0, proposition event1 is true).
- Extra context: after event1 no further events can occur (so the system halts after event1); and there's a rule “after event2, event1 must happen” which is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs in the given trace.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event1 occurs initially and “after event1 no other events can happen,” the trace has event1 at time 0 and nothing afterwards. Thus event2 never occurs in this particular system run; no additional transitions happen after time 0.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
Interpreting standard temporal operators: “always” = G, “eventually” = F, “does not hold” = ¬.

- C1: “If event1 happens, then event1 happens” — formal: event1 → event1. This is a logical tautology (true in every state whether event1 holds or not).
- C2: “C1 eventually holds” — F(C1). Because C1 is true in every state (including now), F(C1) is true.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — ¬C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 always holds” — G(C3). Because C3 is false now (and in fact never true), G(C3) is false.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds” — F(C4). Since C4 never holds, F(C4) is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- C1 is true everywhere, so C2 is true.
- C3 negates C2, so C3 is false.
- C4 asserts something always true about C3, but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5 asks whether C4 holds at some future time; since C4 never holds, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened (call this the initial state S0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from S0 the next state S1 has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (S1 is terminal; no further transitions).

So the only possible execution is: S0 (event1) → S1 (event2) and then stop.

3) Meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting this as “event2 inevitably occurs in every possible execution” — given the rules, that is true (every run contains event2).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" This requires both C2 (false) and C3 (true), so C4 is false (false ∧ true = false).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" This asks whether C4 is true when evaluated at the next state (S1).

4) How they relate / evaluation
- Since C4 is false in every state (it contains the contradiction C2 ∧ C3), C4 is not true in the next state.
- Therefore C5 is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward (i.e., event2 implies a later occurrence of event1).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, the system has no further events).

Because event1 has already happened initially and Rule B forbids any further events after event1, event2 can never occur in any future state.

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1). This is true now because event1 already happened in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). Since C1 holds now, F C1 is true. (In temporal logic F(F p) ≡ F p, so this is equivalent to C1.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2). By the same reasoning, this is true and equivalent to C1/C2.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" — requires both that C3 is true and that event2 holds at the same state. C3 is true, but event2 never happens (see rule B), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — requires C4 to be true at the immediate successor state. Because C4 is never true at any state (event2 never occurs), C5 is false.

4) How they relate
- C1, C2, C3 are all true (they are equivalent here because event1 already holds and nesting of ""eventually"" collapses).
- C4 is false because it additionally demands event2, which cannot occur after the initial event1.
- C5 is therefore false.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it already occurred at the start).
- Extra facts: both events are terminal — “after event2, no other events can happen” and “after event1, no other events can happen.” Since event2 already happened initially, no further events (in particular event1) can ever happen after that.

Step 2 — transition / occurrence rules
- If event2 happens, that ends the run (no other events can happen afterwards).
- If event1 happens, that also ends the run.
- Because event2 has already happened initially, the system is in a terminal state and event1 cannot occur at any later time.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “If event2 happens, then event2 happens.” This is a trivially true implication here (antecedent is true and consequent is true; or seen as a logical tautology).
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event1 happens.” This asserts that whenever C1 is true, event1 must occur.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” This asserts C2 is true (in particular, under the actual initial state).
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” This is the negation of C3.
- C5: “If C4 holds, then event1 happens.” This asserts that whenever C3 is false, event1 must occur.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth-values
- C1 holds (true).
- Because C1 holds, C2 requires event1 to happen. But event1 cannot happen (event2 has already happened and prevents any further events), so C2 is false.
- Since C2 is false, C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false.
- Therefore C4 (“C3 does not hold”) is true.
- C5 is the implication “If C4 holds, then event1 happens.” We have C4 true but event1 cannot happen, so the implication is false.

Summary answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition (state s0): event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen: so in the state immediately following any state where event2 occurred, event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen: the state immediately after a state with event1 has no events (it is terminal/no-event).

So the actual trace from the initial state s0 is:
- s0: event2
- s1 (next state): event1  (forced by the rule)
- s2 (state after that): no events (since after event1 no events can happen)
- and thereafter no events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting ""next"" relative to the current evaluation state)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" → at a given state t, C1 means event2 happens at t+1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" → at state t, C2 means C1 is true at t+1, i.e. event2 happens at t+2.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" → at every state t, C2 is true; equivalently, at every state t, event2 would happen at t+2.
- C4: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" → same as C1: event2 at t+1.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" → either C3 is true (C2 holds at every state) or C4 is true (event2 at t+1).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and final evaluation?
- Evaluate at the initial state s0:
  - C1 at s0: asks whether event2 happens at s1. No — s1 has event1. So C1 is false at s0.
  - C2 at s0: asks whether event2 happens at s2. No — s2 has no events. So C2 is false at s0.
  - C3 at s0: ""C2 always holds"" is false because we already have a counterexample (C2 is false at s0).
  - C4 at s0: same as C1, false.
  - C5 at s0: C3 OR C4 is false OR false = false.

Therefore C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

At the initial state s0: s1 has event1 (not event2) and s2 has no events. So C4 (event2 at next state) is false, C2/C3 are false, hence C5 = C3 OR C4 is false."

Reason: let s0 be the initial state (event1 happened) and let event2 occur at some later state sk (it must occur after event1).

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after event2).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Thus the actual execution is: event2 occurs (initially), then event1 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What each Ci means (and its truth value under the above execution)
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Since both event2 and event1 do happen in the execution, C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" (same as C1) — True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds (immediately), so C2 certainly holds at some time; therefore C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" This is an implication. The antecedent C1 is True while the consequent C4 is False, so the implication is False.

4) How they relate
- C1 and C2 are true because at least one of the two events happens (in fact both happen).
- C3 is true because C2 holds (so it holds eventually).
- C4 denies C3, so C4 is false.
- C5 asserts that C1 implies C4; because C1 is true but C4 is false, C5 is false.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so there will be an event2 following any event1).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so there will be an event1 following any event2).
- Together these rules force an alternation: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, … (repeatedly).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — logically: C2 = (not event1) OR (event2 happens).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., at all relevant times/points, C2 is true.
- C4: same as C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds"" — both must be true.

(There is an implicit temporal reading: these statements quantify over occurrences in time. The natural reading here is that C1/C4 assert that event1 never happens, and C3 asserts that C2 holds at every time.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C5?
- From the given initial condition, event1 did happen, so C1 is false (and so is C4).
- The transition rules guarantee event2 does happen (after the initial event1), so the disjunction in C2 is true at least at some times. But C3 requires that C2 be true at all times.
- At the time of the initial event1, event1 is happening and event2 is not happening then, so C2 = (not event1) OR event2 is false at that time. Therefore C2 does not hold at all times, so C3 is false.
- Since both C3 and C4 are false, their conjunction C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and the initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time t0, event1 happens.

2) Transition rules between events
- After an occurrence of event1 the next event must be event2.
- After an occurrence of event2 the next event must be event1.
- Thus the system produces an alternating sequence: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … (repeats forever).

3) What each sub-condition means (simplify them)
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is redundant and is equivalent to the single proposition ""event1 happens"".
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — this is ""if event1 then event1"", which is a tautology (always true) in classical logic.
- C3: same as C1, so again ""event1 happens"".
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" — since C2 is always true, C4 is equivalent to C3, i.e. C4 ≡ ""event1 happens"".
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — this means ""event1 holds at every time"" (globally).

4) How they relate and the truth of C5
- Because C4 ≡ ""event1 happens"", C5 asserts that event1 is true at every time.
- But from the transition rules we have an alternating trace: event1 is true at t0, t2, t4, … and false at t1, t3, …
- Therefore C4 does not hold at times when event2 occurs, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.

If you intended a different reading of ""or"" or ""always"" (for example, referring only to the initial moment rather than globally), say so and I’ll re-evaluate under that interpretation.

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially (at time 0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules between events?
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” So whenever event1 occurs, some later time must exist at which event2 occurs.
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” So whenever event2 occurs, some later time must exist at which event1 occurs.
Thus once event1 happens (initially), the rules force event2 to happen later, then event1 again, etc. (an alternating sequence).

3) What do the sub-conditions mean?
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (no occurrence of event2)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” i.e. at all times, event2 does not happen (equivalently: event2 never happens).
- C3: “Event2 does not happen.” (same as C1)
- C4: “C2 holds or C3 holds.” i.e. (event2 never happens) OR (event2 does not happen now).
- C5: “C4 always holds.” i.e. at every time point C4 is true.

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- Because event1 happened initially and the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” applies, event2 must occur at some later time. Therefore the statement “event2 does not happen” is false in the overall system (event2 does happen), so C1 (and C3) is not globally true.
- C2 (Event2 never happens) is false.
- C4 is a disjunction of C2 and C3. C3 might be true at some moments (for example at the initial instant before event2 has occurred), so C4 can be true at some times. But C5 requires C4 to be true at all times.
- At the time when event2 actually occurs, “event2 does not happen” is false, and C2 is false, so C4 is false at that time. Hence C4 is not always true, so C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False (there is a concrete timeline starting from the initial event1 that makes C4 fail at the time event2 occurs).

Reason: event1 happens initially and no further events can occur, so event2 never happens. Because event1 did happen, C1 (""event1 -> event2"") is false (event1 true, event2 never).

False.

Reasoning (concise):
- C2 requires event1 to hold at the current state and event2 to hold in the next state. But the context says ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so there cannot be event2 in the next state if event1 holds now. Thus C2 is impossible (false at any state).
- C3 (same as C1) says ""event2 happens in the next state."" At the initial state event2 already happened, and the context requires event1 to occur after that, so event2 does not occur in the next state. Hence C3 is not guaranteed and is false at the initial state.
- Therefore C4 = C2 or C3 is not true at all states, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start (time 0).
- Also given: once event1 has happened, no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 happens at some time, then at some later time event1 must happen).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs the run stops; there are no later occurrences of event2 or any event).

Because event1 happens initially and is terminal, no event2 ever occurs in the run, and the obligation ""after event2 event1 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied (there is no occurrence of event2 to trigger it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A) and therefore true in every state where the formula is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Means there exists some (possibly current) time in the future at which C1 is true. Since C1 is already true now, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same pattern: because C2 holds now, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" By the same reasoning, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This asserts the negation of C4.

4) How do these conditions relate and conclusion?
- C1 is true immediately (tautology). Therefore C2 is true (eventually C1 holds — already holds). By repeating that reasoning, C3 and C4 are also true.
- C5 asserts that C4 does not hold, but we have just shown C4 does hold. Therefore C5 is false.

Final verdict: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

C1 (p → p) is a tautology and holds now, so C2, C3, and C4 (each ""eventually"" of the previous) all hold; C5 asserts ¬C4, which is false."
