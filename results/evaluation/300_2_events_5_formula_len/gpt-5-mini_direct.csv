Reason: C5 asserts that in every state the next state satisfies C3, so every state's successor must have event1.

Explanation (brief): Initially event2 happened and after event2 no further states occur, so event1 never happens. Thus C1 is vacuously true, C2 and C3 are true, but C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state. Therefore C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true (a conditional with a false antecedent is true)."

C2: Event1 happens or event1 happens.
C3: C2 eventually holds.

Reason (brief):
Let s0 be the initial state (event2 happened). Then e1 is true at s1, e2 at s2, e1 at s3, etc.
- C1: e1 at s1 — True.
- C2 (at s0): ""e1 (now) and C1"" — e1 at s0 is False, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = C2 at s1. At s1, e1 is True but C1 (which at s1 means e1 at s2) is False, so C2 at s1 is False => C3 is False.
